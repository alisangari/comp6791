reut2-021.sgm, HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS, Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf likebeacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel andconcrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one sectionof the structure remained.    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after anAmerican helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said hadbeen caught laying mines.    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defenseofficials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkwormmissiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursdayand the Sea Isle City on Friday.    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, akey backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle Eastnow with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaititankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the levelof violence and threats to shipping had increased as a resultof U.S. intervention and Iran's response.    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of aU.S. "tit-for-tat" policy that gave Iran the initiative, saidHarlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.    He said with this appraoch America would suffer "the deathof one thousand cuts."    But for the United States to grab the initiativemilitarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran'sharbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which itsshipping must pass, Schuler said.    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringingIran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomaticinitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose anarms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.    He said the United States should also threaten to mine andblockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq toacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of asettlement.    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war byinvading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for theoutbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-styleinfantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.    Each side has attacked the others' shipping. Reuter&#3;

reut2-021.sgm, GM &lt;GM> CANADA UNIT MAJOR OFFER ACCEPTED BY UNION, The Canadian Auto Workers' Union said itaccepted an economic offer from the Canadian division ofGeneral Motors Corp &lt;GM> in contract negotiations.    But union president Bob White said many local issues at the11 plants in Ontario and Quebec still remained unresolved aheadof Thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers.    "It minimizes the possibility of a strike," White toldreporters.    However, "if we don't have local agreements settled byThursday, there will be a strike," he said.    The local issues still unresolved involved health care,skilled trades and job classifications, White said.    GM Canada negotiator Rick Curd said he believed a strikewould be avoided.    "Even though there are some tough issues to be resolvedwe're on the right schedule to meet the target," Curd said.    "I'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations," hesaid.    Union membership meetings have been scheduled for theweekend in case a tentative settlement, said White.    White said the union has also received assurances that ajob protection pact negotiated with GM workers in the U.S. doesnot threaten Canadian jobs.    The economic offer for a three-year pact largely matchesagreements at Ford &lt;F> and Chrysler &lt;C> in Canada, whichinclude inflation-indexed payments for future retirees andfixed annual payments for current retirees.

reut2-021.sgm, DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED, A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platformin the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raidcarefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Araballies, Western diplomats in the region said.    U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday thatU.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulfin response to a missile strike on the American-registeredKuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.    "We consider the matter closed," he said, a signal the U.S.administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the dayagainst exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military actionwould endanger American interests.    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's WarInformation Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a"crushing blow."    "The United States has entered a swamp from which it can inno way get out safely," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoidostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman onNovember 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently inDamascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help inpreventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arabstates could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, theysaid.    "The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran torespond one way or the other," a diplomat said.    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger Americancountermeasures if the military escalation continued.    Western diplomats and military sources in the area saidshelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative actthe United States could have taken once it had decided toretaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americansand Kuwaitis on Iran.    "It's interesting that they chose something in internationalwaters because it doesn't implicate any other nation," onediplomat said. "This was better for U.S. Relations with the GulfArab states, particularly Kuwait."    Commented another diplomat: "Kuwait must be happy that theU.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attackedon its doorstep."    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: "Theymanaged to warn off the crew and hit something that was theleast nuisance to everybody."    A diplomat commented: "They were very clever in the placethey chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastatedanything because it wasn't working in the first place."    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans)." Reuter&#3;

reut2-021.sgm, LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US, Military experts say the United Statesfaces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of anIranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on aU.S.-flagged tanker.    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and islikely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict aslong as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launchinglimited retaliatory strikes.    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, ordestroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.    "Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as thecycle of attack and retaliation continues," said Fred Axelgard,a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic andInternational Studies (CSIS).    "It's like a Greek tragedy," said retired Adm. Eugene Carrollof Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)think tank.    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is forWashington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end tothe war between Iran and Iraq.    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy beganescorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, whichPresident Reagan could never accept.    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagonnews conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoelfired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostamoil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulftime (0700 EDT) on Monday.    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a militarybase by Iran and that the attack responded to an IranianSilkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker SeaIsle City on Friday.    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance andallowed to escape.    "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we willbe prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iranwith stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.    "We consider this matter closed," he said.    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservativesagreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did notescalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question waswhether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not takenthis view after earlier clashes. Reuter&#3;

The drafting of retaliation options follows the failureof high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filedby the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differentialexport taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports incompetition with the U.S.    "Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict(Argentine) access to our market," said one U.S. source.       The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year afterTrade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed toend the differential.    But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.    Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agricultureminister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroilleon September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could notnarrow the differential further for 1987/88.    As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is consideringrestrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beefand finished leather, the U.S. sources said.

reut2-021.sgm, YUGOSLAVIA DEBT PAYMENTS TO BE ADJUSTED TO EXPORTS, Yugoslav Prime Minister Branko Mikulic,unveiling a new draft economic program, said Yugoslavia wouldcut repayments on its almost 20 billion lr hard currency debtto bring them in line with its hard currency earning capacity.    "We have decided to coordinate repayment of our debt withrealistically assessed capabilities of our economy," he said inParliament. He said the current debt-service ratio (over 40 pctof export revenue) was too high.    Yugoslavia is to negotiate a long-term restructuring of itsdebt after missing repayments in recent months, Mikulic said.    "If we did not change the dynamics of repaying our debt, thesituation would become increasingly worse," Mikulic said.    He said on the present repayment schedule, Yugoslavia wouldhave a net outflow of two billion dlrs and the level of debtwould be halved by 1995. But he added:    "The consequences would not only mean slower economic growthin the coming years but also further exhaustion of the economyand lasting damage to the economy's capacity for development,"he said.    "All that would, of course, intensify social difficulties,"Mikulic added.    The state news agency Tanjug said on October 9 thatYugoslavia plans to adjust debt repayments over the next eightyears and to cut the debt-service ratio to 25 pct.    Yugoslavia failed to make a principal repayment due lastmonth which had already been postponed by 90 days.    Mikulic's proposed economic program, which also includeshigher personal taxes as well as wage and price restraint, isintended to serve as a basis for the debt talks to demonstrateYugoslavia's ability to eventually repay the credits.    His program has to be discussed and approved by parliamentby early November.    Mikulic said foreign debt should be retained at about thesame level as now until 1990 and the country should then beable to keep currency reserves equal to three months payments.    "Of course, these are our proposals for talks withcreditors. We expect understanding and support because it is intheir interest as well," Mikulic said.    He said that under the present schedule debt payments hadslowed economic development and exhausted currency reserves.Banking sources say Yugoslavia's reserves are inadequate atpresent for even one month's debt and import bill.

reut2-021.sgm, SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT, Recent announcements from Moscow ofnext year's grain production targets indicate that the Sovietsare estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,Agriculture Department analysts said.    USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, butsome earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.    Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst ofSoviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article inIzvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year."    "This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213mln tonne (grain) crop," the analyst said.       In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figurepublished in a Soviet economic journal this month.    USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects arange of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.    Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvestprogress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.    While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agricultureofficial Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would beas good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.    A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mlntonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems wouldbring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes. Reuter&#3;

reut2-021.sgm, AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT, Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing onworld markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gainsthat followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in theGulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.    December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents beforefalling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.    "Fundamentals are awful," said Philip Lambert, analyst withstockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPECproduction in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mlnbpd, little changed from September levels.    Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPECproduction could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter andInternational Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC Septemberproduction at 18.5 mln bpd.    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit ofa Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the SeaIsle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flagcommercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in thearea on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil onMonday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.Attack, analysts said.    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through whicharound eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not inthe interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase inthe number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulfhostilities, analysts said.    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranianmissile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.    "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspondto Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that anyfurther action will be met with a like-for-like response.Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said.    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "aresponsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating toIran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iranchose to raise the level of conflict.    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved asArab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose intereststhe U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as aresult of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranianretaliation.    The initial upward market move this morning reflected astrong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack whichwas thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missilelaunchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navyattack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence SecretaryCaspar Weinburger.    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in theGulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it lessserious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,analysts and traders said.

reut2-021.sgm, FED'S JOHNSON WARNS AGAINST LOWER DOLLAR, Federal Reserve Board Vice-ChairmanManuel Johnson cautioned against seeking "quick-fix solutions" topersistent U.S. trade and federal budget deficits.    In particular, he told an American Stock Exchangeconference, a decline in the dollar below current levels wouldexacerbate financial market conditions.    "Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely belowcurrent levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditionsand lead to further potential for financial problems."    Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S.businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates.    He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persistingdespite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in thepast two years.    But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soonbegin showing improvement.    "The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructiveexpansion without inflationary instability," he said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-021.sgm, SWISS PLAN CHANGE IN LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT, The Swiss Banking Commission hopes tointroduce a major reform of the banking system in January whichwould revolutionise the workings of the country's unusualliquidity requirements.    Commission Director Kurt Hauri told Reuters the mainconsequence of the change would be an end to the sharp rise ininterest rates which occurs at the end of every month.    By effectively reducing liquidity requirements, it wouldalso help Swiss banks compete better against those in Britain,West Germany and the United States, he said.    The commission wants to move to a system of averageliquidity requirements, where banks have to hold reservesequivalent to a certain proportion of their exposure calculatedover the month as a whole.    The current system, described  as a Swiss special case byHauri, forces banks to comply with requirements generally onlyat the end of each month.    The result is a sharp upward trend in short dated moneymarket rates, overshadowed by the approach of the end-month,called the ultimo, with consequent high costs for the banks whoare forced to borrow extra funds from the National Bank.    This was particularly pronounced in June 1986 whenovernight rates hit triple figures, due to a combination of thehalf-year end and a rigid adherence by the National Bank to itsmoney supply target. Although the rise shocked the bank intomore flexibility, the problem remained.    The reform proposal, which Hauri said had been planned foryears, was given to banks and other interested parties forcomment on September 30.    They have until the end of this month to suggestalterations. Subject to such changes, and to the governmentgo-ahead, it will come into force on January 1, Hauri said. REUTER&#3;

The court denied a Northrop appeal challenging a U.S.arbitration tribunal's ruling that it pay 31 mln dlrs incommissions and interest stemming from arms contracts it wonfrom Saudi Arabia in the early 1970s.    Northrop, seeking to sell F-5 fighter aircraft andsupporting services to Saudi Arabia, hired Khashoggi's firm in1970 as its marketing representative.    Northrop paid more than 17 mln dlrs in commissions toKhashoggi's firm, Triad International Marketing, from 1971 to1975. U.S. Defense Department records showed that Northrops'sales to Saudi Arabia during this period totaled 4.2 billiondlrs.

"It doesn't look as if there is going to be any improvementin the powdered soft drink sector," said Donna Smith, aMonsanto spokeswoman.    The company reported third quarter sales of 1.90 billiondlrs from 1.69 billion a year earlier. Nutrasweet sales fell to177 mln from 179 mln a year earlier, it said.    A growing market for diet sodas, about 90 pct of which useNutrasweet, offset much of the sales loss, said Monsanto chiefeconomist Nick Filippello.    Prospects remain strong in the diet soda market, Filippellosaid, since industry analysts predict diet carbonated softdrinks will hold about 28 pct of the soda market by year's end,up from 25 pct in 1986.    That market, coupled with increased usage of Nutrasweet insuch items as frozen desserts, should result in a 10 pctincrease in consumer consumption of the sweetener in 1987,Filippello said.    Monsanto spokeswoman Donna Smith refused to comment on thecompany's pricing policies for Nutrasweet.    However, Filippello said it was fair to assume thatMonsanto priced Nutrasweet at a lower rate for the diet sodamarket.    Nutrasweet sales have been falling since the fourth quarterof 1986 when medical studies raised questions about itspossible side effects, such as migraine headaches.    Monsanto acquired G.D.

reut2-021.sgm, TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS, The Louvre accord on currency stability,which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets sincelast February, appeared in serious danger today as atransatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came tothe boil, foreign exchange dealers said.    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock andbond markets plunged, officials in the major industrialcountries played down the dispute as a bilateral problembetween the United States and West Germany and insisted thatthe currency pact was still alive.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the marketfears when he attacked the rise in West German short-terminterest rates. "That's not in keeping with the spirit of whatwe agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,"Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He wasreferring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Groupof Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed thepact.    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who bothhave large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economicgrowth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvreagreement was still operative, the West German interest ratemove would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.    "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker thathe's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all betsare off in terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currencyanalyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguineview, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is apparentlyreacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Bakercomment will regret it later on."    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted theLouvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers torespond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for "a faithfuland firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to theLouvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the BritishTreasury commented on the row.    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despiteU.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this doesnot represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of theLouvre Accord."    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executiveof West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said thatfollowing recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.Was still committed to the accord.    In a move which the market interpreted as a possiblegesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-termliquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct onMonday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injectedmedium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France alsostepped into the French money market to hold down rates,injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates roseclose to eight pct. Reuter&#3;

reut2-021.sgm, SWEDEN'S BOLIDEN TO OPEN SAUDI ARABIAN GOLD MINE, Mining group Boliden AB said it hadagreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and MineralOrganisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia toexploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.    Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedishgroup would  be responsible for the technical side of theoperation and would have no control over the product itself.    He said one option under discussion for refining the goldore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter innorthern Sweden.    Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said itwas strategically important since it increased Boliden'spresence in Saudi Arabia.    "Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskaralready...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of thefuture," he said.    The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahabin the west of the country and should open in the first half of1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of goldsmelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.    Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in SaudiArabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine toopen in modern times.    "This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of miningtechnology and knowhow," said the group's chief executive, KjellNilsson. Reuter&#3;

reut2-021.sgm, UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET, British Sugar Plc was forced to shut itsIpswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acuteshortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to aReuter inquiry    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combinationof very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in thefactory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week'shurricane which blocked roads.    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads arecleared and supplies of beet build up again.    This is the first time in many years that a factory hasbeen closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by BritishSugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a yearout of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvestingproblems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintainingits estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, thespokesman said.    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factoriesnormally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during thecampaign.    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had beenharvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather hasseverely restricted beet lifting.    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yetavailable. Reuter&#3;

reut2-021.sgm, WEST GERMANY STILL COMMITTED TO LOUVRE ACCORD, West German government sources said Bonnremained committed to the Louvre Accord to stabilisecurrencies, which was struck by leading western democracies inParis last February.    Over the weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakercriticised recent rises in West German short-term interestrates and said such developments were not in the spirit of theLouvre pact. He said the agreement may have to be re-examined.    The sources said the West German interest rate rises had tobe seen in the context of interest rate developments worldwide. Reuter&#3;
reut2-021.sgm, U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - COMPANIES ON SIDELINES, The recent sharp rise in U.S. interestrates sparked turmoil in the fixed-income markets, butunderwriters said they doubt company treasurers will rush toborrow before rates increase further.    "Corporate treasurers will continue to issue new debt whenthey believe they are borrowing at an attractive rate," said anunderwriter with a major Wall Street house.    Said another, "We will not see a flood of new offerings.Treasurers are reassessing the market. We will not see newissuance dry up either."    Still, the pace of corporate borrowing in the publicfinance market has slowed, according to a Reuter tabulation.    Last week, which was shortened by the Columbus Day holiday,saw issuance of 1.3 billion dlrs of new debt. That was downfrom the prior week's tally of slightly more than two billiondlrs of new debt.    In contrast, a year ago it was not unusual to see thoseamounts of new offerings in a single day as companies tookadvantage of the then decline in interest rates to refinanceold, higher-cost debt or to expand operations via financings atlow, attractive rates, underwriters noted.    "Companies will conduct financings that they believe areessential," said an underwriter with a medium-sized Wall Streetfirm. "But we will not see much more than that until the marketstabilizes."    In the meantime, treasurers will probably prefer shorterterm issues, analysts said. For instance, of last week's nineissues, only one had a maturity of more than 10 years.    The other offerings had maturities of two to seven years,with most clustered in the two to three year area, according toa Reuter tabulation. That is because single-digit interestrates were had last week only among two-year securities.    "If people think that interest rates will continue to headhigher, then we could see treasurers rushing to market," said atrader with a medium-sized securities house.    "But if people think last week's sharp interest rate riseis a fluke, treasurers will sit back and wait for rates todecline before issuing new debt, hoping of course that they arenot missing the boat by doing so," she added.    Another impediment to new issuance is the lukewarmreception to new issues by institutional and retail investorsin recent weeks, traders pointed out. Many investors refrainedfrom buying because they believed rate would rise further.    "We saw a lot of buying interest last week, but people arenot yet willing to pull the trigger," a broker said. "Theywould rather wait and see if the recent rate increase can besustained."    Conflicting forecasts on the likely direction of interestrates did not help, analysts said. For instance, Henry Kaufman,chief economist with Salomon Brothers Inc, said in his weekly"Comments on Credit" that the yields of U.S. Treasury bondswould probably rise further because the marketplace expectsinflation to rise and the dollar to continue to decline.    In contrast, Standard and Poor's Corp said on Friday thatprices of debt securities in the fixed-income markets wouldrecover. The rating agency said neither the economy nor thedollar justify current high yields.    Meanwhile, the Chicago Board of Trade is slated to hold apress briefing on Tuesday in New York about its plans to list afutures contract based on a corporate bond index.    That follows last week's announcement by Commodity ExchangeInc, Comex, that it plans to list on October 29 a new futurescontract based on the investment-grade corporate bond index ofMoody's Investors Service Inc.

Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the studyaveraged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American HeartAssociation guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of allthe raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study containedless than six pct fat, the NPPC said.    Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as theestablished authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fatcontent for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.    Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairsfor the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancybetween the study and the USDA handbook.    "Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on informationthat has been accumulated over the past 30 years. Thestatistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of todaywhich is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,"Kline said.    The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categoriesfrom 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fatcontent of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops. Reuter&#3;
reut2-021.sgm, SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS, The Soviet Union outlined its economictargets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improvestandards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.    Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Sovietindustrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from aplanned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against aplanned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures theoutput of a country's goods and services.    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes ofgrain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscowproduced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedmachine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization isessential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively onworld markets.    "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires," saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987compared with the same period last year.    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase plannedfor the industry for the whole of 1988.    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recentmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended toa large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources," he said.    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet thatdefense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the samefigure as was announced last year.    Western governments view official Soviet estimates fordefense spending as highly understated, but say the real figureis hard to calculate because Soviet military industries areintertwined with the civilian economy.    Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spendingnext year on medical services, education, pensions and socialinsurance schemes. Reuter&#3;

Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administrationhad embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflectattention from the scandal in which the United States sold armsto Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.

CalFed is a 23.1 bln dlr diversified financial-servicescompany.    "Key factors leading to the company's higher earnings werecontinued strong loan volume, an increase in net interestincome and higher earnings from non-real estate sources," saidGeorge Rutland, president and chief executive officer of thefirm of CalFed Inc.    Net earnings in the third quarter of 1987 were 50 mln dlrs,a 3.1 pct gain over 48.5 mln in the same period last year. Theyincreased 3.9 pct in the first nine months of this yearcompared with last year, totalling 134.6 mln dlrs against 129.6mln.

CalFed said the savings and loan unit's loan originationswere unchanged in the third quarter of 1987 compared with lastyear at 1.8 billion dlrs. But for the first nine months of1987, they rose to 5.4 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion in 1996.

reut2-021.sgm, BANK PURCHASE SLOWS SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> NET, Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> saidgrowth in its third-quarter earnings was slowed by the purchaseof Rainier Bancorp and the suspension of interest payments onBrazilian and Ecuadorian loans that were placed on anon-accrual status earlier this year.    The bank said it earned 128.1 mln dlrs in the thirdquarter, up from 118.3 mln a year earlier. On a per-sharebasis, income was 1.16 dlrs a share, up from 1.09 dlrs.    The bank said non-recurring costs of 10.1 mln dlrsassociated with the acquisition of Rainier, a 9.5-billion-dlrSeattle-based concern, cut earnings per share by nine cents.    Security Pacific also said the suspension of interestpayments on the Brazilian and Ecuadorian debt reduced netincome by 8.1 mln dlrs, or seven cents a share.    Security Pacific completed its acquisition of Rainier onAugust 31. Security Pacific's results have been restated toreflect the "pooling-of-interests" acquisition.    "Our third-quarter performance was strong, clearlydemonstrating the stability and balance in our earningsstreams," said Richard Flamson, chairman and chief executiveofficer. "The addition of Rainier," he continued, "adds verysignificantly to the strength of our western banking network."    The inclusion of Orbanco and Arizona Bancwest earningsaffected comparison of most financial categories.    Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income was 602.4 mlndlrs, up from 538.6 mln. The suspension of interest payments onBrazilizan and Ecuadorian debt reduced net interest income by41.9 mln dlrs.    Non-interest income rose to 471.6 mln dlrs from 412.1 mln.    Third-quarter provision for credit losses was 89.6 mlndlrs, down 17.9 mln dlrs. As a percentage of average loans andlease financing, net credit losses were 0.68 pct, down from0.79 pct a year earlier.    Non-performing loans and leases were 2.038 billion dlrs atthe end of the quarter, or 3.96 pct of loans and leases, upfrom 1.377 billion a year ago.    Other non-interest expense, composed of staff and otherexpenses, was 757.6 mln dlrs, up from 616.2 mln. The riseincluded an increase in staff expenses to 379.7 mln dlrs from313.0 mln dlrs.    Excluding Orbanco and Arizona Bancwest, average loans grew11 pct. Real estate and international loan growth had thegreatest rises of 16 pct and 15 pct, respectively.    Shareholders equity was 3.486 billion dlrs at the end ofthe third quarter, up from 3.381 billion.

reut2-021.sgm, SWISS ANALYSTS SAY MOOD ON MARKETS PRECARIOUS, Today's sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks andmatching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but themood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securitiesanalysts and economists said.    Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the openingon enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street andthe threat of renewed currency instability.    "I have never experienced anything like this, and I've beenin the business for 20 years," said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head ofEuropean research at Union Bank of Switzerland.    The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetaryauthorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerpublicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetarypolicy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilisecurrencies was still working, but added: "On the other hand, wewill not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interestrates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the UnitedStates will raise rates."    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) inZurich said: "The situation is very dangerous. Statements by theU.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates."    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank'sfinancial research department, called the sell-off "overdone,"but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banksloosen their monetary policy.    "I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over," hesaid. "The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step inwith an easy money policy, or else there is going to be aneconomic catastrophe. They have to act quickly."    Wyttenbach said the "Black Monday" sell-off was clearlyexaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participationcertificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correctionwould come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investorsonly in time for tomorrow's market, when there could beanother, smaller selling wave.    "As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --then we'll get a strong movement upward," Wyttenbach said. Butthat may not come soon.    "People are simply worried that in America, where the markethas now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,"he said. "People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988."    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the currentproblems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. "We do not have amark problem, we have a dollar problem," he added, but said thebiggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. FederalReserve Board, Alan Greenspan.    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that thedollar might be too high in the medium term and that interestrates might have to rise. "As a central banker he shouldn't dothat," Wyttenbach said. "There is a danger that we will fall backinto the 1970s," he said. "We have a real crisis of confidence inGreenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker."    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: "I'm relatively optimisticbecause the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has tointervene."    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to takeany significant steps, adding that the focus of attentionremains on the United States.    "The panic started in New York, it has to end there."    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggestingthey not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while beforedeciding what to do.

reut2-021.sgm, SOVIET UNION SETS 4.5 PCT INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT GROWTH, Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin toldthe Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned torise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.    In the first nine months of this year, industrial outputrose by 3.6 pct.    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pctagainst a planned 4.1 pct this year.    He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.    The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected theharvest this year.    Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineeringindustry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedas a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if theSoviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets.    "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires," saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of thisyear against the same period of 1986. This is well below the7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recentmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended toa large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources," he said.    Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Sovietdefence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, thesame as announced last year.    Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increasespending next year on medical services, education, pensions andsocial insurance schemes    He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than hadoriginally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan.

The SPARC chip is based on reduced instruction-setcomputing, or RISC, technology.     ATT said the version of UNIX used by the new computer willincorporate po;ular features of the Berkeley 4.2 system, adirative of the UNIX system used widely in scientific andengineering markets, as well as features of SunOs, a variant ofthe Berkely system sold by Sun.    ATT said it would take 18 months to two years to developnew computers based on the Sun microchip and the merged versionof the UNIX operating system.    Vittorio Cassoni, president of ATT's newly-formed DataSystems Group, said the company will not offer the new machinesuntil the merged version of UNIX is completed.    "It's the software that will determine the availability ofproducts based on SPARC," he said.    Eventually ATT's entire line of 3B mini computers will beconverted to the SPARC architecture, Cassoni said.       The investment of all current users will be protected,meaning that they will be able to maintain the software used onthe current 3B line, he said.    Cassoni also said ATT's sales of computers declined in thefirst nine months of the year compared with the first ninemonths of last year.    The lower sales were primarily the result of ATT'stransition to a new line of computers, he said.    However, "demand for the new products is way, way aboveexpectation," he stated. Reuter&#3;

reut2-021.sgm, S.KOREA CURRENT A/C SURPLUS SEEN NEAR 10 BLN DLRS, South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billiondlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for thecountry's cheap cars and electronic goods.    Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny theYonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its ownfigures later in the week.    Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the currentaccount, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled7.03 billion dlrs.    This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for thewhole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks withthe International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapidrevaluation of the won against the dollar.    The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.    "Exports in October could be relatively modest due to manypublic holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus willbe well over nine billion dollars, close to ten," Yonhap said.    The sharp rise in the September surplus came from aresumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previousmonth.    More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrestbetween July and September.    The South Korean government originally targeted a fivebillion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raisethis to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half exportboom.    If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplusseemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the UnitedStates which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit withSeoul last year, government economists said.    The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressureat home, has called on South Korea to open more markets toAmerican goods and revalue the won faster.    The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year. REUTER&#3;

reut2-021.sgm, SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN, Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the keysupplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at leastthe next five years, oil industry sources said.    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane andbutane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on SaudiArabian LPG, the sources said.    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associateof crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. "Saudiis a reliable supplier in that sense," said one trader.    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as anLPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.    "Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulfcould easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilitiesin that area," said another trader.    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant atAl-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back tocontractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports fromother ports.    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on cruderather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPGsupply disruptions, traders said.    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz wasunlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatlyrise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at amoderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to liftslightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports fromIndonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases inlarge scale when Japan increases annual imports of IndonesianLPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in theyear ended March 1987, the sources said.    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase downterm purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes onthe spot market, they said.    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under termcontracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct ofJapan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has madesome concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in therecent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely theJapanese will accept the offer, the sources said.    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far beenunsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula toreplace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified byPetromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)of Arabian Light.    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftingsshould the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of ArabianLight's GSP.    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,the trade sources said.    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplyingup to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject toseller-buyer agreement.    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cutsupplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.    "If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitablebasis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct," saidan official at a major importer. "Freight costs are higher forcargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to alonger haul and war risk insurance payments."    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month tofinalise their separate contract talks, now focusing oncontractual period and volume, which could be very similar tocurrent levels, the sources said. "When we talk business, wewould seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability ofhigh dependence on a single supplier," said one. REUTER&#3;

On Monday, King Baudouin accepted the resignation ofBelgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' coalition and askedhim to try to form a new government.    Because of the crisis, Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA(BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourgfrancs, originally scheduled for the end of last week, BGLdirector Robert Sharfe said.    He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week.    It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interestrates on Luxembourg franc bond private placements, bankingsources said. However, no new placements are scheduled foranother 10 days.    The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp(SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct, whereas in previous issuesthe interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct.    Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc, which is in paritywith the Belgian franc, are strongly affected by Belgian rates.    On Friday, Belgium increased the rate on three-monthTreasury certificates by 0.5 pct to 7.15 pct as the Belgianfranc came under pressure.    Private placements in Luxembourg francs have becomeincreasingly popular, particularly with Scandivanian borrowers,because they carry a relatively low interest rate.    Private investors also have flocked to buy Luxembourg francbond issues because the franc was seen as a fairly strongcurrency. REUTER&#3;

Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt lastThursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs andinterest rates    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl'scriticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive placefor foreign investors.    "The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank andFinance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreigninvestors," said one economist for a London broker, who askednot to be identified.    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financialpolicy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship tosteer the economy through a particularly difficult time.    "There are plenty of objective pressures which will resultin things getting back to normal again after a period of illfeeling," said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pctwithholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds ina market already reeling from rising interest rates at home andabroad.    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way thefinance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting theBundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflictingdetails to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been underextraordinary pressures lately.    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by hisdeputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fightinflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he hadpursued so far this year to promote currency stability.    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more likeSchlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has beenwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supplygrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbankcouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent hisviews, bankers said.    "Poehl is in a minority in his own house," said Commerzbank'sPfister.    "Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is notentirely his own," said another economist.    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the markand hurting West German exporters.    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since theBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary JamesBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany tostimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a roundof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult forStoltenberg than he had bargained for.    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly votedmost popular government politician last year, had to faceresistance from local barons in the government coalitionparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising4.3 billion marks.    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it willpush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs thegovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political rowwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington lastmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state ofSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign afterallegations of a "dirty tricks" election campaign led to heavylosses for the CDU in state elections.    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva lastweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the moreremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, andwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier thisyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition governmentgave Poehl another eight-year term.    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said hehoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he wasnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating theBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said. REUTER&#3;

"Our country is walking on one leg now," said Ismail Salleh,an economist with the Institute of Strategic and InternationalStudies. "It has to depend on public sector investment forfaster growth if the private sector is not moving."    Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinkingone pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.    The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be undertwo pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pctbecause prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin andsemiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.    The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billionringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.    Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pctin 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.    Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmenblaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.    One businessman said too many politicians give theimpression that Malaysia was unstable.    "If we can take care of investment confidence, the potentialto recover strongly is great," a banker said.    Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in theblack with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgitsurplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.    The government has said its fiscal policies will balancethe budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.    The government will also repay some of its external debt,which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.    Political leaders have said the budget will not hurtordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essentialgoods are unlikely to change.    Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut thecorporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia tocompete for investors with neighbouring states. REUTER&#3;

The government's own proposal for an across-the-board dailypay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eightpesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year averagehigher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.    The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by theEmployers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).    The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflationrate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solitasaid. Both were proposed last month.    Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pctby the National Economic and Development Authority early thismonth.

reut2-021.sgm, LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS, The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nationsstill comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilizecurrencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at theweekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lowerrange for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank ofJapan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.    "The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, andanyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret itlater on," the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk thedollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, henoted.    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved inmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Wouldnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollaragainst the mark or the yen.    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and141.35 yen.    "Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higherinterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but thisdoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic frameworkof the Louvre accord," the Finance Ministry official said.    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid anyfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not onlyhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debtproblem.    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise theirinterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond marketsfurther, the monetary officials said.    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declinedto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a furtherdecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationaryexpectations in the U.S.    "That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvreagreement is still operative," the senior ministry officialsaid.    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday thatWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of WestGermany's increase in short-term interest rates.    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollardecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in theaccord, foreign exchange dealers said.    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additionalstatement that "the Louvre agreement is still operative," andthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, thedealers said.    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day inTokyo currency markets.    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguisedpressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rateshigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,or international economic policy coordination.    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other'seconomic policies and from time to time apply "peer pressure" topersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,they noted. "Without such a basic agreement of multilateralsurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West Germanpolicy so openly," the ministry official said.    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policyshould thus be regarded as a process of healthy policycoordination and not as any indication of a possible collapseof the Louvre agreement, the official said.    He also said Japan has not received any specific requestfrom the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-termmoney rates have been edging higher.

Norsk Data said in August it expected to show a pre-taxprofit of between 550 and 600 mln crowns this year.    The sales figure was lowered after it became clear sales inNorth America and India would not match earlier predictions,the company said in a statement, adding: "It is ... Doubtfulthat this discrepancy can be compensated by a correspondingextra increase in its European business."    The company said its sales in Europe remained strong,however, and were expected to grow by 25 to 35 pct in 1987.    Norsk Data in August dropped a planned issue of newnon-voting shares in the United States, Norway and othercountries because of unfavourable market conditions.    The move was seen by Oslo and London securities analysts asa sign the company's rapid growth years might be over.

reut2-021.sgm, ABE TIPPED TO BE NEXT JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER, No clear indication has emerged of thevictor in the race to succeed Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasonebut political analysts said it was becoming more likely thatformer foreign minister Shintaro Abe would be chosen.    A decision on which of the three contenders would be pickedwas expected late today or early on Tuesday, they said.    Japanese political leaders held a flurry of closed-doormeetings today and the three candidates called on Nakasone, whois due to step down late this month, to mediate to break thedeadlock.    The other candidates are Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawaand former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita.    They are vying for the post of president of the rulingLiberal Democratic Party (LDP), who is automatically primeminister by virtue of the party's parliamentary majority.    The new LDP president will be named formally at a partyconvention on October 30 and elected prime minister byparliament, probably on November 6, LDP sources said.    Nakasone, 69, is due to retire on October 31 after fiveyears in the post, an exceptionally long term by Japanesestandards.    Takeshita, who is head of the party's largest faction, hadsteadfastly opposed the idea of seeking Nakasone's help, but hetold reporters: "It is possible Nakasone will be given carteblanche (for selection of his successor)."    One political analyst, who declined to be identified, saidNakasone, despite a personal preference for Miyazawa, is likelyto choose Abe as the best candidate for steering Japan throughits international problems and maintaining party unity. Abealso would also accept Nakasone's influence, he said. Analystssaid one of Nakasone's prime aims is to retain as much power aspossible following his retirement.    Takeshita, the early favorite because of the size of hisfaction, is viewed by many politicians and analysts as beingunsuitable for the post of prime minister because of his lackof international experience.    The analysts said Nakasone also was very unlikely tosupport Takeshita's bid because of the differences in theirpolitical styles. REUTER&#3;

reut2-021.sgm, RUBBER STOCK MANAGER SAYS QUALITY ACCEPTABLE, International Rubber Organisation(INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests hadshown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, butacknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it.    "We have said all along that the rubber is holding up wellfrom a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored inproper conditions does not deteriorate," he told Reuters in atelephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber soldsince he entered the market in September would be discussed atan INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.    Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest inbuying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possiblepoor quality.    Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the"may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO'sfive-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stockwas uppermost in consumers' minds.    "We have received good interest for the rubber. I understandthe Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubberbefore they carry on buying," he said.    Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 differentlocations in producing and consuming nations, adding allwarehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.    Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during thepast week to 10 days and this could reflect a "wait and seeattitude" by buyers, he said.    "Consumers are holding back from buying additional amountsuntil they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,they are likely to buy more." Hofmeister said he could reducethe offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interestbut INRO did not want to depress prices artificially.    Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimatesthat he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpurand New York since September.    But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have anidea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overallhad put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.    The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonnebuffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Councilmeeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday.

reut2-021.sgm, ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR, An income tax surcharge and capitalgains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation ofthe N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and theBank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed torestore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut bycurrent government policies.    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turnwould lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 couldbe much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as apercentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase wasprobably unavoidable, Bayliss said.    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pctvalue-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationaryimpact of a currency depreciation.    The government had failed to bring inflation down despitelower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year toend-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflationpolicies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates andinsufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Baylisssaid. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debtand debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.    "The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems aregoing to take much longer to solve than was originally thoughtis soundly based -- primarily because the government'smacro-economic policies have been unsuccessful," Bayliss said.

reut2-021.sgm, COMPETITION TOUGHENS FOR NEAR-SUPERCOMPUTERS, An announcement by Alliant ComputerSystems Inc &lt;ALNT> of a new low-end near-supercomputer and &lt;ETASystems Inc>'s unveiling of a high-end machine in the samecategory show competition is stiff in this market, industryanalysts said.     Consultants said Alliant's new FX computer, aimed mainlyat scientists and researchers will be priced between 100,000and 200,000 dlrs and will be faster than anything else in thatprice range. But they said Alliant is trying to bring prices inline with discounts it now gives many of its customers.    "(The new FX) is significant to the extent that itrepresents Alliant's recognition of the reality of themarketplace," said a source who was briefed by Alliant on thenew computer. "The list price is more in line with what they areseeing anyway."    Near-supercomputers, often called mini-supercomputers,resemble the massive supercomputers favoured by scientists butare much less expensive and a quarter as powerful.    Supercomputers cost well over one mln dlrs butmini-supercomputers are generally priced between 200,000 dlrsand one mln dlrs.    Most near-supercomputers use a new computer architecturecalled parallel processing, in which a problem is broken upinto segments and each segment assigned to a differentprocessor. General-purpose mainframe computers have just oneprocessor that works on one segment of a problem at a time,making them too slow for complex scientific problems.    Near-supercomputers have been in existence for only aboutfive years and the two leading manufacturers, Alliant andConvex Computer Corp (CNVX), held two of the most successfulinitial public offerings last year.    But Alliant and Convex, a Texas company, are also facingsome 15 companies competing for between 200 and 250 mln dlrs insales this year, and the result has been lower prices andshrinking profit margins.    Heavy discounting, slow acceptance outside the scientificmarket, lack of software and too many competitors also havemade analysts reassess prospects for near-supercomputers.    Jeffrey Canin, computer analyst with Hambrecht and Quist,said he just added a year to his original growth estimates forthe industry. He now expects sales to reach 1.1 billion dlrs in1991, instead of 1990.    In recent weeks both Alliant and Convex have said theirthird quarter earnings would be reduced by "competitive pricingpressures."    Alliant said profits for the period will be about fivecents a share against eight cents last year, although revenuesfor the period rose to 14.2 mln dlrs from 8.6 mln.    Convex said third quarter earnings will be less than thesecond quarter's 12 cents a share while revenues will risealmost eight mln dlrs over the 1986 third quarter to between 18and 18.5 mln dlrs.    Until now, most of the price discounting occurred at thebottom of the product line in near-supercomputers, but ETASystem's announcement could start squeezing Convex and Alliantfrom the top, analysts said.    ETA, a subsidiary of Control Data Corp &lt;CDC>, introducedtwo machines that are really full-blown supercomputers similarto those sold by Cray Research Inc, the world's biggestsupercomputer maker, but at half the price of Cray's cheapestmodel. The ETA-10 Model P costs 995,000 dlrs and the Model Q is1.2 mln dlrs.    ETA officials told a news conference the new machines maybe classified as supercomputers but they are aimed directly atthe upper end of the product lines from Alliant and Convex.    Acceptance of ETA's product could be hampered by lack ofsoftware, analysts said, noting this is an issue that faces allparallel processor makers to some degree.    Because parallel processing is a new architecture that hasyet to be widely used, third party software vendors have beenslow to write programs for the near-supercomputers.    ETA, however, "offers a low priced entry into supercomputersfor some customers," one consultant said.    Canin cautioned that "the price pressures will continue forsome time" and estimated that five percentage points have beenknocked off the gross profit margins of both Convex and Alliantthis year by price discounting.    Next year, he said, the two companies will face a new setof problems as they both introduce their second generation ofproducts. "I am always cautious about the first major producttransition."

reut2-021.sgm, TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN, Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watchingnervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below thesignificant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.    "The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it isconsidered to be the lower end of the reference range. If thecurrency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,"said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichiKangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Fridaycloses of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New Yorkand 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.    "The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearishsentiment after Baker's comments," said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. Hesaid this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation amongthe group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement theLouvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-daydrop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weaknessin U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but hestrongly criticised West German moves to raise key interestrates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatiencewith some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accorddue to their fears of increasing inflation.    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationarypressures also slow domestic demand.    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings toboost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Tradedeficit, Tanaka said.    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a stillmassive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interestrates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.    "Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nationscoordinate dollar buying intervention," said Soichi Hirabayashi,deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchangedepartment.    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generallyconsidered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.    "The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the nearfuture and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nationsfailing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvreaccord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,"Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as lowas 135 yen soon. REUTER&#3;

reut2-021.sgm, SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987, The Soviet Union's industrial output isgrowing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign tradehas fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.    Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda showindustrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.    Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2pct.    Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billionroubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.    One factor affecting industrial growth was the introductionof a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Lastyear's calculations of industrial output included all goods,irrespective of quality.    Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, specialinspectors have the right to reject goods they consider belowstandard.    Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods wererejected in the nine-month period.    The figures also showed that on October 1, there were morethan 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.    The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of theeconomy has been an important part of the modernisationcampaign, with measures introduced recently to allow thesetting up of small shops on a private basis.    Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine monthsagainst 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.    But western economists said they treat Soviet productivityfigures with caution, as they are more broadly based than inthe West, which measures worker output over a given period.    Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Unionas of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same periodlast year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against194 roubles a year ago. REUTER&#3;
