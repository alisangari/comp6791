reut2-000.sgm, BAHIA COCOA REVIEW, Showers continued throughout the week inthe Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since earlyJanuary and improving prospects for the coming temporao,although normal humidity levels have not been restored,Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bagsof 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seemsthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in thearrivals figures.    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to howmuch old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting haspractically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimatesaround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln thereare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,middlemen, exporters and processors.    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fitfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties inobtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers havesold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment andonly limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports withJune/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrsunder New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrsper tonne FOB.    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/Julyat 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,Uruguay and open ports.    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs forMarch/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 timesNew York Dec for Oct/Dec.    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertiblecurrency areas.    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times NewYork July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New YorkSept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smithsaid.    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bagsagainst the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88crop.    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected tobe published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission aftercarnival which ends midday on February 27. Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER, BankAmerica Corp is not underpressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering andwould do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poorperformance, banking analysts said.    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delayits up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to beapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other bankingissues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest paymentson a large portion of its foreign debt.    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of theFirst Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica isunder no pressure to sell the securities into a market thatwill be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen asone of the major factors leading the First Interstatewithdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longerthan expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for FinancialCommunications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed withthe offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," saidLawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andSmith.    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer theyhave to show the market an improved financial outlook.    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types ofequities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertiblepreferred stock would encompass at least part of it.    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean alower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stockholders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.    Several analysts said that while they believe the Braziliandebt problem will continue to hang over the banking industrythrough the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely toease over the coming weeks.    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billiondlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if theinterest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mlndlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said JosephArsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not showup in the current quarter.    With other major banks standing to lose even more thanBankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analystssaid they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to wayMexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

reut2-000.sgm, BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT, Venezuela and its bank advisorycommittee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms ofa 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed lastFebruary, bankers said.    They declined to disclose details because two or threerepresentatives on the panel have still to obtain the approvalof their senior management for the new terms.    The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon andcould put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,the bankers said.    "A number of details have still to be finalized, but thebroad details of the new amortization schedules and interestrates are in place," one senior banker said.    The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easierterms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.    It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was dueto make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request thatit make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -and sought a commitment from the banks to finance newinvestment in Venezuela.    The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have beengoing on intermittently for several months, follows theannouncement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debtrescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.    And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.    While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successesafter the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension lastFriday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce theincentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil. Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND, The Tower Commission report, whichsays President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran armsdeal, just about ends his prospects of regaining politicaldominance in Washington, political analysts said.    "This is certification of incompetence," private politicalanalyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Towerreport made public today.    "It's as if he went before a professional licensing boardand was denied credentials."    In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman JohnTower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republicansenator from Texas, told a press conference, "The presidentclearly did not understand the nature of this operation."    The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion inWashington that Reagan is not in full command of thegovernment, was particularly damaging because it was preparedby a board of the Republican president's own choosing.    The three-member panel made up of Tower, former NationalSecurity Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of StateEdmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticismfrom a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.    "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republicanpolitical strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, wewon't do it again'?"    The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, saidthe report was like "an anvil falling on us."    Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy studygroup, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes ofregaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress,the press and the Washington bureaucracy.    The report may also undermine the standing of DefenseSecretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State GeorgeShultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keepingtheir own skirts clean than supporting the president.    "They protected the record as to their own positions on thisissue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect thepresident from the consequences," it said.    White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former CentralIntelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strongcriticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.    Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savagedfor allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iraninitiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.    Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerousbrain tumor in December, had already resigned for healthreasons last month.    "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short ofbeing heroes," Tower told reporters.    While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,including command of the armed forces and the right to vetolegislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him toretake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularlywith Congress controlled by the Democrats.    The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether theman in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.    Although his job approval rating has fallen as much astwenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the armsdeal with Iran became public last November, his personalpopularity is still relatively high.    A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showedthat just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was incontrol of the government, but 55 pct still thought he wasdoing a good job as president.    American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, aDemocrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington powerbrokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.    "In the past, he has been able to go around the power eliteby appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.    Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televisedaddress next week.    But one top Republican strategist warned against expectinga dramatic turnaround.    "The White House has to avoid building expectations thatcannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity."They have to recognize there is no quick fix."    Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularityhas not always translated into public backing for his policies.    They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November'selections when voters rejected his appeals and restored controlof the Senate to the Democrats. Reuter&#3;

The company's board held a regularlyscheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Managementannouncement. She said a statement was expected but it was notcertain when it would be ready.     She was unable to say if there had been any prior contactbetween Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.

Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tenderoffers for any and all shares for cash.

Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates hadcatapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 butthe stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in thefourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share forthe full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.

reut2-000.sgm, BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY, inflationplan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of theeconomy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaringprices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed thevalue of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespreadindexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250pct inflation rate.    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.    "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there wasinflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bankeconomist said.    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by adramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient tocover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlrforeign debt.    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be ontarget for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging onebillion dlrs.

reut2-000.sgm, U.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN, A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. Januarydurable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spendingthat could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economyin the first quarter of 1987, economists said.    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the reportpainted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.    But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be aprimary factor behind the drop in orders for business capitalinvestment.    "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said DavidWyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because itmay be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely totax reform than we thought."    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pctdecline in new orders for machinery was led by declines inoffice and computing equipment orders.    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been aresponse to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and theend of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.    "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, sopeople just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforcedthe view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,economists said.    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December'sincreased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported0.9 pct.    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was causedby more than tax reform.    "The wash-out that took place in January was far greaterthan the actual gains that took place in November andDecember," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Theeconomy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."    "The report definitely points to very sluggish capitalspending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maudeof Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs asevidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. InNovember, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December theyfell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.    "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, whichmay quickly translate to a drop in production," MidlandMontagu's Maude said.    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made ofJanuary's report, given that other reports have reflectedstrength.    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline inDecember.    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in Januaryshipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.    "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed totighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.    "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numberslike this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "Peoplearen't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed willhave to ease to ensure global growth."

reut2-000.sgm, KEY U.S. TAX WRITERS SEEK ESTATE TAX CURBS, The chairmen and senior Republicanmembers of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposedlegislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock toan employee stock ownership plan.    The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billiondlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.    If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactionsafter Sept 26, 1987.    The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn),Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and SenBob Packwood (R-Ore).    In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deductionenacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broadand would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over fouryears. The narrower deduction would cost the government lessthan 300 mln dlrs for the same years.    He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions whichallowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in astatement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allowsmany wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate taxentirely when they die."    He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estatesto sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way ofpromoting worker ownership; however, the provision was notmeant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much asis currently estimated."

reut2-000.sgm, QUEBECOR &lt;PQB> HEAD SEES NEW VENTURES LIKELY, Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largestpublishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a newdaily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, presidentPierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.    The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebecgovernment's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company &lt;DonohueInc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new papermill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.    "I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... Thisis not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that heplans to announce a decision early next week.    Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs lastyear and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three dailynewspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, thesecond-largest circulation paper in Canada.    A new daily would give Montreal its second English-language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the citythe most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in NorthAmerica, analysts have said.    Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new Englishlanguage tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within sixmonths. He said he is waiting to determine whether the newventure would have the support of major advertisers.    Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads oftwo major Canadian companies who are interested in the projectbut has not decided whether he would take partners in thenewspaper venture.    He said he would consider launching the newspaper with oneof the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.    "It would be the possibility of doing something else in theshort term," Peladeau said.    Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with RobertMaxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc &lt;BPCL.L>does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.    Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stakein Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of thegovvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and Britishprinting acquiring the other 49 pct.    "In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage ofnewsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper toprint the paper," Peladeau said. "When I lived that, I said tomyself...next time we'll be ready."    Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprintcapacity however, is already committed to other buyers.    Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a yearand Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirrornewspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.    Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies willhave to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or buildanother mill to meet their demands .    He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint orother types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could beon stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressedarea with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by thegovernment.    Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventureswith Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market inFrance or in the U.S., where the company owns two largeprinting plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.    He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, wouldprovide an entree into the French market, where foreigners areprevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he wouldconsider either buying into or starting daily newspapers inFrance or the U.S.    Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain ofabout 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition oftwo groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiatingthe acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada,Peladeau said.    He said the company may consider starting daily newspapersin two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in theprovince.    Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in itslisting on the American stock exchange for a New York StockExchange listing. Reuter&#3;

The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report received inLondon, said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched intoIraq on January 9 was now over.    It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army andRevolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had"dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in thehistory of the Iraq-imposed war."    The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared toherald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra insouthern Iraq.    "The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdadgovernment was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistancepower of its army...," said the statement quoted by IRNA.    It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensiveand called on supporters of Baghdad to "come to their senses" anddiscontinue support for what it called the tottering regime inIraq.    Iran said its forces had "liberated" 155 square kilometers ofenemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and takenover islands, townships, rivers and part of a road leading intoBasra.    The Iranian forces "are in full control of these areas," thestatement said.    It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totallydestroyed, along with 700 tanks and 1,500 other vehicles. Thevictory list also included 80 warplanes downed, 250 anti-aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed andthe seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS, U.S. bank discount window borrowingsless extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week toWednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrsat 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-weekstatement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451mln dlrs.    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing thatthere were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserveprojections in the week to Wednesday.    He said that natural float had been "acting a bitstrangely" for this time of year, noting that there had beenpoor weather during the latest week.    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, tonearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's highfloat, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday'sfloat figure was due to holdover and transportation float attwo widely separated Fed districts.    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as ofadjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections forunrelated cash letter errors in six districts around thecountry.    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, twodifferent clearing banks had system problems and the securitiesand Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or2100 EST on both days.    However, he said that both problems were cleared up duringboth afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserveimpact.    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discountwindow borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pctby the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regionalinstitutions.    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for bythe money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and15 pct by the smallest banks.    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excessreserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit onFriday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily averagedeficit for the week as a whole.    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively highexcess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were atthe smallest banks. Reuter&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF, American Express Co remained silent onmarket rumors it would spinoff all or part of its ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may beconsidering such a move because it is unhappy with the marketvalue of its stock.    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as themarket calculated a partially public Shearson may command agood market value, thereby boosting the total value of AmericanExpress. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financialservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.    American Express would not comment on the rumors or itsstock activity.    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcementyesterday of management changes.    At the meeting, company officials said American Expressstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performanceof Shearson, according to analysts.    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chiefoperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position ofpresident, which had been vacant. It also created four newpositions for chairmen of its operating divisions.    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make mostsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a totalspinoff.    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff ofShearson would be good since it is a strong profit center forAmerican Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings lastyear.    "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express isgoing to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.He questioned what would be a better investment than "a veryprofitable securities firm."    Several analysts said American Express is not in need ofcash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strongasset.    But others believe the company could very well ofconsidered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and onerumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said hebelieves American Express could have considered a partialspinoff in the past.    "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched abig premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is inthe 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place wouldprobably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of marketcapitalization," said Eckenfelder.    Some analysts said American Express could use capital sinceit plans to expand globally.    "They have enormous internal growth plans that takescapital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations toenhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down theroad," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.    "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavilyin the future, which goes heavily into the internationalarena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions anddivestitures along the way," he said.    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to thebrokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock mightbetter reflect other assets, such as the travel relatedservices business.    "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposureto brokerage. The value of the other components could command ahigher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage ofthe total operating earnings of the company," he said.     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-taxoperating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.    Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH, A study on grain certificates due outshortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could showthat certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more thancash outlays, administration and industry sources said.    Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the AgricultureDepartment and the Office of Management and Budget suggeststhat certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO officialtold Reuters.    GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specificrequest of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of thesenate agriculture committee.    The report, which will focus on the cost of certificatescompared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends onthe program's impact on the USDA loan program.    If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loanentries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost ofthe program would go up. However, if it is determined thatcertificates have caused the government grain stockpile todecrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificatesprogram should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.    But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fireagainst certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increasein the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said.    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,while USDA remains firmly committed to it. Reuter&#3;

He declined to comment on meetings this week in new yorkbetween public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's13-bank advisory committee except to say, "they areprogressing."    Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil'sdecision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiateaccording to its own interest.    Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditorstoday, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct overlibor, azpurua said only, "that is good news."    According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer tovenezuela is also a one pct margin as against the lastfebruary's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pctVenezuela wants.    Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated withthe banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal paymentsdue in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repaymentschedule, and debt capitalization schemes.    Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs inpublic and private debt principal this year. It was due toamortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector.    He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay noprincipal on restructured debt this year, but is now insistingthat if it makes payments they be compensated by new bankloans.    The banking sources said the committee has been prepared tolower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but thatno direct commitment was likely on new loans.    "debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility andthere will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow offinancing is guaranteed," azpurua said.    However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelanproposals for a direct link between oil income and debtpayments, "because circumstances change too quickly."    At the same time, he said the government is presentlystudying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and privatesector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries.The rules would be published by the finance ministry and thecentral bank.

reut2-000.sgm, OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS, OPEC may be forced to meet before ascheduled June session to readdress its production cuttingagreement if the organization wants to halt the current slidein oil prices, oil industry analysts said.    "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easyas OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort outthe problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates, CERA.    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPECfaces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.    "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a productionissue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oilanalyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and itsability to keep production under control have given way to apessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon ifit wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.    But some other analysts were uncertain that even anemergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC productionabove the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot havedeemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said theregional manager for one of the major oil companies who spokeon condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying toteach them that lesson again," he added.    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPECto meet before June, although not immediately. However, he isnot optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.    "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of thewinter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and Aprilwhen demand slackens," Mizrahi said.    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything morethan reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical forOPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.    "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weekssince buyers will come back into the market then," said DillardSpriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energyand Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oilhas been rising through the first quarter and this may haveprompted excesses in its production.    "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpdand is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what weare seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting thisdemand through current production," he told Reuters in atelephone interview.

Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep angerand frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral movelast Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrsof short-term trade and interbank lines.    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreigndebt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibankexecutive William Rhodes and representatives from committeevice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,told the banks that the government was preparing a telex toexplain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.

reut2-000.sgm, LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987, Liquefied natural gas imports fromAlgeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though itseconomically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.    Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerianstate petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview inAlgiers that such imports would be made this year.    "Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government andthe time required to restart mothballed terminals will delaythe import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gasanalyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.    Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its formercustomers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiaryof Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officialstold Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of BurlingtonNorthern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.    Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG werefeasible. "On a marginal cost basis, the companies that havemade capital investment to handle LNG import can operateprofitably even in the current price environment,"  FrankSpadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.   Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian importson U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trendhigher by the end of 1987.    A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf ofMexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firmprices, Shearson's Tulis said.   In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source ofsupplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.    Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.    Company sources also said that any negotiations withAlgeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relatevolumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot marketvalues. Reuter&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, U.S. FARM CREDIT RESCUE BILL SEEN BEFORE EASTER, The chairman of the Senate Agriculturesubcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farmcredit rescue package by Easter even if the system and itsregulator do not ask for help by then.    "We're going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you,before the Easter recess," Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said.    Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wantsrecommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, whenCongress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said.    Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), thesystem's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid.    Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA,as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted allits capital and needs federal government help.    However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of thesystem's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action,he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this yearand perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member ofthe three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed.    But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certifyaid is needed, it should request help informally.    "We all know we need a capital infusion," Boren said.    Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on theplight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, BrentBeesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Councilrepresenting the system, said that at the end of 1986 thesystem had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remainingafter losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.    While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicatedthe situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.    "A significant number of banks and associations in the mosteconomically depressed areas have and will continue to sufferextraordinary losses," Beesley said.    Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, saidthe troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of someone billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repayloans.    The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs bythe end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.    FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bondsin the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylorsuggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.    "The bondholders have no worry at this time," Billingtonsaid.    Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm creditsystem are circulating. The proposals range from consolidationof the system into a centralized national lender, tode-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.    But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious aboutproposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Thoseproposals would package farm loans for resale to investors.    Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outsidethe farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley saida secondary market with the farm credit system as its agentcould be developed without Congressional legislation. Reuter&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, REPORT COULD BE FINAL BLOW FOR REGAN, The Tower Commission's scathing   comments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff DonaldRegan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure,but the impact of its strong criticism on two other topofficials was less clear.    Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling ofReagan's worst political crisis since details of the covertarms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguanrebels first emerged last November.    But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State GeorgeShultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said theyopposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had beenmuted until the release of the Tower Commission report.    "Their obligation was to give the president their fullsupport and continued advice with respect to the program or, ifthey could not in conscience do that, to so inform thepresident," the report said after a three-month probe.    "Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program.They protected the record as to their own positions on thisissue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect thepresident from the consequences of his personal commitment tofreeing the hostages."    The report saved some of its most scathing language forRegan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personalfriend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White Houseangered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps moreimportantly, Reagan's wife Nancy.    "More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, heasserted personal control over the White House staff and soughtto extend this control to the national security adviser," saidthe report.    Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared tobe only a matter of timing. Many expected the president toannounce it when he addresses the nation on the TowerCommission's findings next week.    With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexterand other key figures in the scandal already out of office, thereport's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turnthe spotlight on their future.

reut2-000.sgm, SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS, Switzerland's economy, combining lowunemployment, financial stability and a large external paymentssurplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactoryfuture, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment, OECD, said.    This reflected the success of stable and relatively tightfiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, itsaid.    The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked outsome signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up ininflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.    The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Productgrowth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct afterlast year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.    But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modestincrease in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rateunchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrialnation OECD area.    Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs tothe dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pctrise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pctrespectively in 1986.    The faster growth of imports compared with exports thisyear and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meantthat the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDPwould shrink in both years.    But "given Switzerland's large external surplus, thereshould be no concern if domestic demand grows faster thanGDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute toimproving international balances," the OECD said.    Real private consumption appeared to have been unusuallybuoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after severalyears of relative weakness, it noted.    In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhatto a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overallGDP, it added.    The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remainedbright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levelslast year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisationin both the industry and service sectors, it said.    As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipmentinvestment is likely to decelerate only slightly this yearafter vigorous growth in 1986.    But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects fortourism and the banking industry, two major service sectorearners of foreign exchange.    The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and theaccelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, couldlead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.    Particularly for the banks, "recent developments ininternational financial markets give rise to the questionwhether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantialflexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speedrequired ... To preserve its competitive position," it said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT, The U.S. Agriculture Department is notactively considering offering subsidized wheat to the SovietUnion under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDAofficials said.    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has notbeen ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not inthe very near future.    "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But therejust isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confidentthan USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to theSoviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offerwhen they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlierthis week.    But administration and private sources agreed that if theReagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat toMoscow, it could take several months.    "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through anyinteragency process," the aide to Lyng said.    "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"said one former USDA official, who noted that theadministration took three months to decide in favor of sellingChina wheat under the subsidy program.    An official representing a large grain trade company saiddeliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members ofCongress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheatsubsidy offer to the Soviets.    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit toCapitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press thesecretary on the subsidy question a single time.    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked toclear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officialsat the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed theadministration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about anynew initiative. One USDA official who took part in theconsultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm,basic, factual economics."    Another USDA official said there was "not even an informalsuggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to theirpledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they weregranted more favorable terms.    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of anEEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would bedelayed because of disarray within the White House stemmingfrom the Iran arms affair.

reut2-000.sgm, U.S. TREASURY PART OF ARGENTINE BRIDGE LOAN, The U.S. Treasury said it was willingto participate with several other industrial countries inproviding a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina.    The Treasury announcecement did not name the othercountries nor the amount of financing the United States waswilling to supply.    Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesdaynight and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15billion dlrs in new loans and other financing.    "Our willingness to participate in this multilateralshort-term financing indicates our support for Argentina'seconomic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viablebalance of payments position," the Treassury statement said.    In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, Argentineofficials said the country needed "a more serene climate" tocarry out structural changes in the economy.    But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on itsforeign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week.    The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing forArgentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.    The one-page statement noted the International MonetaryFund expressed confidence in Argentina's economic policies andprospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement forit on February 18.    "Argentina is expected to qualify for IMFbalance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina torepay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementationof its economic program," the statement said.    The latest Argentine action marked the second time in lessthan two years its government has used a wage and price freezeto restrain inflation.    The debt talks in New York are being headed by ArgentineFinance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last forseveral days.    Along with new financing, Argentina reportedly wants lowerinterest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreigndebt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some ofthe money is loaned in Argentina.

The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that thedrug caused birth defects.    Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trialsinvolving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany.    It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company wereobtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about1,150 plaintiffs.    In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of theplaintiffs. In one, it said, the trial judge overruled thejury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the companyand a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned thetrial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing ofthis case by the full Court of Appeals.    Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and inthe other the jury was unable to reach a verdict.

Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island,N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part inevacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.    They had claimed the region was too populated for any safeevacuation plan, holding up the NRC's authority to issue fullpower licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants.

reut2-000.sgm, FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT, The sharp decline in soybean crush ratiosseen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, haspushed margins below the cost of production at most soybeanprocessing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybeanmeal and oil.    The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by theNational Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen overthe past two months when crush margins surged to the bestlevels seen in over a year.    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushedsoybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in theweekly crush number.    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surgein shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the nextfew months.    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feeddemand is very light for this time of year due to the milderthan normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices inan attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recentweeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in thenearby March contract today.    "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and soldMay, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crushtrader said.    "But they've been bailing out this week because the Marchhas been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if nottomorrow, then later in the month," he added.    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crushratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents perbushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last twodays.    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so noprocessors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitablelevel, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cutback production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.    With futures down, processors are finding they must bidpremiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 centsfor every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, downsharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and belowthe average cost of production, cash dealers said.    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, withlittle talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. Butprocessors will start halting production in the next few weeksit they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added. Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY, Latest Federal Reserve data suggest thatthe central bank voted to maintain the existing degree ofpressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-makingmeeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.    "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think wecan take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing hadchanged," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committeelast Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up totoday."    Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed mostfears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip onreserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wantedconfirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which coveredthe two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.    This need for additional reassurance was made all the moreacute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves fromthe banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchaseagreements for the first time since April of last year,economists added.    Today's data showed that the draining action was for afairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.    "The one thing that caught my eye were the relativelysizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson ofFirst National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearlyjustified need for them. There was nothing ominous."    "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the newstatement period today. If it had, it would have missed its(reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon.    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no largesingle-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discountwindow, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, thedaily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from160 in the prior period.    "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday andWednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," saidScott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesdayaverage rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.    Lending further support to the stable policy view was arelatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in thelatest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves inthe banking system, economists said.    "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck ofFirst Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."    "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billiondlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reservesaveraged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statementperiod, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.    After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth rangeto the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, littleattention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billiondlr jump in the week ended February 16.    Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread afine line between the dollar's progress in the internationalcurrency markets and the development of the domestic economy.    "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect onFed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it willtake the dollar into account in future policy decisions but ifthe economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing." Reuter&#3;

He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to tryto devise a way to collect purchasing information in order tomonitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders.    The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that"statistics support the perception in the United States thatAmerican auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the innercircles of Japan's auto companies and their traditionalsuppliers."    It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost fivebillion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985, U.S.firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market. reuter&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES, France's right wing government is facinggrowing pressure to modify its economic policies after revisingdown its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflationforecasts for this year.    Moving reluctantly into line with most private sectorforecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflationestimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut itseconomic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget lastseptember.    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figureswould not push the government off its chosen mix of pricederegulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.    But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they wouldpush to protect the purchasing power of their members, raisingthe spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.    And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believedPrime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growthand rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidentialelections due by April 1988.    "The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,"said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. "We have theimpression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growththis year."    "The big question is whether the government's policy of wagemoderation will be maintained," he added.    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for risesjustified by increased productivity.    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, EdmondMaire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands alreadyrejected by the government for indexation clauses to be builtinto future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higherprices.    Calling the government's policies "unbalanced and unjust," healso demanded investment incentives to boost employment. Heannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him thegovernment would spend two billion francs on a series ofmeasures to boost employment and training    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderateForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chiracearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest ofFrance's unions, declared the defence of its members earningsits top priority.    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, andstill rising, government supporters and some economic analystssaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.    "Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialistgovernment and I dont think this administration is going toreverse that," commented Michel Develle, economist atrecently-privatised Banque Paribas.    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmasand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higherinflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, hesaid.    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even morethan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.    "But that would still be an exceptional achievementconsidering that for the first time since the Second World Warall french prices have been freed," he commented.    Finance Ministry officials said that the governmentsabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsiblefor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January livingcosts.    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that shouldhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so longas the government kept wages under control.    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally morethan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,he added.    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be tohelp the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budgetdeficit, several analysts said.    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher ValueAdded Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset aloss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower thanexpected growth, they said.

reut2-000.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN EYEING FOREIGN STOCKS, Japanese life insurers, trust banks andcorporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bondmarket in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in theU.S., Britain, France and Hong Kong, fund managers said.    After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years,Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much onsimilar types of investments, they said.    Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year maydouble or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said.    Matsumoto, who manages Nikko's investment research andstrategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors beganpoking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year,but few made firm commitments until December when net purchasessuddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in eachof the previous five months.    Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added.    This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to drawthe widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pctof funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said.    "The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, firstbecause of its size and next because it has been successfulover the last couple of years," said Eugene Atkinson, managingdirector of Goldman Sachs International Corp.    Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity,enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money inand out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added.    However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling.They will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said.    Institutions, particularly life insurance companies whichconcentrate on income rather than capital gains to coverpayouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S.Treasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse,manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixedincome activities.    There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-terminvestors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to asignificant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because theliquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive, he added.    Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S.Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S.Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months.    Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reportsof significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations,he added.    Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life InsuranceCo told an economic conference that insurance companies, whichare responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreignsecurities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries andintend to diversify into other instruments and currencies.    Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of theirfunds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, WestGermany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said.    Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocksrelatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of thestrength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected tooffset currency risks, he added.    One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pctannual return on overseas investments but the recent decline inU.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fundinvestment stategies.    The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and Europeanbonds, he said.    Japanese investments in British equities have alreadyturned active and the pace is likely to increase, said AndrewSheaf, general manager of international equity activities atCounty Securities Japan.    "Last week was the busiest week we had," he said.    Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits ofBritish companies and the recent deregulation of governmentcontrolled firms, fund managers said.    Deregulation in France is also attracting Japaneseinterest, but stock investments there will be inhibited byworries about the French franc, they said.    Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term andspeculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-termpolitical stability, they added.    Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany,particularly as German firms, like their Japanese counterparts,are concerned about the recent dollar fall.    Australia also poses some risks due to currency values,they added. REUTER&#3;

They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust FundBureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits withthe bureau.    The bureau channels funds to government financialinstitutions for public works and other official uses, theysaid.    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the JapanDevelopment Bank, People's Finance Corp and the financecorporations of local public enterprises usually moves intandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust FundBureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce amarket-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate thedomestic economy, they said.    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cuttheir prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositorsusing the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts andTelecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity ofthe Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.    These ministries are trying to determine which market ratesshould be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,the ministry sources said.

reut2-000.sgm, AUSTRALIA'S KEATING CHANGES ECONOMIC FORECASTS, Domestic demand is now expected to makeno contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for allof the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.    However, he did not say in his speech to the EconomicPlanning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct risein gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.    But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly thisfinancial year and net export growth will provide the totalsource of gdp growth.    The August budget had forecast domestic demand wouldcontribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.    Keating said the overall impact of the changed economicparameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to aslightly more rapid correction in the current account deficitthan first anticipated.    "The government initially forecast a current account deficitfor 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is thatthe result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion," he said.    Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPACin December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy isbroadly on track, Keating said.    "They indicate that domestic demand has been a little moresluggish than was expected at budget time," he said.    "On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by morethan expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growthin domestic production and employment."    Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflationrate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.    "Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing ininflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetaryeffects wane," he said.    Keating said the government expects economic growth to pickup moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise innet exports and a very moderate but positive contribution fromprivate domestic demand.    He said domestic demand growth will be due to astrengthening in real household disposable income.    The moderate rise in economic growth next financial yearshould be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a levelbroadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.    "The current account deficit will continue to showimprovement in 1987/88," Keating said.    "As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recentyears recede further, and given continued effective wagerestraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88," hesaid. REUTER&#3;

Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eightproducing countries was not represented in a contact group offive producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates whichwas set up to facilitate debate.    The big producers "want to have the ball only in their courtand it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante ofCosta Rica said.    The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotasApril 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quotashares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas beforeSeptember 30, delegates said.    Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazilto retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the exportmarket, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesiasix pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.    But consuming countries and the dissident producer grouphave tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determinedby availability, using a formula incorporating exportableproduction and stocks statistics.    Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share andColombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quotadistribution scheme into effect now rather than later.    Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposalthat would reduce its quota share, delegates said.    Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement ona quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," evenadjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.    If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on thesupermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as aresult, industry sources said.    Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained aboutsteady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so anupswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either,they said.

reut2-000.sgm, INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW, Indonesia"s agriculture sector will growby just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pctin 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates ordeclines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast tofall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report onIndonesia"s agricultural performance.    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in1987.    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mlntonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because ofa drawdown on stocks.    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain," the report says.    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels."    Constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines.    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields.    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are nowresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, moreresistant rice types.    The government is depending on increased production ofexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood andpalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crudeoil prices.    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pctin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports risingto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, thereport says.    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) willrise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports willalso rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybeanmeal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of lastSeptember"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a risein domestic demand.    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economicperformance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slightnegative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pctin 1984.    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsiblefor the slump. REUTER&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS, Kuwait"s Oil Minister, in remarkspublished today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPECmeeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in worldoil prices.    Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the localdaily al-Qabas as saying: "None of the OPEC members has askedfor such a meeting."    He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed productionlimits of the 13-nation organisation.    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimateOPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mlnbpd agreed in Geneva last December.    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along withthe much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing abovequota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.    "This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which saidKuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose thatbecause Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the ministersaid.    Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability toproduce up to 4.0 mln bpd.    "If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing theirshare, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said.    He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpdof its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resistingofficial prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a markerof 18 dlrs per barrel.    Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levelsthis year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of19 dollars a barrel.    Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any internationaloil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."    Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs abarrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.    However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil becauseof its local and international refining facilities and its owndistribution network abroad, he added.    He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC"sdifferentials committee has been postponed until the start ofApril at the request of certain of the body"s members.    Ecuador"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite saidlast Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assigna lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this attalks this month of opec"s pricing committee.    Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, inapparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: "Weexpected such pressure. It will continue through March andApril." But he expected the situation would later improve. REUTER&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE, Indonesia appears to be nearing apolitical crossroads over measures to deregulate its protectedeconomy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.    To counter falling oil revenues, the government haslaunched a series of measures over the past nine months toboost exports outside the oil sector and attract newinvestment.    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leadingprimary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"sfall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue itscurrency by 31 pct in September.    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"sgovernment appears to be divided over what direction to leadthe economy.    "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard toderegulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,"the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agriculturalsector, but also reviews the country"s general economicperformance.    It says that while many government officials and advisersare recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strongpressures being exerted to halt all such moves."    "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,"the report says.    Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the WorldBank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics andsteel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.    Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced traderestrictions and liberalised imports.    The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986was probably about zero, and the economy may even havecontracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s," the report notes.    Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with apopulation of 168 million, is facing general elections inApril.    But the report hold out little hope for swift improvementin the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to aslightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economicactivity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in exportearnings from the petroleum industry."    "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weakdomestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, realdeclines in construction and trade, and a reduced level ofgrowth in agriculture," the report states.    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms iscrucial for the government to get the international lending itsneeds.    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balanceof payments support was given partly to help the governmentmaintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, INDIAN BUDGET COMES IN FOR WIDE CRITICISM, Opposition politicians, businessmenand newspapers criticised India"s newly unveiled 1987/88 budgetand large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees.    They said the budget failed to provide incentives foreconomic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform.    But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp risein defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation whereplaying on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved avote winner. The Indian Express, the country"s biggest sellingpaper, said: "The defence cow has never been holier."    The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget "shamelesslypolitical." It said in a front page commentary the "budget is badfor growth, bad for prices, bad for the stock market andneutral in respect of everything else."    Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had donelittle for them.    Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation andeducation outlays but he ordered a hold-down on currentexpenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. Hetold ministries to curb spending and promised a review ofmoney-losing public sector industries.    Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts butotherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisationpolicy launched two years ago.    Reaction in Bombay, India"s business capital, was generallyunfavourable.    Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposalsfor closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boostindustrial investment and productivity needed to lift realeconomic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the1985-90 development plan.    Nalin Vissanji, President of the Indian Merchants Chambersof Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capitalmarket and had not fulfilled a government pledge to removesurtax on corporate income.    Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange, India"s biggest, fellin a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi"sproposal to set up a regulatory board for the securitiesindustry.    The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals andtrading was suspended several times.    Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change incapital gains tax on stock sales.    Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead ofthree years without incurring capital gains tax.

He did not give details but said, "It is a very usefulalternative and in the end will permit the banks to say thatthey achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit thePhilippines to say exactly the same thing."    Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to thecountry's 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said thedebt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.    It said the certificates will be classified as zero-couponbonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at aconsiderable discount from their redemption price.    It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to aguaranteed return on both interest and principal since nopayment of any kind is made until the bond matures.    It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bondmarket for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.    The documents said peso proceeds can be invested inselected industries under the Philippines' debt/equity program.    Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates(LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.

The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyalsin the last published budget for 1985/86.    In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister SheikhAbdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected tospend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.    Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6billion riyals.    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86projected revenue of 9.7 billion.    The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due touncertainty surrounding oil revenues.    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the governmentdecided to limit recurrent expenditure each month toone-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15pct.    He urged heads of government departments and publicinstitutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. Hedid not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed onthe country's foreign reserves.

reut2-000.sgm, GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS, Gulf money markets have grown reasonablywell during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remainto a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;GulfInternational Bank BSC> (GIB) said.    The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulfcapital markets that investors have to relinquish traditionalinvestment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bankaccounts and precious metals.    "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled withmore diversified capital market instruments and a change in thedisclosure requirements on company accounts," he said.    The GIB study reviewed capital markets under threecategories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.    Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use ofshort-term money market instruments and banks in the region hadfloated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.    "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a largeextent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said.    Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loansand bank facilities and very few companies had made use ofstock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stockexchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establishexchanges.    But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capitalmarkets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.    He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capitalmarkets in the region."    In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,financial awareness among investors is still lacking andinvestment analysis and corporate reporting standards lackdepth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s promptedinvestors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.    Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in someGulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adoptfinancial innovations had also hampered capital markets.    He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporationof joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.    Azzam said capital market instruments should be madeavailable to all citizens and institutions of Gulf CooperationCouncil (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, SaudiArabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had beentaken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals toown up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.    Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depthfrom the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain andthe expansion of securities repurchase regulations in SaudiArabia.    But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in SaudiArabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyaldenominated bond issued in 1978.    While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and tradingin Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formalexchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,Azzam said. REUTER&#3;

Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free marketoil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below thepronounced prices under any circumstance."    Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free marketprices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)winter season and the glut in the market."    Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord,under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixedprices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.    The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets,which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel inmid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market pricesare currently just over 16 dlrs.    Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia'sadherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.    He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they allwanted to stick to the accord.

The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It wasthe seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicatorwas over 50 pct.    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economyis in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a decliningeconomy.    The  NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managersat 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growthrate in new orders and production slowed in February.    But production remained vigorous, with more than threetimes as many members reporting it better rather than worse.    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but membersreported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp graduallyresumed production.    The same number of members reported inventories were higheras reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happenedsince August 1984.    For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported payinghigher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nineto one.    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business surveycommittee, said: "The economy continued to expand in February,but at a more subdued rate than in January.

"We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't beenabolished at all," he told Reuters in an interview.    He said the system would be reintroduced after currenttalks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fundand, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.    Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auctionsystem would be used to allocate foreign exchange to privatebidders but not to fix the exchange rate.    Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of thegovernment's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.    It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation andstrong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossiblefor the government and the private sector, he said.    Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. Thekwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.In January 1987 the government was more than two months inarrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, andthe auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchangerate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

reut2-000.sgm, EC MINISTERS CONSIDER BIG AGRICULTURE PRICE CUTS, European Community (EC) agricultureministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cutsin prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protestsby European farmers, Community officials said.    The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC'sBrussels Commission, which for the fourth year running hascalled for radical changes in the price support system.    EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge foodsurpluses, which have alienated international trade partnersand pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand suchaction.    With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnesof unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and hugestocks of wine and olive oil, Andriessen says bluntly the daysof open-ended price guarantees must end.    EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed pricespaid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for thenew marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as ECmembers cut funds and demand greater budget discipline.    Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupledwith reductions in other support mechanisms, which could leadto price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products.    A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixedguaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to bescaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases.    The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure onagriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallowtwo-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion Europeancurrency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expectedshortfall this year of about five billion Ecus.    The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oilsand fats tax and a change in the "green" exchange rate system,which translates EC farm prices into national currencies.    The tax, of up to 330 Ecus per tonne, would be levied onimported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could triggera fresh trade dispute with the United States, which providesthe EC with the bulk of its soybeans.    It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fatproducts in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butterconsumption.    West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, whichwould cause a fall in prices for producers as countries withweak and strong currencies were brought more into line. REUTER&#3;

The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billiondlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due betweenJanuary 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack onanother 5.8 billion dlrs, rescheduled in a 1985 accord, to anynew agreement, the officials said.    Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentagepoint over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) andVenezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBORportend well for the Philippines, despite Brazil's repaymentsuspension last week, the officials said.    Manila, which has not made any principal repayments since1983, wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a77 billion dlr rescue.    Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate, which iscurrently hovering around 6-1/2 pct.    The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offeredwhen the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7.    Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments.    One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-typeaccord, which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusingto endorse five months after it was signed.

They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymahterminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last monthfrom 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by somecustomers.    But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulfexports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpdfrom 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.    The production figures include neutral zone output but notsales from floating storage, which are generally consideredpart of a country's output for Opec purposes.    Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under aproduction restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation grouplast December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrsa barrel.    The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last weekappeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift Februaryentitlements before the month-end.    Last week's high export levels appeared to show continuedsupport for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crudecustomers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.    The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc&lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreementlast month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.

Spot prices have fallen in recentweeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.    Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterdayreiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accordand said it would never sell below official prices.

Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reutersthey supported the proposed linking of computer trading systemson the three exchanges, and the banking sources said localfinancial support for the plan existed.    Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move thethree exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with Singapore fillinga gap when no trading takes place.    A small group of selected stocks would be used at the startof three-centre trading to determine investor interest.

Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploysufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate marketliquidity and communication links to the other three centres.    But if agreement is reached, Singapore will have a headstart over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong,Toyko and Australia, he said.

reut2-000.sgm, GERMAN EUROBOND MARKET EXPECTS BREATHING SPACE, After an onslaught of new paper, fewermark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said.    Most managers said they were planning a low issue volumefor the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today.    "We want to have a week's pause," one manager said.    Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks,including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank.Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks,from 3.6 billion in January.    The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the verybest addresses were having to accept higher coupons.    "I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if youcan give a good coupon," another manager said.    But even some government borrowers were not getting thebest reception for bonds which would have been taken up morereadily under other conditions.    Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone,bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside feeson Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows.    Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Fridayat 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price.    A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraphand Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within feesat 98.15, 98.50 from its par price.    Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond forHoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanksmainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said.    The large amount of paper brought to the market in the lasttwo months has also led many syndicate managers to complainabout the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, whichthey say is too inflexible.    Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to beregistered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding thetwo-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond onthe requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for thenext calendar period to schedule the bond again.    Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.    The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeksfrom four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to becompletely abolished. "I don't think the Bundesbank would givethat up," one banking analyst said.    "I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,"the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating thevolume of new issues themselves.    The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendarwithout trying to regulate the issues, but it needs theregistration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going throughthe euromarket, he said.    For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbanksacrificing its present calendar system.    Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndicationdepartments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing tothe carnival holiday.    Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday.In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon. REUTER&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, IRAQ DEFERS PAYMENTS ON 500 MLN DLR EUROLOAN, Iraq has secured agreement to deferoutstanding payments on a 500 mln dlr syndicated euroloanfollowing five months of negotiations with creditor banks.    Banking sources said the rescheduling is part of Iraq'scontinuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as itseconomy comes under strain from the  Gulf War and soft worldoil prices.    Iraq informed the 37 banks in the loan syndicate lastSeptember it could not meet the remaining four principalrepayments totalling 285 mln dlrs, and missed the first ofthese for 71.25 mln due on September 29.    The 500 mln dlr credit, under the lead management ofParis-based Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF), has afive-year maturity and a margin of one percentage point overLondon Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).    Banking sources said the agreement now worked out goes someway to meeting creditor bank demands that at least part of thefirst missing instalment of 71.25 mln dlrs be paid and notdeferred.    One quarter or 17.8 mln dlrs will be paid on signature ofthe accord, expected in late March, with the remainder in threemore instalments to be made every six months.    The remaining three principal instalments - originally duein March 1987, September 1987 and March 1988 - will each bedeferred for two years from the due date, banking sources said.    The margin for the loan remains unchanged and no penaltyinterest is being imposed, the sources added.    Bank reaction to Iraq's rescheduling request has been oneof resignation, with many bankers seeing little alternative forBaghdad's economic planners. Iraq is estimated to have foreigndebt of about 50 billion dlrs, although about half is thoughtto be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies,particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.    The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-ownedRafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit, a 500 mln dlrdeal under the agency of Gulf International Bank, was signed inOctober, 1985 and is still in a two year grace period.    The bulk of Iraq's commercial debt - excluding loans by itsallies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing.    But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters ofcredit last March and a series of negotiations with banks andwestern government export credit agencies has been underway.Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment ofobligations due on letters of credit.

Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and morecompanies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, butthe proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review ofpublic bond issues, they said.    "Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not onlyto straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds andwarrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseasmarkets," a Nikko Securities house bond manager said.    Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days aftera corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now,the securities managers said.    Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuancesystem, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end,and accept issue requests during the month, they said.    Securities houses also plan to introduce free competitionamong underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms inorder to better reflect the market, securities managers said.    Market participants expect the new issue methods to beapplied beginning in April, with the projected issue by &lt;NipponTelegraph and Telephone Corp>.    The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice oftaking lead-managership and enables more market-orienteddecisions on terms, securities sources said.    The four major Japanese securities houses now take turnsunderwriting corporate bonds.    Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared bysecurities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latestpublic bonds is now almost automatic, they said.    The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made inlate December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bondmarket, securities house managers said.    The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securitieshouses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling forcompanies wanting to issue non-collateral straight andconvertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said.    The cut will more than double the number of corporationsable to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straightbonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said.    The Bond Market Committee of the Securities ExchangeCouncil also recommended introduction of a shelf registrationsystem, more use of corporate ratings systems andsimplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuingprocess, securities sources said.    It also called for a major review of the commissioned banksystem, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, andfor deregulation of private placements, they said.    Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to putinto effect, the sources said. A shelf registration systemwould need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in1988, the sources said. REUTER&#3;

A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanesecreditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese supportfor a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlrforeign debt, bankers said.    The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bankcreditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeriaalthough about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to acceptrescheduling of part of their existing loans.    "The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanesecreditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of thenation's debt situation," said another Japanese bank official.

reut2-000.sgm, JAPAN SALES TAX MAY FORCE NAKASONE OUT OF OFFICE, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likelyto leave office this summer amid opposition to hiscontroversial tax-reform package, political analysts said.    They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician hassuffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pctsales tax planned for January 1988.    "Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at theend of his administration, which is not only impossible butalso is very irresponsible as a politican," Rei Shiratori,professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters.    "Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon asparliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,"Shiratori said.    Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members ofparliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says isneeded to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes.    Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDPmembers who oppose the tax. "There are some who are objectingbecause of their constituencies," he told a meeting ofgovernment and party leaders. "If the party discipline isbroken, I would like to see punishment considered."    "A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partlybecause Nakasone breached his election pledge againstintroducing it," Shiratori said.    "Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feelsuncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen'sappreciation and about the future when the Japanese society israpidly aging," he said.    Political analysts said the controversial tax could affectthe more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April,involving governors, mayors, town and village heads andassemblies at all levels.    But the situation is complicated, since opposition partiesexcluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates withthe LDP, the political analysts added.    Shiratori said, "In the worst case, implementation of thesales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off forsome time before the government makes a final decision.    "Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct toperhaps three pct.    "A third alternative for the government is to ram throughthe bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs," he said.    Seizaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University,thought the last possibility most likely. "I think the LDP alonewill take a vote on the tax bills," he said.    The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and143 in the 252-seat Upper House.    To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDPpushes through the tax bills, the Nakasone cabinet will have toresign, Sato said.    "Boycotting opposition members will be more willing toreturn to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed," he said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS, Mine and industry officials frommost member states of the Association of Tin ProducingCountries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit groupexports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, accordingto views polled by Reuter correspondents.    The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed atcutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now andboosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16.    Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC accountfor some 65 pct of the world's tin output.    Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an exportquota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000,Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.    Australia has said it is not setting any export quota.However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughlyequal to its expected output this year.    Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable.    Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer,said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure thatoutput is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year startedMarch 1.    Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters thatexcess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 inthe one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.    Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curband asked the government not to issue new mining licences. Morethan 100 applications for licences are pending.    Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mininglicences only if a six-month review of production trends showedthat local mines were not overproducing.    ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy MinisterSubroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb.    A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PTTambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia tostick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this wasclose to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.    In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu saidThailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added thiswould not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.    To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tinexporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encouragebigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would bepermitted, he said.    The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected todisallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessiveproduction, industry sources said.    But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong toldReuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo,Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines.    Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in1985, Pramual said.    Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year thanits allocated 13,761 tonne quota.    Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Pazthat Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin incalendar 1987.    He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis ofOctober 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the statemining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct ofBolivia's total exports.    He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exportsbut added he was confident the goals set by the plan would beachieved. He did not elaborate.    Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said inLagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within itsATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output haddeclined due to poor demand and high production costs.    Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output wasless than 1,000 tonnes last year.    ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries'export figures every three months using customs documents andmake projections from such data to see if quotas were likely tobe breached within the year-long quota period.    The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely tobreach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.    They added that if member countries were unable to fulfiltheir quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to othermembers at the ATPC's discretion.    The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.    Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate withthe ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnesrespectively during the quota period. REUTER&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, SAN MIGUEL BOARD APPOINTMENT MAY MEAN CHANGES, Disagreement over management of &lt;SanMiguel Corp> (SMC) may follow the Philippine government'sappointment of a well-known banker to the SMC board, investmentanalysts said.    They told Reuters the presence of &lt;United Coconut PlantersBank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may meanchanges in SMC management, which for decades was controlled bythe family of its president, Andres Soriano.    Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls51 pct of San Miguel's stock, after another nominee resigned.    The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holdssix seats on the 15-member SMC board, which represent 33.13 mlnsequestered shares.    The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned byEduardo Cojuangco, then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel. He wasa close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos, and heleft the country after Marcos's fall.    Before the seizure, Soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid forthe shares, paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit.    The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. They tradedat 93 pesos today, down from 95.50 at Friday's close.    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters on Saturdaythat Sy would definitely sit on the SMC board despite theobjections of some directors associated with Soriano.    "I don't think there is a conflict of interest as such," hesaid.    "I was potentially concerned with seeing a situation whereyou have a contentious atmosphere on the board. But Sy hasassured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in acontentious manner," Ongpin added.    The Soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposingSy's directorship. Its lawyer said in a letter to the PCGG thata pending suit seeking forfeiture of SMC's 500 mln peso depositand major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented aclear conflict.    UCPB, however, sought board representation before Sy'sappointment, petitioning the PCGG "so that the interests of theowners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected."    Investment analysts polled by Reuters said the UCPB had aright to a slot on the SMC board as trustee for coconut farmerswho claim ownership of the disputed shares.    The analysts said Sy, backed by the government, wouldprobably suggest replacements for PCGG nominees expected toresign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting governmentofficials from working for private companies. SMC's annualelection is scheduled for May.    A UCPB spokesman declined to comment, saying it was up tothe PCGG to decide whom to appoint.    One analyst said objections were understandable from thefamily that founded the company 97 years ago.    "It is a natural instinct of self-preservation for Soriano,"he said.    SMC posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on netsales of 10.99 billion pesos against 422.3 mln in 1984 on salesof 10.36 billion. REUTER&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, INDIAN BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN FUELING INFLATION, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficitwill push up India's moderate inflation rate and that thecountry's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty,economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters.    The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate ofa record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87.    The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based onwholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86.    Economists pointed out that the government itself hadexpressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87economic survey report published last week.    Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, PrimeMinister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed totrim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, hesaid.    But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously.They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from aninitial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees.    Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition BharatiyaJanata party, said Gandhi's failure to mention specificmeasures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices.    Economists said increased liquidity in the economy, asreflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply, maycause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86period.    Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects,after bad weather last year, may strain prices further.    Economists said the deficit would also cause the governmentto rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans andbonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, upfrom the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion.    No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes,which will discourage savings, economists said.    Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned UnionBank of India, said the annual inflation rate may double toaround 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currencynotes to cover the deficit.    Brokers said stock market investors have started sellinglong-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in thebudget that reduces the holding period required to claimexemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three.    Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said, "There is uncertaintyin the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure."    But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hecticselling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on thescene. "Just now there is acute nervousness in the market," hesaid.    Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to helpsmall investors buy equity shares and relaxations in thecapital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the marketon a long-term basis.

Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition wasbeing made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N>, which currentlyholds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.    Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pcteach and these stakes will be bought over the next six years.    RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of thelargest U.S. Government securities brokers.    It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and otherinstruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.    Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S.Government securities broker for the past four years and hadmade an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp&lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.    B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would bebought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting netincome of around 16 mln dlrs.    The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving ofbrokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.    Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 inthe brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit, whichprovided computer software for the financial servicescommunity.    RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total marketturnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs aday, and in London where it has 15 billion.

reut2-000.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTERITY MEASURES IN HUNGARY, Hungary is to embark on a new series ofausterity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripledlast year after quadrupling in 1985.    The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved byParliament last December was 43.8 billion forints.    But Zoltan Boesze, chief of the Finance Ministry's budgetfinancing division, told Reuters the government now saw this astoo high and had decided "quite severe" measures were needed.    "All the organizations of economic management have beencharged with elaborating further (savings) measures," he said.    Asked if these measures were being taken under pressurefrom the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: "TheFund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results,and of course the Fund would support these efforts."    IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year.    Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's statebudget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints lastyear from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984.    The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forintsbecause of poor performance by state firms, which neededsubsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency.    The exact extent and nature of savings are still underdiscussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largestbudget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said.    Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain lowconsumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985.Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.    "I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up theformer situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,"Boesze said. "The central administration must be hard. ... If weare not hard then we will not be successful."    Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserveprovisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. "I believethese reserves should not be used at all," he said.    Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domesticproduct, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct.    The authorities had already signalled a small fall in realwages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe taxpenalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.    This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retailprice inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.    A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1.    About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.    Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significantcuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations madethis difficult.    But he added: "I think ultimately we will be able to makecurtailments in subsidies in this area as well."    He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at thebeginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation andvalue added tax. The IMF supports these aims.    Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in anattempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms.    Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to beunemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline isbeing tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.    Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the stateby firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises toshed labour. He gave no exact figures.    Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsiblefor drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hopedthe law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct.    After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest singlebudget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approvedfor 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion).    Interest payments on international debt are set to rise tomore than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and sevenbillion in 1986, Boesze said.    Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last yearto 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, whiletrade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of morethan 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two yearsearlier.    Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pctby credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10pct by the issue of domestic state bonds.    Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarianeconomists in a speech this month that the country's economywas in a "very difficult" situation, but not in crisis.    There would have to be a turnround with tangible resultsthis year, however, and borrowing must be used moreeffectively.    "Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous,"Berecz said.

reut2-000.sgm, DIGITAL AUDIO TAPE PLAYERS GO ON SALE IN JAPAN, Japanese consumers hesitated about buyingthe controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went onsale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player's near-perfectsound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper.    "The sound is great, but I'll wait until more machines hitthe market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buyingone," said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee.    Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT playerstoday although delivery will take about two weeks, retailerssaid. Aiwa's machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen.    Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appearas early as the end of March, industry sources said.    DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superiorto even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size ofthe standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analoguemachines, they can make copies an infinite number of times withalmost no loss of sound quality.    This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tapepiracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed theDAT player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitrybe built into the machines.    Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip toprevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can stillbe made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier."Nobody can tell the difference," one salesman said.    DAT players have been kept off Western markets and somecountries are considering banning them or imposing heavy dutiesunless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanesehardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of thehigh yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out aprofitable niche.    Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possiblyto around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put theirproducts on the market, industry analysts said.    They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units peryear.    Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DATplayer on the world market later this year. REUTER&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ITALIAN BOOM, Italy's strong economic revival has ledsome observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in somequarters about future growth prospects, but many Italianexperts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive.    "I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italianmiracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers alwaysoscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism andunwarranted optimism," says Luigi Spaventa, one of Italy'sleading economists and a professor at Rome University.    According to Spaventa, these violent swings of mood havebeen occurring for the last 15 years, with Italy one minuteseen as the "bad boy of Europe" and unable to raise a dollar andthe next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration,    "I think there's a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to bethe underground economy and all the correspondents of foreignnewspapers flocked to Italy to study this. That was anotherstory about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a darkroom."    Spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialistshere, stress Italy's recent achievements, particularly thedramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrialenterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable.     Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A.,&lt;FIAT.M> and &lt;ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming, themajor state industries are back in the black after years oflosses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance ofpayments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by someexperts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world'sfifth largest economy have also boosted optimism.    Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what itfeels to be its second-rate status among the majorindustrialised countries.    Only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of thisstatus after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministersfrom the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States,Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.    Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated anagreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canadaattend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concernedmanaging the international monetary system.    But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problemsstill facing its economy, economists and industrialists say.    "We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,"warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti.    He says that while Italy's recent achievements are indeedcause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be onthe problems still remaining rather than those already solved.    The country's huge state sector deficit, high unemploymentand a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the mostworrying problems, experts say.    The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billionlire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiralagain, says Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the private Luissuniversity in Rome.    Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in adecade in September 1984 and by January this year was runningat 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guaranteeinternational competiveness, economists and industrialists say.    And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally lastOctober according to the latest official data.    Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 millionpeople seeking work in October 1986, almost 73 pct were agedbetween 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north.    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product(GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pctin 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough tocheck rising unemployment.    Another problem is Italy's reliance on imported rawmaterials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs.    This factor actually worked sharply in Italy's favour lastyear, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's tradedeficit to 3,717 billion lire  by year end from 23,085 billionlire in 1985.    But economists say the improvement owes little to anystructural change in the Italian economy and that any reversalof the trend in costs could have serious consequences.    If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world's topindustrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarketoperating procedures and encourage firms to supply more qualityinformation about their activities, economists say.    Italy has no controls on insider trading.    The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movementscontrols -- a European Community directive calls for these tobe dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a lessblinkered attitude and a change in traditional operatingprocedures, economists say.    "Even today, if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse, Idoubt I'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in bankswhich would allow me to do that," says Spaventa. REUTER&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS, Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-leveltrade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides aregrowing increasingly irritated with each other.    The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review thewhole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the wayfor American Secretary of State George Schultz's one daystop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.    Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action toreduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.    "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanesegovernment official said. "But we are also frustrated."    The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slashspending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,but it will, he said.    He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progressthat has been made and instead emphasizing the problems thatremain when it talks with Congress.    "It would only take five minutes to list theiraccomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.    The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on theeconomic structures of both countries and how they affect thebilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48billion dlrs in Japan's favour.    On the following two days, the topics will range frommultilateral trade talks under the auspices of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral tradeproblems as super computers.    The structural talks are intended to be free-wheelingdiscussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics includesavings and investment issues such as consumer credit andhousing, and the implications of government budget deficits.    These talks come at a particularly delicate time for theJapanese government, which is facing increasing domesticpressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy andstimulate the sagging economy by spending more.    Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention ofboosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.    Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the hugeU.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the tradeimbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Isbuying more imports.    Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a drafttrade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserialtrade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," oneJapanese official said.    That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-outbill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.    Japan is also not totally happy with the administration'strade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocalaccess to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory tradeaction by the U.S., Officials said.    Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weakbargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade billoverhanging them.    "We have no leverage," one official admitted.    As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaintsabout its trade practices in a variety of fields, includingsuper computers.    The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanesesuper computer market.    The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire topublic institutions like universities which buy thesophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting upinformal bidding procedures easily understood by all potentialsellers, officials said.

According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EChad risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes betweenAugust and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct ofthe EC market if they continue at the same pace.    The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them tocut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs.

reut2-000.sgm, MANILA OFFICIALS SPLIT OVER DEBT STRATEGY, A rift has occured among Philippineofficials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York withEconomic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chiefnegotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement.    Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin haddecided not to insist on Manila's creditor banks pledging tofund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billiondlrs.    "He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast aspossible. I'm saying that's very short-sighted," Monsod said.    Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6billion dlrs of the Philippines' total foreign debt of 27.8billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resourcetransfer in the same period.    Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points overthe London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).    Monsod said,  "Right now we are saying to the banks, let'sshare the financing burden."    Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group ofmultilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growthfacility to bridge the funding gap.     He said the government and the consultative group wouldmeet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aiddonors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked tofinance any gap on a shared basis.    He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try topin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility.    Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics."Secretary Monsod and I get along famously," he said. "She talksand I listen but I don't necessarily agree."    Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridgingthe financing gap would have aided the government'spump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan.    She said if private sector investment continued to be heldback by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and risinginterest rates, the country would fail to achieve its grossnational product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct overthe next six years.    "If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan.How can there be a program if there is no finance?" she said,adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy.    "It (Ongpin's stand) is going to make it much more difficultfor the economy to attain its growth targets," Monsod said.    "Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is goingto press for there is absolutely no reason why they should notbe able to come back (from New York) in a day," she said.    Monsod, the government's chief economic planner, stressedManila's policy was growth before debt.    She said if the banks refused to lend the new money, thePhilippines should copy Brazil's action last week in freezingall debt repayments.    "If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some ofthe money that you are sending abroad, then of course you havean option," Monsod said. "You just don't send it abroad. You do aBrazil."

Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economicplanning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would furtherreduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the secondhalf of this year.    Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year andWang said further cuts would go much deeper.    "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffsfaster and more substantially," he said.    The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has saidthe island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high ofalmost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts astoo selective.     Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreignexchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said madeTaiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.    Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakenedTaiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas,particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which areamong the island's main export-earners.

He did not make any specific projections for the company'searnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend ofnot less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposedfour-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.    It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and sharesplit.    Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading toproperty and container terminals, earlier reported after-taxprofits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.    The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mlndlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the SouthChina Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said itexpects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of theremaining shares.

Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last yearagainst an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.    But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affectthe British colony.

The Association's composite survey index declined to 51.9pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It wasthe seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicatorwas over 50 pct.    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economyis in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a decliningeconomy.    The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managersat 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growthrate in new orders and production slowed in February.    However, production remained vigorous as more than threetimes as many members reported it better rather than worse.    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but membersreported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel &lt;X>gradually resumed production.    An equal number of members reported inventories were higherand lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August1984.    For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higherrather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business surveycommittee and director of materials management at Pitney BowesInc &lt;PBI> said "the economy continued to expand in February,but at a more subdued rate than in January.

reut2-000.sgm, FUNARO SAYS BRAZIL NEEDS MORE, FASTER FINANCE, Brazil would not have suspendedpayments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received moreand faster financing from official lending agencies, FinanceMinister Dilson Funaro said.    He said he would not seek more money from the InternationalMonetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year andsaid Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention.    "It's a question of why the official lending agencies don'tfinance a little bit more quickly and easily," Funaro toldreporters at the Brazilian Embassy.    Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments ofmonthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders ifofficial lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied,"Yes, because our country did not receive financing from theseagencies."    Asked how long the payment suspension would last, Funarosaid "It all depends on what kind of financing we are going toreceive from the other side."    Brazil, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs,stunned the banking community last week by suspending paymentson some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks.    Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the WorldBank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in thepast four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans.    He said the net transfer was hurting the country'scontinued growth and capacity to import goods.    "Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has tobe found to finance a country like Brazil," Funaro said.    He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said hewould like to see "automatic" official lending when needed sothat Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves,now reported to be below four billion dlrs.    Funaro said Brazil had the world's third-largest tradesurplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eightbillion dlrs.    But he said that without increased and faster lending fromofficial institutions, the nation could not rely on its exportearnings to finance development and imports and also serviceits debt.    "We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment andinternal adjustment," Funaro said.    He complained that official lending agencies had imposedtight control on credit over the past four years, leavingcommercial bank refinancing as the only credit available.    Funaro said U.S officials understand his position "but theydon't like it." Later he left Washington for a tour of Europeand debt discussions with officials in Britain, West Germany,France, Switzerland and Italy.

reut2-000.sgm, AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS, American Express Co, rumored to beconsidering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unitthat could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meetbroadening international competition.    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson saidthe actions under consideration are an integral part ofAmerican Express' worldwide financial services strategy andthat the two companies have been having both internal andexternal discussions on the matters.    American Express said no decision has been reached on thestrategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimatelydecide to follow growth plans already in place.    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that thefinancial services giant was considering a spinoff of part ofShearson and there was speculation it may be consideringselling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said thespeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct ofthe profitable brokerage firm to the public.    There was some speculation that American Express had alsoconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan wasconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said.     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that itwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesmanwould not go beyond the statement. The company also remainedsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove AmericanExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring itto a Friday close at 74.     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because asimilar statement was being circulated to employees.    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense forAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-ownedbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50pct in the last year.    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinningoff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stockprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.    American Express' ambitious plans for international growthmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out partof Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all ofShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling."(American) Express is in a position where they can raisecapital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder ofPrudential-Bache Securities.    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization ofShearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer JeffreyLane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.     The reorganization also created four new positions forchairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analystsspeculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement doeslittle to clarify last week's market speculation. It doesconfirm, however, that the financial services firm, whichunsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a majoracquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls forgrowth and positioning in the global market competition.    Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts saidthere had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed whenit approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

The surplus, including cash transactions and long-terminvestments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billionfrancs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986budget.    All categories of revenues were higher than forecast, andexpenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast.    The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61billion proposed in the original 1986 budget.    Tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985deficit of 696 mln.    Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs aboveforecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expectedreceipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions.    Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more thanplanned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said.    The ministry said the improvement in the overall accountreflected years of efforts by the government and parliament tointroduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary taxincreases. But economic factors, including the low rate ofinflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oilprices were also important factors.    A spokesman for the ministry said the government had usedits improved cash position to retire about one billion francsof government debt, which accounted for the difference betweenthe 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mlnfranc overall surplus.

Both of the newmachines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be fasterand more versatile, but considerably more expensive thanearlier models.    The Mac SE (SE stands for "system expansion"), which Applesays will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus,goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price rangingfrom 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features.    The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster thanthe Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and pricedbetween 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs.    Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells forabout 2,200 dlrs.    Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorldConference in Los Angeles.    Company officials expressed high hopes for both computersat a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performanceMac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to theexpanding market for science and engineering workstations.    John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer,declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the Mac SEshould contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line thisyear. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users.    "I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice formost people," he said.

"The graphics interface on the Mac products issignificantly better than anything IBM has to date."    International Business Machines is expected to announceupdated personal computers this spring.    The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor, an"open architecture" that allows for the addition of numerousperipheral devices, a built-in hard disk and one megabyte ofmemory, expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped witha 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor.

reut2-000.sgm, PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH>, New Jersey-based overnight messengerPurolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired forabout 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Incand certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale forsome time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling atakeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was fromanother courier company.    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton GroupInc, will be majority owner of the company.    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, ispaying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stockin a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shareswill be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in asubsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.courier operations.    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholderswould receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs indebentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PCAcquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mlndlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PCAcquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock ofthe PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valuedthe warrants at two to three dlrs per share.    Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreedrecently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closurecaps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said thefirm is reviewing its options on Stant.    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of itsU.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the pastseveral years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds tocomplete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financingwill be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in theform of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed tokeeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.    "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two yearslargely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe themanagement is turning around. We belive it will be a veryserious competitor in the future," said Idsal.    William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courierdivision, will be chief executive officer of the new company.    The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of twothirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn tothe expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.    The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances fromthe staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire20 business days after commencement unless extended. Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - ASSET-BACK MARKET GROWS, The U.S. asset-backed debt securitiesmarket, which grew explosively last year, is broadening andinvestment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.    "It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backeddeals of the year were done by commercial banks," said AnthonyDub, who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group.    BankAmerica Corp's &lt;BAC> Bank of America unit last weekissued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit cardreceivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said theoffering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.    The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's &lt;RPT>RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the bookson that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager.    However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were moreclosely related to the so-called "cars deals" that raced tomarket last year than were the RepublicBank securities.    "The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit cardreceivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was thefirst public offering of credit card receivables because weused a grantor trust vehicle," he said.    In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificatesthat represent a specified percentage of an undivided interestin the trust, analysts explained.    The Bank of America certificates were issued by CaliforniaCredit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that singlepurpose, investment bankers pointed out.    The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and pricedit at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points overcomparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the dealwas rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's.    Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed theBank of America deal was priced too aggressively. "AAA-ratedauto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasurieswhen First Boston priced the deal," one said.    However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.    The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal'stop-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year'scars deals, which were rated by S and P alone.    "Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18months and then interest and principal payments for theremaining five to seven months," Dub detailed.    Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank ofAmerica deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, theissue had a longer average life than some of the cars dealsthat were brought to market late last year.    The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA creditcard receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of Americahas about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, makingit one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said.    Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray intothe young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.    In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via CaliforniaCars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backedby automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc.    Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notesbacked by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, aunit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack TrucksReceivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc &lt;MACK>, viaShearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.

reut2-000.sgm, REAGAN AND BAKER BEGIN TASK OF REBUILDING, After a week that left his presidencyshaken and his popularity at a new low, Ronald Reagan and hisnew chief of staff today begin trying to revive anadministration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal.    Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker,whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisanpraise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathingcriticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms withIran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon.    Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle isassessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report hasdone to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Caseyas the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency.    White House officials are checking to see how much supportGates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would haveif his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote,Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said.    Appearing on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press," theKansas senator said the Gates nomination "could be in somedifficulty."    Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priorityby Baker.    Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms salescandal, lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gatesnomination is not assured and, even if won, would come onlyafter months of congressional probes into the affair.    "He has the smell of Iran on him," said former Nevada Sen.and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt. "He is a victim."    Laxalt, appearing on the ABC News program, "This Week WithDavid Brinkley," bluntly admitted "the Gates nomination is introuble." Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn saidthe odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates.    When asked on the syndicated television program, "JohnMcLaughlin: One on One," if he thought Gates would be confirmed,the Georgia Democrat shot back: "I wouldn't bet any money on it.    "I think this report hurts that," Nunn said. "It indicatesthat the National Security Council had policy-type influenceover intelligence-type activities and we're going to go intothat with Mr. Gates.    Only a day after it was issued last week, the Tower reportprompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chiefof staff.    Regan, the former Wall Street executive and Treasurysecretary who has been the president's top aide for the pasttwo years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for thebotched handling of the Iran arms sale.    The report blamed Regan for the "chaos that descended on theWhite House" since it was first revealed last November thatprofits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contrarebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government.    The two other victims of the scandal are former NationalSecurity Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned andMarine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it wasdisclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms salewere diverted to the contras. The two, pictured by the Towercommission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal, haverefused to testify.    Reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayedin the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whoseinattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy.    That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity andthreatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leavesoffice in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll foundthat just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership,a record low, and a third believed he should considerresignation.    After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring overthe meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen.John Tower, Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide televisionaddress this week to respond to the criticisms of hispresidency.

reut2-000.sgm, BRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE, Brazil is not happy with the existingstructure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinatesits commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.    U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committeewhile holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,however.    Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese andEuropean banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adoptan approach involving separate discussions with the regions.    Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on acase-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply tocreditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.    Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interestpayments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followedlast week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines depositedby foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.    Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week inWashington talking to government officials and internationalagencies and will this week visit Britain, France, WestGermany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions withgovernments.    Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe andGovernor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.    Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.    The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chiefmeans of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharplyand the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in thecountry's&#127;ate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to havedropped below four billion dlrs.    Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problemswith Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve onlypartial servicing of the debt.    "What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinancefor part of the service, because we cannot service all that," hesaid. "I really think we have to change the old rules."    Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, ratherthan the commercial banks themselves in its search for asolution to the crisis, Funaro said "We must first talk to thegovernments and then we can talk to the banks, because thebanks have some limits."    "It is a political discussion from our point of view," hesaid.    Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk toJapanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talkto the commercial banks "If I've got some solution from thegovernments. I can't take the burden only to the banks." He wasnot sure how long it would take to reach a solution. &#127;  In discussions with governments Brazil would review themechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations inneed. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtuallyclosed since 1982. "You must open these mechanisms," he said.    He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed byBrazil's suspension of interest payments, they understoodBrazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.    Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed "becausewe can't stay as we were the last few years."    "I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of uswould like to have a kind of equilibrium." he said. AlthoughBrazil has rejected a substantive role for the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a callin Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and toWorld Bank President Barber Conable.    Funaro noted that inflation in February had started todecline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eightbillion dlr trade surplus in 1987.    Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus haddeclined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of lastyear, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.    Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world,Funaro said, although its share of international trade was onlyone pct.  "The solution is linked with growth, not recession," hesaid, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports andinducing an internal recession in order to service debt.    Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments,as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounderstructure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Clubof creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.

reut2-000.sgm, U.K. SAYS HAS NO ROLE IN BRAZIL MORATORIUM TALKS, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro thatnegotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matterfor the commercial banks themselves, a Treasury spokesman said.    The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talksthis morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authoritiesto be able to present a convincing economic program to thecountry's creditors. He added an accord with the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support.    Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks.    Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as aclear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining officialcooperation in resolving its external debt crisis.    Funaro, accompanied by central bank president FranciscoGros, is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in anattempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinitesuspension of interest payments earlier this month.    Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for theIMF in managing its economy, arguing that an IMF austerityprogram by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumptionwould lead to recession and threaten democracy.    Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part oftheir trip to enlist support from governments for its attemptsto change the means by which developing countries financegrowth.    Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would nothave suspended payment on its debt if it had received more andfaster financing from international agencies.    He said earlier today that Brazil was first approachinggovernments before talking to the commercial banks themselvesabout the interest payment moratorium "because the banks havesome limits.... It's a political discussion from our point ofview."    Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officialshad resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolveBrazil's debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initialcontact.    He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.    The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks hadbeen at Funaro's request.    After travelling this week to France, Germany, Switzerlandand Italy, Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next weekbefore starting negotiations with banks. REUTER&#3;

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National AmusementsInc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cashportion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stockhe is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.    The Redstone offer, which is being made through ArsenalHoldings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for thatpurpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of ashare of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bidsfrom Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacommanagement which is competing with Redstone for control of thecompany and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.    The company did not disclose the details of the revisedoffers, but said a special committee of its board would reviewthem later today.    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have bothagreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger iscompleted, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer forat least half of the outstanding stock.    The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,which give them access to Viacom's financial records providedthey keep the information secret.    In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost ofcompleting the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank ofAmerica is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.    Besides the financing it would raise through a banksyndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide aseparate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partialfinancing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,Redstone said.    Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increasedits underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinatedfinancing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrsit agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.    Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mlndlrs in equity toward the takeover.    The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover wouldconsist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common sharesand at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.    The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone hasproposed in his month-long bidding war with management, alsocontains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.    Last week, the management group submitted what it calledits last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs andconsisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valuedat eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company.

The latest requests for the maize were for export toSwitzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebateprefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20Ecu daily rebate.

If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,this will bring the total of French maize exported in thiscontext to 25,500 tonnes.    The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for thesale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.

U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect theeconomy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.    The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a privategroup, also called for new research for oil exploration anddevelopment techniques.    It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs abarrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, withimports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.    The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: toprotect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other suchdevice or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil.    But the group did not strongly back either option, sayingthere were benefits and drawbacks to both.

The deadline for a final determination is March 7.    U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in asimilar case covering European pasta imports. In that case,Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of theCanadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. cornexports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.    Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. cornimports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts lastmonth because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

reut2-000.sgm, EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY, European Community steelmakerspresented the Executive Commission with a controversial planfor the future of the industry which diplomats say it may beforced reluctantly to accept.    Under the plan steel output would remain subject torestrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled foryears to come while steel firms undertook a massiveslimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed theending of the quota system by December 1988.    He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EClaw is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis."    But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss thisidea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis intheir countries, with orders falling as customers switch toalternative products and accounts firmly in the red.    Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries arelikely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back theindustry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising thepolitical impact of plant closures, they said.    Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by theEC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quotaproduction system at least until the end of 1990.    Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for itidentified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis toreduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.    Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, thatof hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.    Eurofer added the industry would need the support of theCommission and governments in carrying out a closure program,particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments.    The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs thisdecade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes. Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, CME PLANS RULE CHANGES TIGHTENING S/P TRADING, Directors of the Chicago MercantileExchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petitionasking the exchange to tighten rules covering tradingactivities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 StockIndex futures pit, an exchange executive said.    The petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legalpractice where traders execute customer orders as well as tradefor their own account.    But exchange officials noted this practice also provides anopportunity for a trader to engage in what is called"front-running", where traders enter orders for their own accountbefore executing orders for their customers.    Leo Melamed, CME special counsel, said directors will ruleon the petition on Wednesday, but added that a special S and PAdvisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futurestrading conditions for the last six months and is expected tosubmit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days.    In addition to a recommendation on dual trading, Melamedsaid the special committee will also make suggestions about apossible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that wouldalleviate congested conditions in the trading pit.    Melamed said directors are likely to approve therecommendations of the special committee because "most actionsof the board are in line with committee recommendations."    CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the boardaccepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will besubmitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission forapproval.    If the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request,a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membershipfor a vote within 15 days, Beyer said.    Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled onbefore the recommendations from the special committee are made"it will confuse the issue."    Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrictdual trading.    Although Jonathan Wolff, senior vice president at DonaldsonLufkin and Jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on mostexchanges.    "It's a question of the integrity of the person you dobusiness with," Wolff said.    Futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain thattrading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make upfor errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders inchaotic futures trading pits.    "To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficultfor a broker to function because of his errors," said JohnMichael, vice president at First Options of Chicago.    "What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,"he said.    Furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokeragemakes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said.    "If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), oreven suspected him of doing it, I would cut him off," Michaelsaid.    An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit, forinstance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a dayat 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said.

reut2-000.sgm, SEC STAFF ADVISES FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST WPPSS, The staff of the federal Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to recommend that theWashington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) be charged withsecurities fraud in connection with its July 1983 default on2.25 billion dlrs of bonds, a WPPSS official told Reuters.    WPPSS attorney Ron English said the system was advised bySEC staff attorneys that the five SEC commissioners would beasked to charge WPPSS in connection with its officialstatements about its plans to build its No. 3 and No. 4 nuclearpower plants in the Pacific Northwest at the time it wasselling the bonds.    English, in a telephone interview, said the SEC staffplanned to allege that WPPSS had overstated the demand forpower in the region and had understated the cost of the plants,which were to built with the bonds' proceeds.    English denied the allegations. He said WPPSS had made nopublic forecasts of power demand in connection with the bondsale and had never understated the cost of the plants.    "We at all times told the public everything we knew aboutthe costs," he said.    English said WPPSS had no indication when the SEC mightmeet on the staff's recommendations.    The SEC, as a matter of policy, never comments on itsenforcement activities.    The SEC's WPPSS investigation began in late 1983 and theagency's slow pace on the probe has been publicly criticized onseveral occasions since then by Rep. John Dingell, the MichiganDemocrat who chairs the House panel responsible for the SEC'sbudget and operations.    Of the five nuclear plants originally envisioned by WPPSS,one has been completed, two remain under construction, and twoothers--those for which the defaulted bonds were sold-- havebeen terminated.

reut2-000.sgm, OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OIL MARKET BEING MANIPULATED, OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman accused"oil market manipulators" of drawing down their own stocks andspreading rumours to give the impression OPEC was breaking its15.8 mln barrels per day output ceiling, set last December.    Lukman told reporters the aim was to pull prices below the18 dlrs per barrel reference level set by OPEC.    "People are playing a waiting game to test the will of OPECby drawing down more on their stock than normal, and this ishaving the effect of giving an apparent excess supply on themarket which we know is not real," Lukman said.    Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said that despite probable"minor deviations" by one or two member countries, "basically OPECis producing around what it said it would produce."    After OPEC's price and production accord last December, themarket firmed steadily but spot prices fell in the last week toaround 16 dlrs. Industry reports estimated the organization wasproducing up to one mln bpd above its ceiling during February.    But Lukman was confident OPEC would maintain itsdiscipline, in view of past experience. "We have the experienceof what happened in 1986 behind us, when violations ofagreements led to the collapse of the market," he said.    Lukman was in Kingston as a guest of the state-ownedPetroleum Corp of Jamaica. REUTER&#3;

The first carswould be sold in West Germany, Austria and Switzerland, hesaid.    The European base would be in West Germany, but no finaldecision had been made on other sites.    The company will not set up its own dealer franchises, butintends to work through distributors who will wholesale thevehicles to a franchised dealer organisation.    Lutz commented, "We prefer to export to Europe rather thanmanufacture here because it will allow us to take fullcompetitive advantage of the favourable exchange rates due tothe declining value of the dollar."    The vehicles, on show at this week's Geneva motor show,include Chrysler LeBaron Turbo coupe and convertible, the DodgeLancer ES four-door hatchback, the Dodge Shadow ES compact, thePlymouth Voyager miniwagon and the Dodge Daytona Shelby Z.

reut2-000.sgm, ZIMBABWE'S MAIZE MOUNTAIN POSES ECONOMIC PROBLEM, More than two mln tonnes of surplus maizedotted across Zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economicheadache for the country.    The grain, Southern Africa's staple, has been bought by theGrain Marketing Board (GMB) at prices guaranteed before it wasplanted, and is costing the GMB about 27 mln dlrs a month instorage and interest payments to make the purchases.    Accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests, thesurplus represents about two years of domestic consumption andis set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly.    Some deals have been made with aid donors, such as Europeancountries and Australia, to provide Zimbabwe with wheat inreturn for maize sent to neighbouring Mozambique, where theUnited Nations has urged greater world efforts to feed thehungry.    But transport constraints keep those figures low and theonly significant dent was a sale of 250,000 tonnes to SouthAfrica last year.    Because of the costs it has incurred, the GMB cannot affordto give the maize away and the standard 90 kg bags have beenaccumulating, economists here said.    But failure to find buyers on glutted world grain marketsis damaging Zimbabwe, as it needs foreign exchange to financeimports for other areas of the economy, the economists added.    "At present, it is a no-win situation. Let us hope some ofthe extra aid (UN) Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellarcalled for at the weekend will be spent here," a Western aidspecialist said.    "At least this year's poor rains haven't exacerbated thesituation too badly," he added. Rainfall during the currentrainy season has been far below average, ravaging all but theirrigated lands of large commercial farmers.    While this may curb the amount of maize delivered this yearto the GMB, the government also acted late last year to slashmaize production and force diversification.    Calling for a switch to other crops such as oilseeds,Agriculture Minister Moven Mahachi said an economically-viableprice of 180 dlrs a tonne would be paid this year for only halfthe amount of maize bought by the GMB in 1986, and above thatgrowers would be paid an unprofitable 100 dlrs.    The poor rains have also adversely affected other crops,such as sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts, tobacco and cotton, theAgriculture Ministry reported at the end of February. Reuter&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, TECHNOLOGY/CHIP INDUSTRY SEEKS CUSTOM DESIGNS, U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,struggling to stem a river of red ink, are increasingly lookingtoward customized designs rather than mass-market chips forfuture profits.    The market for customized chips - semiconductors designedfor a very specific application or product - is expected toexpand by 25 to 30 pct this year, compared with only about sixpct for the entire integrated circuit industry.     Market researcher Dataquest Inc estimates that sales ofcustomized chips totaled about 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide lastyear, about 12 pct of the total chip market. By 1990, however,customized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15billion dlr market, about 25 pct of total chip sales.    More important for their vendors, because they are not astandard design customized chips represent a sellers' market,and prices and profit margins can be set accordingly.    High volume memory chips have become "a perfect commoditymarket," Robert Brodersen, a professor of electricalengineering at the University of California at Berkeley, toldan industry forum.    "The product is interchangeable between one manufacturerand another and customers base their buying decisions almostentirely on price," Brodersen said.     He predicted that, in the next few years, only a handful ofthe world's largest chip manufacturers (most of them Japanese)will produce memory chips, the standard electronic componentfound in everything from digital watches to computers. "Therest of the industry just won't be involved."    Last week's International Solid State Circuits Conference,the chip industry's annual forum for new developments, seemedto support Brodersen's prediction.     Of the 116 papers presented at the conference, some 40 pcthad Japanese authors, the first time they have outnumberd theUnited States. Most of the Japanese chip designs were in thememory category, including Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Co'sattention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory(dram) chip, 16 times more powerful than anything nowavailable.    The most advanced memory chip described by a U.S. companywas International Business Machine Corp's &lt;IBM> four mln bitchip, and IBM only manufactures chips for its own internal use,not for the open market.    The problem with memory chips is that they are all based onthe same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copyand inexpensive to manufacture. Because such large Japaneseconglomerates as Sony Corp &lt;SNE>, NEC Corp, &lt;NIPNY> Matushitaand Mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronicsproduct lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market fortheir chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very lowcost per unit.    Customized chips, however, are designed for a specificcustomer, manufactured in small quantities and expensiverelative to standard chips. Computer markets are increasinglylooking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy,thus making the final product harder to clone as well.    Intel Corp &lt;INTC>, the leading manufacturer of themicroprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alertedthe industry to its intention to switch to customized chipslast fall.    The company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said itwill spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itselfinto a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips.    Intel joins some 275 companies already competing for apiece of the customized chip business but it has an advantagethat the others do not. IBM, which owns a 20 pct stake inIntel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000chips it makes for its own use. Intel will customize thosedesigns and sell them to others.    It will also get to use IBM's proprietary computer systemfor designing chips, considered by experts to be one of themost advanced in the world.    Intel's success is still not guaranteed, however. Industryanalysts noted that it is far different to design a mass marketitem than a customized chip that requires a close workingrelationship with the customer.    Intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing itsnewest 30386 microprocessor. A much faster turnarouond time,and much lower development costs, will be required forcustomized chips if the firm is to succeed. Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, CONTINENTAL ILL &lt;CIL> TO RECHARACTERIZE LOSS, Continental Illinois Corp settled anadministrative complaint by the Securities and ExchangeCommission by agreeing to recharacterize 425 mln dlrspreviously reported in the second quarter 1984 as a "loss ofsale on loans."    Under the settlement, which was announced simultaneouslywith the filing of the SEC's administrative action, Continentalagreed to restate earlier financial reports to single out the425 mln dlrs as a separate loan loss item instead of lumping ittogether with another item. The bank holding company said thechange does not affect its operating results for 1984.    The SEC stressed in the complaint that it was notchallenging Continental's reported net loss for the secondquarter of 1984.    But it said it was misleading for the bank to split the 950mln dlr loan loss provision in half, attributing 425 mln dlrsof it to the event of sale.    The 425 mln dlrs should have been part of a 950 mln dlrbillion dlr loan loss provision required by the Office of theComptroller of the Currency, the SEC said.    Continental had originally listed 565 mln dlrs of the loanloss provision as a credit loss and another 425 mln dlrs as aloss on sale of loans, the SEC said.    It was misleading for the bank to list the 425 mln dlrs asloss on sale, which implied the loss would not have occurredhad there not been a sale of distressed loans to the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp, the SEC said.    The bank should have listed 990 mln dlrs as a credit lossinstead of 565 mln dlrs and should not have charecterized theother 425 mln dlrs as a provision for loss on sale of loans,the SEC said.    Continental agreed to the settlement with the SEC withoutadmitting or denying any violations, the SEC said.    But it agreed to restate its 1984 financial statements toaccommodate the SEC's objections and to report to itsshareholders a summarized version of the SEC's administrativeaction against it, the agency said.    A Continental official stressed that the settlement in noway will result in any change or restatement of the company'searnings for that period. Reuter&#3;

"We agree that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke couldbe viewed as a problem by some crew and passengers. However, webelieve that further study is needed before the department canpropose a definitive response to this recommendation," the DOTreport said.    The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) had studied theissue of smoking on airlines under a DOT grant.    It recommended a ban in August after concluding thattobacco smoke, when confined to an airliner's cabin, posedpotential health hazards to cabin crew members, irritated passengers and crew, and created a risk of fires.    The DOT said more study was needed of the health effects ofenvironmental tobacco smoke and of the concentration anddistribution of pollutants on various aircraft types.

AMC spokesman Lloyd Northard told Reuters that the companywill not build its new Jeep ZJ sports utility vehicle at itsKenosha, Wisc., assembly plant as a result of the talks'failure.    "We sincerely regret this outcome, but the responsibilityfor it rests entirely with the local union bargainingcommittees," the company said in a statement.    "We will, therefore, initiate the actions necessary toplace the new Jeep product in an alternative location ratherthan at Kenosha."    UAW officials said during the weekend they did not regardthe collapse of talks as final after the company's "final"proposal on a new contract was unanimously rejected by unionbargainers.    But AMC said the union's rejection of its concessionspackage means that plants in Kenosha and Milwaukee will lose6,500 jobs because the assembly complex in Kenosha "will not begetting new work" as had been proposed with a new contract.    "This unfortunate outcome demonstrates the difficulty ofmaintaining existing working and bringing new work to existingU.S. operations," AMC said.    Asked if the company considered the decision to phase outthe Kenosa plant by 1989 as previously detailed to be final,Northard said: "If the union came to us and said they wouldaccept our final proposal, that's another matter."    But the company charged bargainers for UAW Locals 72 and 75had reneged on commitments for a new agreement with lower laborrates made in 1985 when the union locals negotiated aconcessionary agreement covering AMC's Wisconsin operations.    AMC, which last week reported its first profitable quarterin two years, said it wanted a contract for the plants withlabor rates and work rules comparable to agreements between theUAW and Japanese automakers operating in the U.S.    Wall Street investors reacted to the AMC-UAW impasse bydriving down AMC's stock price.

reut2-000.sgm, GOVERNMENT BOND BROKER SEES WIDER DATA ACCESS, The major U.S. Government bond brokersare likely to give in to pressure from regulators and investorswithin the next 18 months, making their direct-dealing screensavailable to many of those firms that are not now eligible toreceive them, said Richard Lacy, Chairman of Exco InternationalInc.    Earlier today, Exco said it purchased an 80 pct interest inRMJ Holdings Corp, one of the largest of the four bond brokersthat dominate the business.    In a telephone interview, Lacy said "Within 18 months, wethink the number of players will be expanded."    Currently, the four major brokers will sell theirdirect-dealing screens to only primary dealers in U.S.Government securities or those that have applied to the FederalReserve Bank of New york to become a primary dealer.    The U.S. Justice department is looking into whetherlimiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealersis a violation of U.S. Anti-trust laws.    Primary dealers, of which there are now 40, are an elitegroup of firms approved to buy Treasury securities directlyfrom the Fed.    But Lacy said that any agreement to expand access to thebrokers' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not asfar-reaching as some would like. Instead of making screensavailable to any firm willing to pay for one, he said, it ismore likely that a "second tier" will be established.    He also said that RMJ is not willing to break away from thegroup of bond brokers and be the only firm to make its screenswidely available to any one who wants them.    Bond market sources had speculated that RMJ is betterprepared to offer its services nationwide than its three majorcompetitors.    Lacy also said that he does not see any immediate pressurefor a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions anytime soon. In late 1985, transaction fees paid to brokers werecut in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs.    Some U.S. primary bond dealers have been suggesting thatwith further increases in transaction volume, fees can be cutwithout hurting the brokers' profits. REUTER&#3;

Diplomats say the December agreement itself is notthreatened but that its effect could be considerably weakenedif the proposals are altered too radically.    West Germany and Ireland are opposed to proposed limits ona farmer's now automatic right to sell surplus butter intopublic stores when market prices and stocks are high.    Faced with a butter "mountain" of a record 1.2 mln tonnescosting over two mln dlrs per day just to store, EC farmCommissioner Frans Andriessen says farmers must be encouragedto cut production to meet demand.    He is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem beforethe ministers move on to consider this year's annual pricereview which proposes extending the new system for butter salesto other sectors such as cereals.

Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said thelanguage of the message was not totally clear and some believedshipments would be honoured if the traders declare the SovietUnion as the destination of their contracts.    The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the lastweek and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's exportavailability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.    Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediatelyavailable raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets wasprobably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tenderlast month.    Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forwarddelivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in thesale of several cargoes.

On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do nothold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futuresmarket, according to an exchange spokeswoman.    "This will change the way oil is transacted in the realworld," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.    Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEXprices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at adifferential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.     The expanded program "will serve the industry because theoil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza,secretary of Century Resources Inc.     The rule change, which has already taken effect forplatinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the openinterest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according totraders and analysts.    Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, calledan exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures positionbefore entering into the transaction.    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold afutures position before entering into an EFP and one or bothparties can offset their cash transaction with a futurescontract the next day, according to exchange officials.    When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFPprovision will add to globalization of the energy markets byproviding for, in effect, 24-hour trading."

reut2-000.sgm, TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA>, A bidding war for Viacom InternationalInc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted amanagement group and other investors against NationalAmusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A sourceclose to the management side insisted that timing was on hisside. He said if outside directors approve the managementproposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholderswith proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20days from the day we mail," said the source.    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled byinvestor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to completea tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that mustaccompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licensesand cable television franchises.    Redstone was not available for comment.    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a raresituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. Onesaid Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted andif enough people were convinced his proposal was superior tothe Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.    The independent directors of Viacom were called into ameeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. Onemajor Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We thinkwe're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm'sarbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.    Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal wouldcreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. Themanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferredstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with avalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stockstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equityinterest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculatedthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making thetotal package worth 52 dlrs per share.    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeablepreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share ofconvertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portionwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest hewould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyondApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. Theplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pctduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offeredeight pct interest.    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the managementgroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own thecompany," one said. Another said management seemed to have theedge on the timing issue.    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine whatthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. Henoted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, whichadopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititallytraded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is nowjust over 30 dlrs.    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell twotwo cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costsfrom several acquisitions affected results.    Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at37.50 dlrs.

reut2-000.sgm, TALKS SHOW NEW CANADIAN CONFIDENCE, GROUP SAYS, Canada's decision to raise the issueof a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many seeas a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policystudy group said     "It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period,when it was a major player in the process of building a postwarworld," the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.    U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summeraimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries,the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipmentsof about 150 billion dlrs annually.    The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadlineof October for an agreement, are the biggest issue inU.S.-Canadian relations.   The study said liberalized trade between the two countrieswould improve the competitiveness of their economies in worldmarkets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.    The council said "in the past most Canadians have shied awayfrom the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to beoverwhelmed economically and politically by a closerassociation with a country 10 times their size in population."    But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized theirdomestic market was too small to permit the mass production andsales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by anincreasingly competitive world.    The council said that in the talks, Canada is chieflyinterested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports.    A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposedon Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were beingsubsidized.    The council said the chief U.S. concerns included endingcurbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, andthe so-called "cultural industries" - publishing, broadcastingand films.    It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defensecooperation, "acid rain" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadianassertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage. Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, ICI &lt;ICI> SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, thelargest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand itsspecialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and betterits 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson.    "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-addedbusinesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson toldreporters at an informal meeting here.    ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S.drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its StuartPharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its currentpharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990.    Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost inthe way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not."    ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drugmaker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales wereabout 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs,which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits.    He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical divisionwould account for about 30 pct of total company profits.    "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rateof return," said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, whowas also at the meeting.    Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basicallyact as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugsto doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one.    Henderson said the major new products in the company'spipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrsannually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications,Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin,a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.    Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvalto market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensingagreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>, is not expected untilabout 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwinin the U.S. later this year.    Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much.    Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by GliddenPaints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from aunit of Hanson Industries Inc.    Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrsavailable for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that moreacquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out anacquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive."    Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effectiveApril one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones whowill retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing theearnings momentum ICI has established over the past few yearsafter restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would nothelp resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspendedindefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in externaldebt on February 20.    Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour ofEuropean capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debtmoratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improvecapital flows between developed countries and third worlddebtor nations.   Talking before his departure for Paris, he said there couldbe no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity planafter a similar package four years ago "put Brazil in a very bigrecession."    "We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more andimport less. We are not going to go the IMF," he said.    Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following histalks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, saying theU.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as aproblem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks.    Britain also believed an IMF program would help alongnegotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks, thestatement, which banking sources interpreted as an outrightrebuttal of all Brazilian demands, said.    "That was not my impression of the meeting," Funaro said; "Butif the (British) answer is more or less like this, thenthat means nothing is helping to find a solution."    Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week andin Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support tounblock lending from official credit agencies, rather than todeal with Brazils ties with commercial banks.    "Since 1982, all official agencies have been closed to mycountry," he said.    He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil'sefforts. Lawson would officially state his position when thetwo meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank springmeetings in Washington, Funaro said.    Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil'sdebt problem to be resolved, Funaro said Brazil had not come toEurope with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.    "We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme," he said,"We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see whathappens."    Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of currentdomestic economic policies, which Funaro said would likely leadto a five pct economic growth this year.    "Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs andreceived 11 billion ... This is a very big effort," he said."What we have to offer is our cooperation." Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION, All major grain producing countriesmust do their part to help reduce global surpluses and therecent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S.wheat organizations said.    The recent Australian proposals were a good starting pointfor discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feelthey are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on worldgrain trade, the president of the National Association of WheatGrowers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates saidin a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.    Future discussions on international wheat trade shouldinclude three topics -- a commitment to privatization ofgovernment-run export trading entities, a commitment to publicdisclosure of sales and other terms if government entities areinvolved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, thetwo organizations said     While the Australian proposals are welcome the twoorganizations said they are not in total agreement with theirassessments.    Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. targetprices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue toplace the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.farmers, they said.      Other countries, including Australia, have benefittedfrom the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.    "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- andsubsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stockinggrain and changing programs which protect our growers," JimMiller, president of NAWG said.    "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among theworld's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks andrestore profitability to agriculture," Miller said. Reuter&#3;

Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlrtakeover bid for American Medical with several largeshareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass familyof Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated supportone way or the other for his offer, he said.    Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on theconversations he held with shareholders, he could not guagewhether he had majority support. He said, however, there issupport for his offer.    Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he helddiscussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medicalstock.    Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medicalmanagement and other American Medical shareholders.    Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, said it believes a restructuring of AmericanMedical and its business would be "highly desirable andappropriate at this time."    "That's the sort of position that I find a large segment ofshareholders of AMI really share," said Pesch.    Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining histakeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, fourdlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for eachAmerican Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join inan effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would notrule out a future takeover try.    Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposalwith the Bass family.    Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch'stakeover effort and a further sign that there could be someshareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical'sprevious rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer fromPesch.    American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid.Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said amanagement-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.    An American Medical spokesman said the company will commenton the new Pesch offer by March 10.    Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor inthe outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.    The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in AmericanMedical, and the company has previously said the investorssupport management's internal plan to improve the company'sperformance. The Bass family would not comment on AmericanMedical or Pesch.    Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corplast year, continues to face a credibilty problem on WallStreet because of the long time it took to finish the Republicacquisition.    Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wallstreet questioning whether financing can be completed for themuch larger American Medical takeover proposal.    Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made withoutan investment banking firm, another cause for concern to WallStreet. However, Pesch entered his second offer withrepresentation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securitiesand Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.    "I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can beworked out and completed, provided we get to the point whereAmi management will sit down and talk in a friendlyenvironment," Pesch said.    Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financingarrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds inacquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of AmericanMedical management in place.    He said he plans to combine the company with Republic toform an efficient network of hospitals.    Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer couldbe made for American Medical.    Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved secondfiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worthabout 20 dlrs per share.    Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the secondquarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ctloss last year.    Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much morethan the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.    But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transactioncould be completed because of the revised structure of theoffer. "I think it's much more doable," he said.    Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaroundby replacing some members of management and reducing costs. Reuter&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, BRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE, Brazil is not happy with the existingstructure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinatesits commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.    U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committeewhile holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks."The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,however.    Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese andEuropean banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adoptan approach involving separate discussions with the regions.    Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on acase-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply tocreditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.    Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interestpayments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followedlast week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines depositedby foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.    Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week inWashington talking to government officials and internationalagencies and will this week visit Britain, France, WestGermany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions withgovernments.    Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe andGovernor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.    Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.    The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chiefmeans of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharplyand the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in thecountry'rate of inflation.

Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rateclass has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be resetquarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with an 11pct cap.    Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs, this floating-rate class contains aso-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapturepossible lost interest, according to Kidder Peabody.    For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct duringthe life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar,the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs didnot carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said.    Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12.    The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and hasan initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60basis points over three-month LIBOR, with a 13 pct cap. Thistranche does not have a catch-up provision, the Kidder officersaid.    The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has aninitial rate of 10.903 pct. The rate will be reset quarterlyaccording to the formula of 22.44027 minus the product of1.8097 times three-month LIBOR.

In a statement issued by the trade representative's officefollowing a speech to the American Soybean Association's boardof directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severeimpact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billiondlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.    "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its(vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but tovigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access tothe European market," Yeutter said.    Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violateEC obligations under the GATT.    He said the effect of the tax would be to double the priceof soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarinemade from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine,and closer in price to expensive European butter.    "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose sucha provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolvedthe agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC toinclude Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said.

reut2-000.sgm, FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS, French industry is failing to produce thegoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has leftthe government little room for manoeuvre to reflate theeconomy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment said.    With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pctthis year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climbto 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.    The report said the French economy was "increasinglyill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relativeprices on both domestic and export markets."    "France's poor export performance reflects a geographicalbias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18months," it said.    Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficitto around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against thefranc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitivenessrelative not only to the United States but also to the newlyindustrialised countries."    This could result in further major losses of market share,particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost aquarter of French exports, it said.    Until the competitive ability of industry improved, theauthorities would have "little scope for macroeconomicmanoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need toencourage a pickup in investment could require demand to growmore briskly," it added.    But rising unemployment could help to hold down wagedemands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around atwo pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.    Written mainly in December last year, the report took noaccount of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pctsurge in January consumer prices, caused partly by thegovernment's deregulation of service sector tariffs.    "We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provokerunaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet hasbeen lost," one OECD official commented.    OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oilprices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in thereport, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecastto around 2.5 or three pct.    The government last week revised its forecast up to between2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.    But the OECD backed the government's view that theunderlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year'sfall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause ofdisinflation.    With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest inthe OECD area, the inflation differential between France andits main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just onepct this year, it said.    On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices forindustrial goods and private services have been rising steeplyas companies built up their profits.

During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's GiantGroup Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.    It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a LosAngeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on aportion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.    In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mlndlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham LambertInc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of theproceeds to buy TRE stock.    Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly sixpct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.    The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SECwas investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TREholdings were working together without disclosing theircooperation, as would be required by the federal securitieslaws.    One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whetherSugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of itsintended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mlndlr bond offering.    A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unitof Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SECinvestigators and was cooperating with the probe.    The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler hadbeen interviewed by the SEC probers.    A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked forinformation a few months ago as part of an informal probe.    The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agencyand had heard nothing more since that time.    "To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the targetof a formal SEC investigation" in connection with the TRE bid,he said.    A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm hadunderwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:    "We had nothing to do with TRE."    As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines tocomment on its enforcement activities. Reuter&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY, Last week's White House shake-up hasincreased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from thearms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close tothe Fed say.    But they said that no decision on the appointment, whichmust be filled this August, has been taken by the White Houseand Volcker too has not made up his mind.    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, whoresigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named ashis replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and triedoften to undermine him.    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried toensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by PresidentCarter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked astory, quickly shot down by others in the administration, thatBeryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,had been chosen to replace Volcker.    But as the administration's credibility was increasinglyunder fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring aboutsuch changes was on the wane.    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff HowardBaker has a very good relationship with his namesake at theTreasury Department and is likely to respect his views on theFed chairmanship.    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to sharethe right-wing's opposition to Volcker.    "This new White House is going to need all the strength itcan get," said one source when asked about the possibility ofVolcker's reappointment.    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets bothin the United States and around the world. At a time when thestability of the dollar and the viability of major debtornations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitelyundermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with TreasurySecretary Baker on issues like international debt and globaleconomic cooperation.    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulatethe banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, inwhich he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,signalled the politically-independent central bank is comingaround at least partially to the Treasury position.    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration officialthat the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seenas an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker'sreappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointedTreasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure agood working relationship, in part because he believed the twokey government economic institutions have to work closely.    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's firstterm, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firmMerrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America'spre-eminent economic spokesman.    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose politicalskills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets tookmuch more seriously.    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited tostay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stayotherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said StephenAxilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fedand now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is notawe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leavebehind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --the four sitting members were all appointed within the lastthree years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the globaleconomy is threatened by instability.    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem anecessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary ofState George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretaryunder Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economistwould make him ideal.    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iranscandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37years old as too young for the job.    Other potential candidates include economist AlanGreenspan, frequently an informal presidential economicadviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, FederalDeposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged byhis patron's departure from the White House.

reut2-000.sgm, USSR WHEAT BONUS RUMORS PERSIST DESPITE DENIALS, Grain trade representatives continuedto speculate that the Reagan administration will offersubsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. AgricultureDepartment officials said there was no substance to thereports.    "It's pure fiction," said one senior official at USDA'sForeign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that theadministration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscowin the next two to three weeks.    An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked notto be identified said there was nothing to substantiate thespeculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the(wheat) market." Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on thebasis of the speculation.    One lobbyist with close connections to the Reaganadministration said a Soviet trade team told private graintrade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy asmuch as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it beforemid-year, if it was "competitively priced."    Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet tradingorganization, told Reuters he had no information tosubstantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, butsaid that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it wascompetitively priced.

Residential building eased three pct in January, whilecontracts for commercial, industrial and institutionalbuildings rebounded slightly, according to the report.    Nonbuilding construction, which soared to an annualizedrate of 47.8 billion dlrs in December when last year's onlymajor electric power plant was started, fell back 10 pct to43.1 billion.

reut2-000.sgm, EC MINISTERS BID TO SAVE DAIRY ACCORD, European Community (EC) farm ministerswere fighting hard early today to prevent a deal on cuttingoverflowing milk production from turning sour before trying toagree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors.    Meanwhile, protests from angry European farmers oversuccessive attempts to scale down unwanted Community foodproduction appeared to be gathering strength.    In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands ofSpanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand abetter deal from Brussels.    The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pelletsand occupied local government buildings while in the southerncity of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemonson the streets in protest at EC duties.    Towards the end of last week, about 10,000 angry WestGerman farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burningeffigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in Francepig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices.    Europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by theEuropean Commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limitfarmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into publicstores at high guaranteed EC prices.    In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review,at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies, AgricultureCommissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that couldresult in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct.    The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reformsurplus-creating farm policies that have become a politicalembarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad andthreatened to leave the Community with no cash for other areas.    Andriessen's latest package comes only months after adecision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years andto slash beef prices by around 10 pct.    That decision, agreed in outline last December aftervirtually nine days of non-stop negotiations, was hailed as themost significant step yet in the reform offensive, but hassince run into difficulties over the fine print.    West Germany and Ireland are objecting to the new rulesgoverning the sales of surplus butter into cold stores, but theCommission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord hasbeen used as the inspiration for Andriessen's latest package.    Ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem, andresumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details beforestarting the price review which is confidently predicted tolast many months.    EC farm spending currently swallows two thirds of anoverall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almostentirely blamed for a projected budget shortfall later thisyear of some 5.7 billion dlrs.

Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of theguaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the AustralianWheat Board near the start of the season.    The IAC's report will be due at the same time as thefindings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage,Handling and Transport, Kerin said.

reut2-000.sgm, COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL, The failure of the International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotascould trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of atleast 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.    Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.    A special meeting between importing and exporting countriesended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talksover how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discussquotas was set, delegates said.    Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under theInternational Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago afterprices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.    With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producerselling initially and a price war among commercial coffeeroasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.    Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarketshelf this spring, coffee dealers said.    The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer andexporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for thebreakdown of the talks.    Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative anddelegate to the talks, said in a statement after the counciladjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were notprepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objectivecriteria.    "We want to insure that countries receive export quotasbased on their ability to supply the market, instead of theirpolitical influence in the ICO."    Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Daustercountered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried todictate quotas, not negotiate them."    Previously, quotas were determined by historical amountsexported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global marketof about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wantedquotas to continue under this basic scheme.    But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producersproposed carving up the export market on the basis ofexportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil'sshare to 28.8 pct.    Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changesin many countries' export capabilities and make coffee morereadily available to consumers when they need it.    A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largestexporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interimproposal could not bring the two sides together.    Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems,illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments onbank debt, have increased political pressure on the country toprotect its coffee export earnings.    Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavilyon coffee earnings, particularly some African nations andColombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failureto agree quotas, analysts said.    The expected drop in prices could result in losses of asmuch as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegatesforecast.    The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the fullcouncil is not due to meet again until September, delegatessaid. REUTER&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, JAPANESE DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS SEEN RISING, Japanese investor interest in Britishgilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectationssterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, andon calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said.    Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have beenexpanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investorsseeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, whichhave been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said.    Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct hasbeen getting stronger, the general manager of the local officeof a British securities firm said.    On the other hand, major long-term investors such asJapanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic aboutbuying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of theJapanese financial year, traders said.    These investors, who must convert yen into sterling throughdollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buyingin London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a Britishsecurities house said.    The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of230 to 234 late last year.    Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling willfurther appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit fromfurther declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said.    "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds,suggesting further market improvement and continuing demandfrom brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant managerMachiko Suzuki.

reut2-000.sgm, JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT, Japan's unemployment rate is expected tocontinue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year fromJanuary's three pct record, senior economists, including SusumuTaketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since thegovernment's Management and Coordination Agency began compilingstatistics under its current system in 1953.    "There is a general fear that we will become a country withhigh unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist forthe Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.    The government, which published the January unemploymentfigures today, did not make any predictions.    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemploymentrate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situationimproving," a Labour Ministry official said.    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government hadexpected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conferencethe record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budgetwhich has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steeland shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employeesand ceased hiring, economists said.    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed agreat number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo BankLtd's economics department.    However, other economists disagreed, saying the servicesector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by themanufacturing sector over the next five years.    The economists said the service sector should grow as thegovernment stimulates domestic demand under its program totransform the economy away from exports.    Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower thanthose of other industrialised nations, methods for calculatingstatistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.    "The three pct figure  could translate into a relativelyhigh figure if European methods were used," one economist said.More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from ayear earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo'sTsukihara said.

He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textileassociations last Saturday the government could not fix theTaiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due toU.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.    The Federation asked the government on February 19 to holdthe exchange rate at that level.    The federation said in its request that many local textileexporters were operating without profit and would go out ofbusiness if the rate continued to fall.    It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct againstthe U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean wonclimbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollarsremained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period, it said.    Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan's dollarwill rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end.    Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan'sability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year.    The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs incalendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985, official figures show.

A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers toissue certificates to specified trading houses stating they areauthorised exporters.    Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will berequired to show such a certificate, but those without it willnot automatically be denied licences, he said.    But some industry officials predicted any governmentmeasures were likely to have limited effect as long as theworld semiconductor market remained weak.    U.S. Government and industry officials have complainedrepeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at belowcost to third countries despite the July agreement.    Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow ofcheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales bythird-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap betweenlow prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costsand set for Japanese makers under the agreement.    The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey marketis increasing for one specific company, it suggests they aredistributing their products through their sales network knowingthey will be exported by some means. In that case we will askthem what they are doing to reduce the figure."    MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.    But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move.

Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.    Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok BankLtd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relativelyhigh interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market,and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan,contributed to the projected sharp rise.    Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected toexpand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.    A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand couldachieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, upfrom a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.    Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at itscurrent pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stablethe five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.

reut2-000.sgm, NEUTRAL BUDGET EXPECTED IN SINGAPORE, Singapore's Finance Minister RichardHu is expected to announce a neutral budget tomorrow with nomajor tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1,bankers and economists told Reuters.    They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct incalendar 1986, indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pctshrinkage in 1985, the government was likely to hold its courseand wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work.    Last March Hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct,and income tax was reduced by the same margin.    Last year the government also reduced wage costs byintroducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions tothe mandatory state savings scheme, the Central Provident Fund(CPF), to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct.    "I don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because theeconomy is now improving," said Clemente Escano, vice presidentof the Union Bank of Switzerland.    The government's economic report for calendar 1986, issuedlast week, said the CPF reduction and other cost-cuttingmeasures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986.    But the report said over half the economy -- especially thecommerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continuedto be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regionaleconomies and an excess of domestic property.    The sources said the fragility of the economic recoverysuggested the government would not introduce much of itsplanned consumption tax in the coming financial year.    In last year's budget Hu said he planned to set upcollecting machinery for the tax. Economists said a campaignagainst smoking this year might be the opportunity for him tolevy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use.    The sources said the government does not look likely toraise more revenue in this year's budget.    Last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budgetdeficit for fiscal 1986/87, but the economic report projectedan overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion.    Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment incomeand stringent controls on government operating expenditure,helped by the wage-freeze policy.    Anthony K.P. Lee, vice-president and deputy general managerof American Express Bank Ltd, said he expected nothing excitingfrom this year's budget.    Lee said, "It will probably be a non-event as most of thetax benefits were given last year. The economy has alreadystarted moving so it does not need government support."    Last week's economic report attributed the one pct declinein domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline inprivate construction, so this sector hopes for some relief fromthe budget, economists said.    The economic report said the sector's activity declined by25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985.A further decline is expected in 1987.    But in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax forindustrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct untilthe end of 1988, so the most Hu is likely to do is addincentives for creating property investment unit trusts.    The only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget areincentives to encourage population growth, including incentivesto families who have three children.    Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has already announcedthe government will try to encourage three-child families,instead of the two-child families it encourages now. REUTER&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, FISONS SEES STRONG INTERNATIONAL GROWTH IN 1986, Fisons Plc &lt;FISN.L> said stronginternational growth had been the main feature of the group's1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period.    The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, alarger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form ofits Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct.    The company was commenting on 1986 results which sawpre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985.The result was in line with market forecasts, but its sharesnevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from643p.    Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, aswell as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearlyindicated by a strong 1986 performance.    The scientific equipment business had raised the proportionof high technology products it manufactures and also raised itsability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operationshad demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cashflow from all three operations had been positive despite a fullprogramme of capital investment.    Action to protect the group against foreign currencymovements resulted in a small net gain to profits. REUTER&#3;
reut2-000.sgm, PHILIPPINE PLANNING CHIEF URGES PESO DEVALUATION, The Philippines must devalue the peso ifit wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic PlanningSecretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.    "The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exportsmore competitive," Monsod said an interview. "No question aboutit. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, SouthKorea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economiesdeliberately undervalued their currencies."    The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It iscurrently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government doesnot intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible andable to continue to respond to market conditions.    Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate fromthe point of view of finance. "If the dollar rate goes higher,our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so thefinancing is very difficult," she said. "But I am looking at itin terms of the economy."    She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.    "I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it tobecome uncompetitive because then we are dead."    Monsod said, "The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate isa movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates)of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmeticthing."    Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pctin calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it wasexpected to touch five pct this year.    He said the government and the International Monetary Fundhad set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.    The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to thedollar when it was floated in 1984. REUTER&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, JAPANESE FINANCIAL FUTURES PLAN REVEALED, The Federation of Bankers' Associations ofJapan released its proposal for early creation of acomprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo.    The market should include a comprehensive range of futuresand options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real globalmoney centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments isavailable, the proposal said.    It should provide currency and interest rate futures, andincorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stockindex futures contracts.    The proposal said transactions in all these contracts mustbe conducted on the same market so participants can readilyengage in arbitrage between various financial instruments.    To make this possible, the proposal calls for newlegislation which would administer all related futures andoptions transactions under the same legal framework.    Banking sources said they expect that initially thecurrency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures wouldinclude Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit,three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasurybonds.    Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki assaying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possiblebecause it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan'sfinancial markets.    Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospectivemarket participants to banks but was willing to accept thosefrom wider business circles, the sources said.

reut2-000.sgm, JAPAN LIKELY TO LET U.S. BANKS DEAL SECURITIES, Japan looks likely to allow U.S. Banks toconduct securities business here, a move that will probablycause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks frombrokerage houses to break down, financial analysts said.    But the timing of the approval remains uncertain, due toconflicting domestic interests.    J.P.Morgan and Co &lt;JPM>, Bankers Trust New York Corp &lt;BT>,Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and Chemical Bank New YorkCorp &lt;CHL> are expected to win approval to conduct securitiesbusiness in Japan, U.S. Bank officials said.    "There is no reason for extended delay of approval," oneofficial at a U.S. Bank said. The four U.S. Banks have beenseeking finance ministry approval for months.    To date, Japan has allowed European banks to do securitiesbusiness here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries. As Japanesebanks can conduct securities business in European countries,this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way forJapanese banks to enter the domestic securities market.    But if U.S. Banks win approval, Japanese banks will presshard for similiar status, since they are not allowed to conductsecurities business in the U.S.    Many U.S. Bank officials expect their applications to beapproved before June. But Japanese banking sources said thedecision will be delayed until next year. A spokesman for thefinance ministry declined comment.    U.S. Bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks onfinancial market deregulation sometime in the next few months.Ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in Aprilor June.    At the last round of financial negotiations in September,U.S. Officials said Japan's commitment to deregulation wasflagging.    Analysts said the finance ministry has been seriouslyconsidering the U.S. Request since the U.S. Federal ReserveBank of New York approved five new primary governmentsecurities dealers, including two Japanese brokerages, lastDecember.    They said the ministry will have to approve the U.S.Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as opento foreigners as those of the U.S.    Analysts said Japan has proceeded rapidly with financialderegulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the cleardivision between the securities and banking businesses.    Japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard toprotect their interests, but analysts said the banks arefinding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditionalfields.    Officials of major Japanese banks said they will payspecial attention to the ministry's reaction to U.S. Bankrequests because approval would accelerate marketliberalization in Japan.    The Japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way fortheir own entry into the domestic securities market. REUTER&#3;

It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for theyear ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 wasalso aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt andgreater sales of bauxite and aluminium.    Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents pershare final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage ofproposed dividend imputation laws.    This would make five cents for the year against a first andfinal of one cent in 1985.

The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 netearnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, againstanalysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln.    CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend untillater this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputationto its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-freeto shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which thefull 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id.    The company operates on a substituted tax year, not thefiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax atthe 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.    Consequently, it has funds available for distribution withdividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputationlegislation before determining the final payout, it said.    Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a pooryear for the minerals industry, with the notable exception ofgold producers.    Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollarsdeclined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.    Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatilityand uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading tosubstantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.    World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories havesteadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,but overcapacity continues, CRA said.    Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA saidBougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrswhile its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.    Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrsagainst 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.    Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operationsincurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in1985, CRA said.    Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrsagainst 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mlnfrom 2.8 mln.    CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond projectamounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.    CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinaryloss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchangelosses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.    Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided forclosures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase infuture tax provisions, CRA said.    Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrsbefore capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. Thestrong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rightsissue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debtto be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.

reut2-000.sgm, CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S., China called on the United States toremove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable tradingstatus and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 areinaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuadeCongress to change laws which limit its exports.     The official International Business newspaper todaypublished China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with thevisit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.     "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce itsrestrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilitiesfor them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chineseexports," the editorial said.     "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice againstfavourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit Chinainto the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).     "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports inrecent years, control of them is still extremely strict andinfluences normal trade between the two countries," it added     The paper also printed an article by China's commercialcounsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who saidthat "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventingbilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs ontechnology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.     The paper also printed a table showing that, sincebilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit everyyear except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficitsat 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.     A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not acceptPeking's trade figures at all, mainly because they excludegoods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. WhileU.S. Figures are based on country of origin.     He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it willhave to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend severallaws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.     The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs andTrade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not bedominated or controlled by international Communism."     The official said China was well aware of the laws, someof which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but thatthere is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To changethem.     China has been the subject of about a dozen casesinvolving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,which the U.S. Side won, he said.     But, for the first time, China signed last week anagreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrainexports of at least two categories of steel goods, which maylead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.     Another diplomat said willingness to provide suchvoluntary export restraints would be an important issue inbilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.     "China has the potential to disrupt world markets,especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervousabout China in this respect. But there is a precedent for othercentralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said.     Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members ofGATT but none has China's massive market potential for importsor its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.     In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomedChina's interest in participating in GATT.     "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplishedovernight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a largeeconomy of the Chinese type," Shultz said.     "China can play an important role by actively joining GATTdiscussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities andenhance market access for exports worldwide. China can furtherdevelop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximumbenefit from its GATT participation," he said.     The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membershipare similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmenregard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especiallyfor exports, and a de facto dual currency system.     In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATTlast month, China said it was gradually reforming its economicsystem and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidanceplanning" and economic levers.

reut2-000.sgm, NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY, The Bundesbank is unlikely to changeits credit policies at its central bank council meeting onThursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates havestabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.    Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow'stender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds willbe credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining16 billion marks from the system.    The tender was announced last Friday, because carnivalfestivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and willclose banks here this afternoon.    Because of the disruption to business from carnival,minimum reserve figures for the start of the month areunrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess theirneeds at the tender.    Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enoughliquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.    But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marksthis week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.    "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amounta little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.    "They would then stock it up at the next tender when theneed is clearer," he added.    An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billionmarks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporarydrain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.    Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at theBundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, justclear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of Englandoperations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net ofborrowings and repayments.    This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.    The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunityof strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumnand said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.    Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, whilerepayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, aTreasury spokesman said.    Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January,capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuationchange that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to thequarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fundswap.    The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England'smarket operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bankof England intervention to curb upward pressure on the poundtoday.

The sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later todaybetween Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his Westgerman counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg, also believed Brazilshould come up with a convincing economic recovery program.    Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson, who met Funaro yesterday.    Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involvegovernments in negotiations with commercial banks onrescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt, which totals some109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solveits problems with the banks rather than governments.    Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave earlytomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg thisevening.    Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with theIMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to anausterity program with the Fund.    However, the West German banking sources said institutionshere felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented acredible recovery program and that there be a "rapprochement"with the IMF.    "Consultations are the least that can be expected," said onebanker.    Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago tosuspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercialdebt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited byforeign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs.    One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debtnegotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funarofor a change in the structure of the advisory committee ofbanks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982.    Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks, holding 35 pct ofBrazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisorycommittee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazilmight adopt a different approach to its creditor banks,involving separate discussions with the regions.    Such a move would be in Brazil's interest, since Europeanbanks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternativedebt solutions, such as interest capitalisation.    The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regionalapproach, saying: "There must be one committee and one solution."But he added: "There must be an understanding that specialrequests from special regions be taken into account."    German banks had objected to the fact that the idea ofinterest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. Itwas imperative that alternative options be considered. "The menumust become richer," the banker said.    Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involvedin today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank inFrankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented.    West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to theBrazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions inthe United States, because of their lower exposure.    According to Bundesbank data from September last year, WestGerman bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreigncredit. REUTER&#3;

The plan, requiring about 1.7 billion dlrs, now also coverssugar and coconut areas, apart from rice and corn lands, hesaid. It was expected to benefit about three mln landlesspeasants, he added.

These investors, who must convert yen into sterling throughdollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buyingin London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a Britishsecurities house said.    The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of230 to 234 late last year.    Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling willfurther appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit fromfurther declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said.    "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds,suggesting further market improvement and continuing demandfrom brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant managerMachiko Suzuki.    She said she expected the yield on the actively traded11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London. REUTER&#3;

A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler'sUnterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components forDaimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since thebeginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in thestate of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in thestate to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employmore workers.    The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at theUnterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at otherplants but added he was unable to say when this might occur.    A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F], whichis also located in Baden-Wuerttemberg, said he did not thinkPorsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban onovertime by its own works councils.    A strike by IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1984 closeddown the German car industry for about seven weeks as the unionsought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It latersettled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours.    The spokesman said Daimler's total output of cars wascurrently around 2,500 a day. REUTER&#3;

They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after anannouncement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and LandInvestment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of HkHotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.    Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined commenton whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake boughtfrom Liang as long term investment.    He said Evergo "was attracted by the underlying strength ofHk Hotels."    Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possibleredevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best knownhotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned byHk Hotels.    &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.    Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sunon their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.    "It is purely coincidence," he said.    But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergogroup, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may teamup with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.    Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, whichanalysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. MichaelKadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.    Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated tothe Hk Hotels board.    A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family hasnot considered any countermoves so far.    Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and theKadoorie family to cooperate because of different managementstyles.    "Evergo may want to split up the hotel management andproperty developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may notfit the conservative Kadoorie family," said an analyst who askednot to be named.    Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had beendistorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value isonly worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and LaiSun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below thecurrent trading price.    Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo,China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese EstatesLtd>.    Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday,China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs. REUTER&#3;

reut2-000.sgm, REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY, Last week's White House shake-up hasincreased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman PaulVolcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from thearms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close tothe Fed say.    But they said that no decision on the appointment, whichmust be filled this August, has been taken by the White Houseand Volcker too has not made up his mind.    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, whoresigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named ashis replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and triedoften to undermine him.    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried toensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by PresidentCarter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked astory, quickly shot down by others in the administration, thatBeryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,had been chosen to replace Volcker.    But as the administration's credibility was increasinglyunder fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring aboutsuch changes was on the wane.    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff HowardBaker has a very good relationship with his namesake at theTreasury Department and is likely to respect his views on theFed chairmanship.    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to sharethe right-wing's opposition to Volcker.    "This new White House is going to need all the strength itcan get," said one source when asked about the possibility ofVolcker's reappointment.    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets bothin the United States and around the world. At a time when thestability of the dollar and the viability of major debtornations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitelyundermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with TreasurySecretary Baker on issues like international debt and globaleconomic cooperation.    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulatethe banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, inwhich he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,signalled the politically-independent central bank is comingaround at least partially to the Treasury position.    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration officialthat the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seenas an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker'sreappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointedTreasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure agood working relationship, in part because he believed the twokey government economic institutions have to work closely.    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's firstterm, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firmMerrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America'spre-eminent economic spokesman.    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose politicalskills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets tookmuch more seriously.    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited tostay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stayotherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said StephenAxilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fedand now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is notawe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leavebehind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --the four sitting members were all appointed within the lastthree years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the globaleconomy is threatened by instability.    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem anecessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary ofState George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretaryunder Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economistwould make him ideal.    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iranscandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37years old as too young for the job.    Other potential candidates include economist AlanGreenspan, frequently an informal presidential economicadviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, FederalDeposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged byhis patron's departure from the White House.

He said GM will no longer include merit raises in thecalculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sumpayments.  As a result, the merit raises will not be includedin the calculation of pensions and other benefits.

Little progress was made in last night's three hours oftalks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions.    "There is still a very large gap between the employers andthe FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement.But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said.    Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accusedthe FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at allover the past two months.    "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I amreally not optimistic about it changing its point of view atall."    "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses toaccept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector,then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may beginlater this month," Schoufour said.    The series of strikes, which employers say has cost themmore than seven mln guilders in lost import business in thepast six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with350 this year.

"The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to thefailure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but itwill not be long before reality reasserts itself and pricesrise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasterssaid.    "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffeeavailable at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said.    "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following thenews of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again toaround 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added.    Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vriessaid although the roasters were disappointed at the failure ofconsumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quotareintroduction, it was equally important that quotas bereallocated on a more equitable basis.    "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment becausethe market is well balanced and we must not lose thisopportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said.    "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number ofclauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would notwelcome quota reintroduction until we have a completerenegotiation," de Vries added.    With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to havefairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for theforeseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on ahand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market priceswere below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.
