reut2-003.sgm, NYSE RULE COULD AFFECT TRADING IN LONDON, An existing New York Stock Exchange,NYSE, rule might be used to limit the trading activities of itsmembers in London in stocks listed on both exchanges, sourcesat the London Exchange said.    This could arise if the London Stock Exchange goes aheadwith plans to close its trading floor.    The London Exchange sources were commenting on pressreports that the NYSE would bar its members firms from tradingon the London Exchange in interlisted stocks during periodswhen the NYSE was open.    The London exchange is seeking clarification.    London Exchange sources said the possibility ofrestrictions on NYSE members appears to reflect a rule whichrequires that exchanges recognised by the NYSE possess atrading floor.    Last month, the London Exchange said in a statement that itplanned to close its floor in due course, apart from a floorfor traded options, because almost all business is now beingdone by screen and telephone between brokerage offices.    This development stemmed from the Big Bang restructuring ofthe market on October 27. The demise of the traditional StockExchange floor has been widely expected, though no date hasbeen set as yet.    Market sources said a compromise over the NYSE rule couldwell be reached, partly because the interests of U.S.Securities dealers are not all identical.    Some of them could well start lobbying the NYSE, pointingout, among other things, that the expansion of global tradingneeds to be based on reciprocal arrangements.    NYSE brokerage firms which also trade on the LondonExchange would presumably be put at a disadvantage overnon-NYSE U.S. Firms, which  have affiliates on the LondonExchange, market sources said.

The company, in a newspaper advertisement, said it hasstarted a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price,and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, hasunanimously approved the bid.  The offer and withdrawal rightsare to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to befollowed by a merger at the same price.    USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option tobuy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.    USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enoughshares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmonton a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department ofTransportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir tobuy and hold shares pending review of its application to gaincontrol of Piedmont.    The company said its merger agreement with Piedmontprovides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont'sprior written consent in any way that would be adverse toPiedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number ofshares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.    USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares tobe purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum numberneeded to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to besatisfied.    In that case, it said if more than that minimum number ofshares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.    In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share incash for 50 pct of Piedmont's stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAirshares for each remaining Piedmont share.    Last week, Carl C.

reut2-003.sgm, OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987, The 24 nations of the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered bysluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economicgrowth, and their joint balance of payments will swing intodeficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.    The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECDeconomic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a2.8 pct growth forecast in December.    It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and thesmaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardesthit by currency appreciation this year.    The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growthrate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct inDecember and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.    It said it expected the OECD to post a current accountdeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due inlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.    It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely tofall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.    It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlrpayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.    The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomesincreasingly ragged.    It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline inforeign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on itstrade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after lastyear's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rateis expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with anaverage value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.    "This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeperangle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireballrather than a three-point landing," the EIU said.    "Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and theFebruary meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five andCanada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift tomore expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighterU.S. Fsical policy," it said.    It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was thewillingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Governmentassets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.    "Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, addingthat if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollarwould collapse.    To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rateswould have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debtcrisis, it said.    On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look"increasingly sick."    Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seenslowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to4.2 pct in 1988, it said.    The weakness of the West German economy is the biggestsingle factor, with import growth there expected to feature asluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast inDecember, the EIU said.    On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in WestGermany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, whileJapan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, morecompetitively-priced dollar.    It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials andoil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986. Reuter&#3;
reut2-003.sgm, POEHL SAYS FURTHER RATE CUT POSSIBLE - SOURCES, Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehltold a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cutleading interest rates again if the United States makes asimilar move, banking sources said.    The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposiumin Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Pressrepresentatives were not invited.    The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rateswould give room for a matching measure in Germany.    "It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates," saidone banker who attended the symposium.    A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have nocomment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.    But, according to a second source, who also declined to beidentified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as adirect pointer to further moves by the central bank to defendGerman industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.    "He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then theBundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,"the second source said.    In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cutin the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after theU.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting todiscuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made sucha move in advance, the sources said.    Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, bycuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as earlyas last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying,"No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that."    The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nationstook place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.    Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talksbetween central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, sayingthat financial markets had not fully realised the significanceof the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem furtherfalls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.    For the first time all participants at the summit agreedthat a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for allworld economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.    The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boostedgrowing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised aroundcurrent levels by international central bank cooperation.    One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the factthat the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodativein monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown inWest Germany's economic growth.    Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the paststressed that the German central bank had no directresponsibility for growth and was solely concerned withcombatting inflation.    This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tightermonetary stance from the beginning of December until thehalf-point cut in rates in late January.    The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the currentovershooting of the German monetary target would not directlyrespark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to reactimmediately whenever such overshooting occurs.    Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank'smain measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.    Share prices rose in very active trading today, withdealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullishoutlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium,brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

A ministry statistical analysis said while the originalaccord called for payments of 3.82 billion dlrs between 1987and 1989, the new agreement requires debt servicing of 1.35billion over the same period. In 1987, Venezuela will berequired to pay 250 mln dlrs instead of the 1.55 billionoriginally agreed. Payments in 1988 were cut to 400 mln from1.20 billion, and in 1989 to 700 mln from 1.11 billion.    The ministry's analysis said the reduction in debtservicing during 1987-1989 amounts to an effective graceperiod, something the Venezuelan negotiators sought fromcreditor banks but were not granted.

reut2-003.sgm, DUTCH PLANNING AGENCY FORECASTS LOWER GROWTH, Dutch economic growth is slowing as afirming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industriesreduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planningagency CPB said.    The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economicoutlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected togrow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.    Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increasefrom last year's 423.95 billion.    The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value ofthe guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pctlast year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an averageof 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.    "The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unitlabour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, whilethese are rising slightly in the Netherlands," the CPB said.    More of economic growth now depended on domesticconsumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins setby domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect onpurchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.    Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, theCPB said. Inflation was zero last year.    Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by fivepct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth lastyear, the CPB said.    Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue tocondition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recentyears, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact ofthese factors on Dutch competitiveness.    In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and socialsecurity costs to employers.    The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring downthe deficit and reduce tax and social security payments infuture.    Dutch government revenue is being depressed further byfalling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.    It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 thisyear from 710,000 last year.    While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB iswithin its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to twopct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.    Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said inits February economic outlook that GDP growth at constantprices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analystshad expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its ownlatest estimate.    "It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the wholedocument yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in someof our estimates," a Pierson economist said.

The company also said it will receive a qualified opinionfrom the auditors of it 1986 financial statement subject to theoutcome of two suits. The company is a defendant in aconsolidated class action law suit which seeks damages in anunspecified amount and is also a defendant in a relatedshareholder action.    Iomega said the auditors state in their opinion letter thatboth actions are in the early stages of discovery and thelikely outcome can not be determined at this time.    The company said a corporate wide reduction of itsprofessional, management and indirect labor will result in thepermanent elimination of 183 positions in all functional areasof the company's business.

reut2-003.sgm, TECHNOLOGY/NEW ERA FOR INFORMATION HANDLING, Ground-breaking new systems for storingand retrieving information are ushering in a new era forcomputer companies and computer users.    Within the past few weeks, International Business MachinesCorp &lt;IBM>, Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK> and others have launchedproducts that radically increase the amount of data that can becatalogued and shelved in computerized libraries.    "This flurry of new technology could yield systems thathandle a multimedia blitz of data," said Ian Warhaftig, asenior analyst with International Data Corp, Framingham, Mass.    "We're developing new systems because our customers areasking for them," Peter Giles, vice president and generalmanager of Kodak's mass memory division, said in a recentinterview.    This demand is expected to soar in coming years. Whileestimates vary, industry analysts project that providingproducts and services geared for information storage andretrieval could become a 20 billion dlr a year business by1995.    A wide range of technologies will be needed to meet thevarying requirements of users.    For example, a large credit verification service would wanta system from which it could quickly retrieve credit data andrelay it to its clients. A law firm, however, may need acomputerized law library in which capacity, rather than speed,is the key feature. For architects and engineers, the abilityto store photographs, sketches and other graphics would becrucial.    Regardless of the specific application, the trend is towardconverting information - documents, video or film or even soundrecordings - into to the digital language of zeros and onesunderstood by computers.    Saving space is the key goal in digitizing data forstorage. An optical disk the size of a standard compact diskcan store 550 megabytes of data, or about 250,000 pages oftypewritten text.    For this reason, the compact disk read-only memory, orCD-ROM, is already a popular data storage media. Last week,Microsoft introduced Microsoft Bookshelf, a 300 dlr programthat contains, on a single CD-ROM disk, a dictionary,thesaurus, national ZIP code directory, Bartlett's FamiliarQuotations, the World Almanac and other reference works.    Scores of such products are already on the market, but mostare specialty items, such as Lotus Development Corp's &lt;LOTS>CD-ROM data base of stock information for financial analystsand investors. "Microsoft Bookshelf is important because itmarks the arrival of CD-ROM packages for the general public,"said Ian Warhaftig of International Data Corp.    One drawback of the CD-ROM, which uses a laser to recordand read data, is that that it requires a special player.CD-ROM players for the retail market will appear later thisyear.    Moreover, IDC's Warhaftig said CD-ROM's will be integratedwith personal computers.    "Eventually, CD-ROM's will fit right inside the PC box," hesaid. "Imagine the advantage of having a spelling checker andthesaurus at your fingertips when you're writing with a wordprocessing program."    But CD-ROM's are just the beginning. Also last week, Kodakunveiled several systems that use 12-inch optical disks. Thelargest Kodak system uses a jukebox-like cabinet to hold up to150 optical disks from which data can be retrieved in a matterof seconds.    Kodak also announced a 14-inch optical disk with 6.8gigabytes of memory, five times the memory of a CD-ROM. TheKodak disk, which will not be available until the middle of1988, is designed for users who need quick access to very largeamounts of data, said Kodak's Giles.    Meanwhile, N.V. Philips &lt;PGLO.AS>, the Dutch electronicsgiant, is preparing to take optical disk technology a stepfurther with the first disk that can combine text, video andsound. Philips said the system, called Called CD-Interactive,will be ready next year. It will include a new kind of CD-ROMplayer that can hook up with a television set and stereo.     Additional breakthroughs are expected as the nextgeneration of computer memory chips are introduced. Last monthIBM said it has made a four-megabyte chip, capable of storingmore data than eight CD-ROM's. Meantime, &lt;Nippon Telegraph andTelephone> of Japan said it has built a 16-megabyte chip.    Analysts say commercial versions of these chips are severalyears away, though some suspect that IBM may start volumeproduction of its four-megabyte chip sometime this year.    Such chips will enable computer makers to build computerswith immense memory capacities. Reuter&#3;

The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,started on February 27, and union leaders said they would notreturn to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipownershave offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.    "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off theworkers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with ourprotest until the end," a union leader said. more    He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marinestake over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels andlet the marines handle the situation by themselves.    A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order tosend marines to take over the ports was given by Navy MinisterHenrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of nationalsecurity. But he said there were no incidents. The strike hascut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.    Petrol station owners in four states also continued theirshutdown and there were fears that the combination of the twostoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage. Reuter&#3;
reut2-003.sgm, BANKING TRADE GROUP SAYS BANK PROFITS DOWN, The American Bankers Association saidthe profitability of the nation's commercial banks declined by12 pct during the first three quarters of 1986.    During the first nine months of last year, the industry'sannualized rate of return on assets dropped to 0.68 pct from0.77 pct in the same period in 1985, the ABA said. Return onequity fell to 10.8 pct from 12.3 pct the previous year.    Despite the decline in profits, the ABA said banks' capitalgrew boosting the industry's capital ratio to 6.4 pct from 6.3pct.    The number and size of banks losing money during the periodincreased significantly, the ABA said.    During the first nine months of 1986, 17.5 pct of banks,holding 9.6 pct of banking assets, were unprofitable, the groupsaid. That compares with 13 pct of banks, holding 8.8 pct ofassets, during the same period in 1985, it said.

reut2-003.sgm, PAPER INSTITUTE SEES STRONG PAPER MARKET IN '87, The American Paper Institute said theindustry is headed for another year of record volume in 1987,with linerboard particularly strong.    "A pro-growth trade policy, continued attention to currencymanagement, a fairly low interest rate climate and no major taxincreases are the essential ingredients in this outlook," RedCavaney, American Paper Institute president said.    Cavaney said that so far this year the industry'sperformance mimics last year's strength.    Last year, he said, paper and paperboard production hit arecord 71 mln tons, 5.9 pct above 1985's 67 mln tons, whileindustry after-tax profits in 1986 exceeded 1985 profits.    Cavaney said that inventories will play a major role inthis year's performance.    "Inventories, which are generally low, are a positivefactor in the industry's outlook this year," he said, citingmarket pulp stocks, which are currently at 21 days supply, atthe low end of the industry's long term average.    Cavaney added that as a result of slimmer inventories in1986 and in the early part of this year, shipments for 1987 asa whole will be higher than last year, even if demand slackens.    Cavaney said, however, he expects demand this year to bestrong, spurred by consumer spending.    The benefits of tax reform on individual after-tax incomeand consumer goods companies' cash flow, he said, will increasedemand for both communications paper and packaging this year.    In addition, Cavaney said low mortgage rates should supporthigh levels of housing starts in 1987, increasing demand formany kinds of packaged goods.    Inventory building should help demand for cartons andcorrugated containers this year, he added.    Cavaney said he expects exports to remain fairly high in1987, as well, as a result of the recent declines in the dollaragainst major world currencies.    But more importantly, he said, an improved balance of tradein 1987 from the lower dollar would induce increased industrialactivity at home and thus higher packaging demand.    Cavaney said increased competitiveness, caused by lowercosts, higher productivity and improved efficiency would alsocontribute to a strong showing from the industry this year.    Cavaney said, however, that the Tax Reform Act of 1986could have a negative impact on the industry this year.    "For manufacturers, the removal of the investment taxcredit creates an impediment to future investment," he said.    Also, he said API estimates the industry will lose threebillion dlrs in cash flow over a five year period as a resultof reforms.    "Adjustments to this loss will require time and carefulevaluation and will adversely affect the capital spendingdecisions of individual companies," Cavaney said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-003.sgm, BONN SERIOUS ABOUT CURRENCY PACT, SAYS TIETMEYER, West Germany takes "very seriously" therecent undertaking by major industrial countries to promoteexchange rate stability around current levels, Finance MinistryState Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.    Talking to journalists before a meeting of EuropeanCommunity Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyerdeclined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by theGroup of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreementsfor stabilising currencies.    But he noted the official communique said the participantsagreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchangerates around current levels. "We're taking this sentence veryseriously," he said.    Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved againstthe mark since the meeting.    He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had beencaused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Parisagreement should help in this respect.    Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said theBonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster theeconomy but was paying close attention to the slower growth andhad not ruled out "appropriate and timely" action if necessary.    Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussionby the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on theeconomic situation in the 12-nation bloc.    The Commission has sharply revised down expected Germangross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pctpredicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any ECcountry to stimulate economic activity.    Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowedin the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend inview that would make quick remedial action necessary.    He said a number of favourable indicators such as highlevel of investment and a good climate for consumption meant arecovery could be expected, while exports would pick upslightly during the course of the year.

reut2-003.sgm, UGANDA DISAPPOINTED BY COFFEE TALKS FAILURE, Uganda, Africa's second largest coffeeproducer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffeetalks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee MarketingBoard, CMB, said.    "This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in asituation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne ofrobusta coffee," J. Makumbi said when he returned from London onFriday.    Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formulato share the world's coffee production during InternationalCoffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week.    Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which weresuspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that itsquota be increased dramatically.    Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually fromcoffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings --had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.    The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to overthree mln bags.    For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICOexport quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.    The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties forabout 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employsover half of salaried manpower.    In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's Agriculture and LivestockDevelopment Minister Paul Bomani said today Third Worldcountries would suffer from the failure of the London coffeetalks.

reut2-003.sgm, ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL, The suspension of Ecuador's crude oilshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last atleast four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.    The official said Ecuador could resume exports afterrepairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which linksjungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to thepipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oilaccounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as60 pct of government revenues.    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisationof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumpingabout 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpdabove the output quota assigned by the cartel, another EnergyMinistry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombianpipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could takeabout 60 days to build.    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the endof January, about equal to one month's imports.    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billiondlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country'stotal foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest inLatin America.    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela wouldloan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next threemonths to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic suppliesand would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela inrepayment in May, Lusinchi said.

reut2-003.sgm, SOUTHERN &lt;SO> TO TAKE CHARGE ON VOGTLE COST, Southern Co said it will take anafter-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later thanJanuary 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclearpower plant has risen abover the amount which retail customersin Georgia will be asked to pay.    The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, saidthe budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mlndlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the madelast year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increasedcost will not be included in the utility's retail electricrates.    Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduledcompletion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.    The utility said fuel loading has been completed at UnitOne and the unit is being put through a series of low-powertests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for afull-power license.    The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., isco-owned by &lt;Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal ElectricAuthority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.    Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate wasdue to several factors, including additional labor costsincurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule forcommercial operation by June. The new figure represents thefirst change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when itwas estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.    In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would"cap" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to payat 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Powersaid, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.    Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a chargeagainst earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.    In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contractswith the joint owners require the utility to buy backsignificant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant'sinitial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, itwill not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increasethat applies to the buybacks.    This bings the total amount that must be charged againstearnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.    Southern said new rules of the Financial AccountingStandards Board, which are effective in January 1988, requireany costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be chargedagainst earnings once that determination is made.    The company also said its board has approved a capitalbudget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on theVogtle project.    It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-yearperiod 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, notingthis is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years1986-1988.

reut2-003.sgm, OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987, The 24 nations of the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered bysluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economicgrowth, and their joint balance of payments will swing intodeficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.    The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECDeconomic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a2.8 pct growth forecast in December.    It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and thesmaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardesthit by currency appreciation this year.    The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growthrate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct inDecember and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.    It said it expected the OECD to post a current accountdeficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due inlarge part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.    It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely tofall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.    It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlrpayments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.    The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomesincreasingly ragged.    It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline inforeign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on itstrade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after lastyear's 18.4 pct drop.    The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this yearand 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to breakthrough the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.    "This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angleof descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball ratherthan a three-point landing," the EIU said.    "Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and theFebruary meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five andCanada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift tomore expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighterU.S. Fiscal policy," it said.    It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was thewillingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Governmentassets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.    "Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, adding thatif Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar wouldcollapse.    To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rateswould have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debtcrisis, it said.    On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look "increasinglysick."    Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seenslowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to4.2 pct in 1988, it said.    The weakness of the West German economy is the biggestsingle factor, with import growth there expected to feature asluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast inDecember, the EIU said.    On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in WestGermany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, whileJapan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, morecompetitively-priced dollar.    It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials andoil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.    However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to overthe current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity priceswill show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the firsttime since 1984, the EIU said.    After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price ofinternationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.    It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986. Reuter&#3;

reut2-003.sgm, STUDY SAYS U.S., CANADA PACT WOULD SPUR ECONOMIES, A free trade pact between the UnitedStates and Canada could spur the economies of both sidessubstantially, according to a study released by the Institutefor International Economics.    The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusionto the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada'sgross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S.export's by about seven pct.    He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue ofgovernment subsidies, end curbs on trade in services andinvestments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The United States and Canada - the world's two biggesttrading partners with cross border shipments of about 150billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. Theyare aiming for a pact by next October.    Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity ofMaryland, said an agreement should include:    - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phasedin over a five to 10-year period;    - Equal access to federal government procurement in the twocountries, replacing current "Buy America" and "Buy Canada"provisions with a "Buy North America" provision;    - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly financeand transportation;    - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favordomestic producers;    - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.     Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, thetwo sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.    The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.    He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offsetsubsidies should go first a special disputes commission forresolution at an early stage.    Wonnacott said "bilateral free trade would contribute to theefficiency of the North American economies and to theircompetitiveness in facing overseas producers.    He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadiangoods and enable them to benefit from the economies of massproduction.    Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those toCanada proportionately, he said, because of the already largeU.S. gross national product.    Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areasas export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commissioncould set an example for the current attempt by GATT to writenew and more liberal global trading regulations.

The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pctand will be available for dealings from March 11, with theremainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said thebonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be freeof tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 "B."  A further 100 mln stg wasreserved for the National Debt Commissioners.    The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank'sannouncement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20minutes after the news.    Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against thebackdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rateswhich had built up over the past two weeks as a result ofsterling's strength.    The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared tosee lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoonannounced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11pct.    The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a ratecut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delaya reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.    However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorableclimb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure andallow a half-point cut.    Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the marketas a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further earlyrate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.    Most market participants believe that Lawson will nowfoster a further half point interest rate reduction at the timeof the budget, although one or two said they would not besurprised to see a full point decline at this stage.    Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attemptslast week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issueda one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing theGovernment bond market.    To the surprise of most participants, the issue was soldout within hours of becoming available for trading and themarket pushed on to register further sharp gains.    Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that theissue announced today would be absorbed by the market asrapidly as last week's.    However, they noted that although sterling had edged downfrom its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closedon a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300GMT.

reut2-003.sgm, PAPER SAYS POINDEXTER MAY LINK REAGAN TO FUNDS, President Reagan's denial that heknew proceeds from Iran arms sales were diverted to Nicaraguancontra rebels might be challenged by his former nationalsecurity adviser, according to the Washington Post.    The paper said yesterday that John Poindexter, who resignedlast November when the illegal transfer of up to 20 mln dlrswas disclosed, was ready to break the silence he has so farmaintained over the affair.    The Post said he might tell a special Senate committeeinvestigating the Iran scandal that he told Reagan twice in1986 that money from Iran sales was being used for aid to thecontras.    It said the panel was considering granting Poindexterimmunity from prosecution over the fund diversion, which wasillegal under a Congressional ban in force at the time againstaid for the contras.    Poindexter has so far invoked the Fifth Amendment to theConstitution which protects people from giving evidence whichcould be self-incriminating.    Reagan has said he authorized the sale of arms to Iran inthe hope of establishing links with Iranian moderates, but hasdenied knowing that proceeds were ending up in Nicaraguan rebelhands.    A White House spokesman had no comment on the Post story,but David Abshire, who is coordinating White House handling ofthe affair, said Reagan would never approve any illegal action.    Abshire, on the CBS television show "Face the Nation," didnot comment directly on the Post story, but said: "He (Reagan)is deeply honest, he is deeply dedicated, he tells the truthand when he says he has no knowledge, he has no knowledge."    The Post quoted a source close to Reagan as saying theWhite House expected Poindexter "will say he had direction andauthority, directly or indirectly," from the president for thediversion of funds.    The paper said the former security adviser's testimonycould damage the president's claim he was unaware of the fundsdiversion.    It quoted a legal source as saying Poindexter and hislawyers planned to contend that twice in 1986 he told Reaganthat the arms sales were generating money for the "contras."    The paper quoted the source as saying Poindexter did nottell Reagan there was an illegal diversion of funds, but thathelp for the contras was "an ancillary benefit" of the sales.    The Post's sources also said the Senate committee couldgrant immunity from prosecution this month to Oliver North, whowas fired from the National Security Council on the same daythat Poindexter resigned.

Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering workshould put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a developmentplan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.    Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production asearly as 1991, Petro-Canada said.    "We have a high degree of confidence that the westernportion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mlncubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,and that we could produce it economicly using a floatingproduction system," Petro-Canada said.    The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, wasdiscovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.    "We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion ofthe field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove upadditional reserves there," the company said.    Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercialprospect and the company wants to move some of those resourcestowards development so it can start generating a return oninvestments, Petro-Canada said.    Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block ofthe Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's EastFlank block, a company spokesman said later. Other fieldparticipants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, TrilliumExploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.    Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field'sGraven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil,company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgaryoffice.    Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's EastFlank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels,he added.    Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrsto bring the field to production by about 1991, and thedevelopment budget could double if the company builds aproduction system combining both blocks in the field, he said.    Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven blockwould produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average dailyproduction, with a production system that would have maximumcapacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said inanswer to a query.

reut2-003.sgm, UK MONEY RATES FALL AS BANK APPROVES BASE RATE CUT, A half point cut in base lending rateswas announced by the big four clearing banks today after theBank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks ofdownward pressure, dealers said.    During its routine intervention in the market, the banktrimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses byhalf a point and National Westminster led the other clearingbanks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct.    The timing of the Bank of England move took operators bysurprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampenhopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.       For some time, fundamentals haveled the market to push for a one point cut in base lendingrates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to followwholesale money market rates down.    Although political considerations -- the government's wishto see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- hadbeen suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank'sdelaying action, worries about the real strength of sterlingand perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of theBudget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealerssaid.    In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut,leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.    Consequently, rates in the money market eased during theday, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.    Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated ataround 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at theend of last week.

reut2-003.sgm, U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - S/P CUT HAS NO EFFECT, In an unusual move, Standard and Poor'sCorp downgraded a U.S. corporate debt issue soon after it waspriced for offering late last week.    But, unlike a similar action in September 1986, whichinvestment bankers said disrupted the financing, the agency'srate reduction had no effect this time, traders said.    S and P announced Friday afternoon that it cut to B fromB-plus a 900 mln dlr issue of senior notes due 1994 of HolidayInns Inc, a unit of Holiday Corp &lt;HIA>. The notes were pricedlate Thursday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    In a release, Standard and Poor's said the action reflecteda change in the note issue's terms to an unsecured form of debtfrom secured. That change was made after the agency rated thenotes on February 20, S and P stated.    "We took action as we became aware that the issue'sstructure had changed," said Robert Nelson of S and P. "Wegenerally make a distinction between secured and unsecureddebt, and this was the key factor in our downgrade."    A spokesman for Drexel said the action did not affect theHoliday Inns deal, which had already sold out to investors bylate Friday afternoon.    "The Holiday notes are trading at 100.50 on a when-issuedbasis," the Drexel spokesman said soon after S and P'sannouncement. The 10-1/2 pct notes had been priced at par.    That is a far cry from late September, when S and Pdowngraded a 215 mln dlr issue of subordinated sinking funddebentures due 1998 of New World Pictures Ltd &lt;NWP> just hoursafter the pricing. Because of the rating cut to CCC-plus fromB-minus, the underwriter halted sales and repriced the issue.    Sole manager L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin initiallygave the debentures a 12-1/4 pct coupon and par pricing. Itthen repriced the issue at 97 to yield 12.74 pct.    New World Pictures had increased the issue to 215 mln dlrsfrom an original offering of 150 mln dlrs, and that brought inS and P. The agency cited the larger financing in its actionand said it believed the issuer's cash from existing operationswould not be enough to adequately service debt.    An officer with S and P said at the time the rating agencywas not told beforehand that the issue had been increased insize. Usually, issuers and underwriters alert the ratingagencies to any changes in debt offerings, he said.    In both cases, Moody's Investors Service Inc declined tofollow suit, bond traders noted.    Indeed, Moody's announced Friday that its original ratingof B-1 for the Holiday Inns notes remained appropriate.    Moody's pointed out that while the seven-year notes wouldbe unsecured obligations of Holiday Inns, the issue wouldbenefit from a negative pledge provision and a call forspecified collateral under certain circumstances.    The agency also said the B-1 rating continued to recognizea highly leveraged debt structure that would result fromHoliday's recapitalization program, as well as the company'sdependence on property sales to produce adequate cash flow fornear-term debt service.    "Aside from Holiday Inns and New World Pictures, I cannotremember the last time an issue was downgraded so soon afterthe pricing," remarked one corporate bond trader.    Holiday Inns also sold Thursday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs ofsubordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and parpricing. The debentures' ratings of B-2 by Moody's and B-minusby S and P were left unchanged on Friday.    The combined offering of 1.4 billion dlrs was thesecond-largest junk bond deal ever brought to market,underwriters and traders said. They said the biggest was BCIHoldings' 2.35 billion dlr offering on April 10, 1986.    That the Holiday Inns deal sold out quickly underscored theappetite of many investors for high-yield securities.    "People are hungry for yield. They are not worried aboutdownside risk at all, especially for junk bonds issued bywell-known companies," said one portfolio manager.    As a result, investors are expected to snap up this week'splanned offerings by Allied Stores Corp of 200 mln dlrs ofsenior notes due 1992, rated B-2/B, and 600 mln dlrs of seniorsubordinated debentures due 1997, rated B-3/CCC-plus.    Lead underwriter First Boston Corp said Friday it hastentatively scheduled the securities for pricing today. Reuter&#3;

The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today.    Analysts said the market is anticipating a downwardrevision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted.    The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged sinceOctober, should be affected this time by recent evidence of ashortfall in the early and midseason crop now that thoseharvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDAprojections, the harvests should have been five to seven mlnboxes larger than they were.    "They are going to cut their estimate," said Bob Tate, anFCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. "The onlyquestion is whether they will admit the whole thing in thisestimate."    Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimateby a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue todrop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop pictureclarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly ofValencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted.    "They'll temper it," said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst withShearson Lehman Bros. "The main drop will probably come inJuly."    She expects today's estimate will be 126 mln boxes. Reuter&#3;

The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed todayunder the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD), is scheduled to last until March 20.    Xuto told delegates this session of the conferencepresented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but ithad to be the last before the current accord expires inOctober.    Xuto said in his consultations with representatives ofmajor exporting and importing countries over the last fewmonths, "I have found a constructive attitude and willingness tobe flexible on the part of all concerned."    "It is imperative that we try to settle the majoroutstanding issues in the course of this week, since aconsiderable amount of technical drafting work will remain tobe completed." He said he will immediately start consultationswith producers and consumers.    The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreementover buffer stock operations.    Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimedat preventing INRA from following the collapse of theInternational Tin Agreement (ITA), were rejected by producerswho argued for unchanged INRA terms.    The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran outof funds to support prices.    Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers andconsumers for a new five-year pact ended without agreement. TheINRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended toOctober 1987 to facilitate renegotiation.    Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said hewas cautiously optimistic "that together we should be able tosave INRA and prevent it from being scuttled."

reut2-003.sgm, GERMAN BANKS SAY COMPANY HOLDINGS FALLING, West German private banks, in thelatest twist in a long-running battle over the size of theirholdings in industry, have said the holdings were falling andrejected calls for tighter limits on these participations.    Under West Germany's banking system, banks can hold sharesin non-banking companies giving them seats on companysupervisory boards, and administer the holdings of smallshareholders in safe custody accounts.    Holdings of over 25 pct, which give a veto right in thesupervisory board of a company, must be disclosed.    "The claim that the concentration of power has intensified,as made by the Monopolies Commission, therefore turns out notto be accurate ... There is no reason to impose further legalrestrictions on the acquisition of holdings by banks," it said.    The Association's letter is the latest skirmish in a longrunning battle between banks on the one hand and a range ofgovernment offices and political lobbies on the left and right.    The number of holdings above 10 pct in public companieswith a nominal share capital of over one mln marks held bythese 10 banks fell to 86 in 1986 from 129 in 1976, it said.    Of these 43 reductions, 41 represented holdings of over 25pct in 1976. The banks' holdings of nominal share capital fellto 1.70 billion marks in 1986, or 1.34 billion adjusted forcapital changes in the past 10 years from 1.80 billion in 1976.    Over this period total West German nominal share capitalrose to 235 billion marks from 136 billion, so that the holdingof banks in German companies fell to 0.7 pct from 1.3 pct.    The nominal share capital of listed non-bank companies roseto an estimated 49 billion marks in 1986 from 35.58 billion in1976, with banks' holdings falling to 1.57 billion marks or 3.2pct from 1.61 billion marks or 4.5 pct, the Association said.    It argued that bank representatives were in a minority onthe supervisory boards of the 100 biggest German companies, andin most cases could be blocked by non-banking representatives.    The survey covered Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F>, Dresdner BankAG &lt;DRSD.F>, Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F>, Bayerische Vereinsbank AG&lt;BVMG.F> and Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank AG&lt;BHWG.F>.    It also covered Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank&lt;BHFG.F>, &lt;Berliner Bank AG>, &lt;Industriekreditbank AG>,Vereins- und Westbank AG &lt;VHBG.F> and &lt;Baden-WuerttembergischeBank AG>.    Deutsche holds by far the largest number of such stakes,including 28.5 pct of Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F>.    Criticism of the bank holdings has not only come from theMonopolies Commission and left-wing parties. An advisorycommission, in a report late last year to the EconomicsMinistry, urged implementation of the five pct proposed by theMonopolies Commission to promote competition and avoid interestconflicts.    The Economics Ministry has been controlled by the liberalFree Democrat Party, junior partner in the centre-rightcoalition government and increasingly in favour ofderegulation.    Furthermore the West German Supreme Court recentlysupported an action by a private Deutsche shareholder demandingmore transparency in the bank's balance sheet.    The shareholder argued that the bank's ability to declareindustrial stakes of more than 25 pct as only temporaryholdings evaded the statutory requirement to report them infull. If a bank declares stakes temporary it does not have todisclose them but can include them under securities holdings.    The case is due to be heard again by the Frankfurt higherregional court.

reut2-003.sgm, WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR, The World Bank intends to bringborrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because itexpects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bankvice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.    He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. "The weightof opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higherprobability there will be one pct higher than one pct lowerinterest rates," he said.    The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so farthis year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.    The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at alevel that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where andhow much to borrow, Rotberg said.    Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years'anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstandingdebt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.    Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, itdid not intend to launch new financial instruments just for thesake of innovation, Rotberg said.    Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only someeight billion had been swapped into another currency.    Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors orunfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident thatthis was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.    The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed overthe next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out newinstruments such as bonds with warrants.    The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germanysince the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.&#3;

It could take weeks before the extent of the compensationclaims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also beforeit was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged,said David Larner of Lloyds.    The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprisewere valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by TownsendThoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental SteamNavigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>.

These were alsounderwritten by Lloyds and other companies.

Shipping sources said, however, that these claims couldsoar if a court found there was negligence or design faultsinvolved.

The offer, which came amid warning strikes by some 33,000workers, was the first time since World War Two that employershave proposed cutting working hours and is seen as averting arepeat of the nationwide strike of 1984 which brought the autoindustry to a standstill for seven weeks, union sources said.    The employers propose a half-hour cut in the 38.5 hourworking week from July 1, 1988 and a pay rise of 2.7 pct fromApril 1 and a further 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.

It called today's warning strikes, mostly involving workstoppages of up to one hour, after more than 50 rounds of talkssince December failed.

"There's been rumors that they've taken a position in thecompany, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau.    Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and CrownBooks, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire SafewayStores INc.    The company later reached an accord under which it wouldbuy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed itsleveraged buyout of the company.    The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mlnto 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts.     Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment.    Jerry Ballan, analyst with Conner Ballan division of EdwardViner and Co, said, "They &lt;Dart> has been rumored to be buyingsome other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop."    "My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to bebought out," said Ballan.    Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facingproblems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations,which might make it difficult to thwart a bid.    Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrsa share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on apost stock split basis.    For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company willearn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and shouldearn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987.    "But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due toPurity Supreme in New England," Comeau said.    He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated inthat area and that the company has had difficulty withintegrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations.    Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due tothe state of that industry, and has reported lower returns asan operating unit, according to analysts.    Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General itwould probably divest the company's operations.

The SOMC, a group of basically "monetarist" privateeconomists, said that "economic growth will accelerate in 1987in response to powerful stimulative actions by the FederalReserve."    The group said the Fed's actions have been excessive. As aresult, it said that "inflation and ultimately anotherrecession now loom on the horizon."    The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely onprogressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not leadto sustainable economic growth and stable prices.    The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic orinflation growth in its policy statement. However, theCommittee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it wasbasically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is amember of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.    Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentagepoint higher than in the past two years. He expects consumerprices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.    The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has beena principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costlyinflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to "abandonits inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetarybase on the path toward sustained lower inflation."    The Fed in February said it would no longer target thenarrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 andeconomic growth has been largely severed.&#3;

Earlier today, theofficial planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus tofall to six billion guilders during 1987.

"I think someone else will probably come in, or they (MTS)will have to raise their bid," said Marvin Roffman, an analystat Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.    MTS, a company formed by Martin Sosnoff, Caesars World'slargest shareholder, today began a tender offer, valued at725.2 mln dlrs, for all shares Sosnoff doesn't already own.    "I think the offer is too low by at least five points,"said Roffman, who described Caesars World as the operator of"one of the finest casinos in the world."    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct ofCaesars World's 30.3 mln shares.    Following news of the tender offer Caesars World's shareswere trading at 27-7/8, up 3-3/8.    A Caesars World spokesman said the company was decliningcomment on the Sosnoff move for the moment, but Caesars mayissue a public statement after it has studied the offer.    Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growthpotential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of twodlrs per share.    Caesars World owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoonresorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controlsCaesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN>, which owns an Atlantic City,N.J., casino hotel.

reut2-003.sgm, USX &lt;X> CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR LOWER DOLLAR, USX Corp chairman David Roderick calledfor a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currenciesto help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, whichlast year reached 170 billion dlrs.    In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Clubof Detroit, Roderick said, "There should be total resolve thatthe dollar versus other major currencies, as well as thecurrencies of other nations having a substantial trade surpluswith us, must continue to decline so that the correction in ourtrade deficit starts on the road to recovery."    Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the"economic pain" our trading partners experience as a result ofa falling dollar.    But, he added, "As painful as the correction may be to ourtrading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problemuncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable,lengthy and steep world recession."    Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 thedollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against majorindustrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broadergroup of currencies of nearly all developing nations.    At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets inthe U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had asurplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said thedata were provided by economic consultants to USX.    The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pctrise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although otherfactors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said,"to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmentaldeterioration of U.S. productivity or of American productquality."    These areas need to be improved but they are not the rootcause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urgedAmerican manufacturers to become more competitive so they cancompete in global markets.    In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes insecurities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporateraiders and speculators.    Among his proposals, which he presented to the SenateBanking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirementthat raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stockthey acquire in a company.    Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for allcash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders berequired to have financing in place before a tender is made.    Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cashtender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company'sstock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferentialprice by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, shouldbe prohibited under the revised laws.    Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses butthat he did not want laws that would hurt the financial marketsor discourage "fair price to all" takeovers. Reuter&#3;

reut2-003.sgm, PRIMARY EUROSTERLING MARKET BOOMS DESPITE RATE CUT, Two new eurosterling bonds were launchedtoday, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far thismonth, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling marketfueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria.    The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut inbanks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said thishad been largely discounted and was not likely to detract fromthe current popularity of sterling-denominated investments.    "Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month andwe're set to see many more eurosterling deals," one dealer said.    Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stgdeal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead byBaring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertibledeal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. "Wethought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 wehad last month but it seems March will beat February hands downwith 10 already," one eurosterling specialist said.    "Optically, psychologically, these single figures are muchmore attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like acheap and attractive way to raise your money," he added.    This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who havetapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as theKingdom of Sweden today, continental banks includingCommerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations.    Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the currentvogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers lastmonth to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields.    A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed atSwiss and German investors who were showing good interest.    This is the first entry into the long term internationalcapital markets by Storehouse, British designer TerenceConran's retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chainstores Mothercare, British Home Stores and Habitat.

reut2-003.sgm, MCDONNELL &lt;MD> SAID TALKS AT INFORMAL STAGE, McDonnell Douglas Corp said recent talkswith Airbus Industries about joint development and productionof a new jetliner with the European aircraft manufacturingconsortium have been very informal.    "If there have been talks, they were casual at best," saida source at the company. "There is nothing going on that wouldlead to immediate or near-term collaboration" on a new plane.    Senior officials at the aerospace firm's St. Louisheadquarters were unable to comment more specifically onweekend published reports from Europe that talks about a jointventure have resumed after they broke off last fall.    McDonnell Douglas and Airbus last spring and summer haddiscussed jointly developing and building a long-range aircraftto compete with Boeing Co &lt;BA> 747 wide-body jetliner, or itssuccessor. Talks ended when neither side wanted to forego plansto launch its own widebody jetliner projects - McDonnellDouglas with its MD-11 and Airbus with its A340.    McDonnell Douglas has since launched the MD-11 jetliner, asuccessor to its DC-10, and has more than 100 orders andoptions.    Airbus wants to launch its program this spring and is nowseeking customers for the long-range A340 and a companionplane, the shorter-range A330.    "I don't want to say we're not interested, because we arein any collaboration that benefits McDonnell Douglas without itgiving up anything," the source told Reuters. "There justhaven't been in-depth discussions."    He said any joint venture would not affect the MD-11program already underway.    McDonnell Douglas last month claimed Airbus tried tooverturn pledges made by airlines to buy the MD-11 by offeringcut-rate prices for the A340.    The firm said Airbus, in an effort to line up enoughcustomers to launch the program, is engaging in "predatorypractices" with prices substantially below those needed torecover the cost of developing and building the plane.    U.S. government and aerospace industry officials believeAirbus can offer low prices because the consortium getsgovernment subsidies that cover many of its costs.    The Reagan Administration decided last month to consult theGeneral Agreement on Tariff and Trade, GATT, to determinewhether Airbus is unfairly subsidized. Under GATT rules anenterprise can be subsidized but only if it will make a profit.    U.S. officials say Airbus countries have poured 15 billiondlrs into Airbus since the early 1970's and the consortium hasyet to make a profit. Reuter&#3;

EdwardZorinsky (D-Neb.), Midwestern grain farmers have lost an allywho from his senior post on the Senate Agriculture Committeehad fought hard against cutbacks in farm benefits.    Zorinsky's passing could trim the Democrats' majority inthe Senate and change the makeup of the Senate farm panel.    Zorinsky, who died of a heart attack last Friday, was thesecond-ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee andchairman of the crucial subcommittee on agricultural productionand stabilization of prices.    Once a Republican, Zorinsky was fiscal conservative. But hewas an outspoken critic of Reagan administration proposals totrim target prices, and at the time of his death was girdinghimself for another push for mandatory supply controls.    If Melcher decides, however, to continue as chairman of thesubcommittee on agricultural research, conservation, forestryand general legislation, other Democrats would have a crack atthe vacated chairmanship.    By order of seniority, those senators would be David Pryor(Ark.), David Boren (Okla.), Howell Heflin (Ala.) and TomHarkin (D-Iowa), a forceful advocate of mandatory supplycontrols. Reuter&#3;

Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available tofeed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments forthe 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated theywant to do the same for feedgrains.    Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corndeficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final paymentmust be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.    However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs ofdeficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs,doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.    Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitationfrom the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another hugerelease of certs onto the market.    Bills are pending in Congress to move up the finalfeedgrain deficiency payment to "as soon as five months afterharvest as possible," rather than the current year lag time.    Neither Rep.

reut2-003.sgm, USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE, The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.    In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA saidthe increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to theU.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat andcoarse grain from other major suppliers.    USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up onemln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below thepreliminary 1985/86 figure.    Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mlntonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along witha dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and acold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.    USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightlyfrom the previous January's level, while milk productionincreased by nearly six pct.    Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases inroughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestockproduction from expanding as much as it did a year earlier,USDA said. Reuter&#3;

They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipelineat 150 mln dlrs.    "the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake isgigantic," president leon febres cordero said after inspectingthe damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 milesfrom here.    The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing thisopec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, presidentfebres cordero said in a statement issued today by thepresidential press office.    The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crudeexports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. Itwould cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carriesoil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacificocean port.    Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds ofecuador's exports.    the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico riverwhich burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napoprovince, health minister jorge brancho told reuters.    "we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there isno way of now knowing the exact figure because many people havedisappeared," he said.    Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead.    So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said.    Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters: "the numberof dead and injured is not known ... because we do not know howmany people lived in the homes hit by the landslides."    Bracho said at least 15,000 were left homeless in thecayambe district. Reuter&#3;

Warburg (USA) Inc and formerpresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon saidwithout elaboration that he expects a "significant decline inthe dollar," within the next three years.    "The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficitwill stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,"he said.    Solomon described the structural core as about one-half ofthe current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited severalfactors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.    For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any newinvestment in those manufacturing industries that shrank whenthe dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.    In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increasedpropensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.

The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks agocut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.    It said economic prospects had been less promising over thepast few months because of a sharp fall in the value of thedollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which wouldrestrain Community exports.    But diplomats said several member states, led by WestGermany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy,especially since it was drafted before a recent agreementbetween the leading Western economic powers to stabilisecurrencies around current levels.    "Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rathertoo pessimistic," said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens,who chaired the meeting.

George Gould, Under Secretary of the Treasury, told a WallStreet Planning Group luncheon, "legislation is not going tohappen before the election ... (people) do not like to vote oncontroversial issues in election years."    "It may take a while in the next administration ... to getsomething done," he added.    Calls for a major overhaul of the U.S. banking industry,which would probably feature wider investment banking powersfor commercial banks, has met strong opposition from privateinterest groups, such as the Securities Industry Association.    "These discussions have nothing to do with merit ... thesegroups are trying to cloak self-interest in public policyterms," Gould said. "It is easier to stop something than it isto get it going."    He also described current concern about insider trading as"a major impediment to further progress ... it is not a helpfulbackdrop to accomplish financial reform."    Similarly, Gould said lobbying by such groups as the U.S.League of Savings Institutions would probably mean that theReagan Administration's proposal for the recapitalization ofthe Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp would be watereddown.

The Imperial Government of China issued bonds in 1911 tohelp construct a section of the so-called Hukuang railroad inan agreement with British, German, French and American banks.    According to court documents, payments on the loan weremade until the mid-1930s, when China was torn by civil war. Thepresent government, which came to power in 1949, has neveracknowledged the debt.     Nine U.S. bondholders sued China for repayment of the loanin 1979, less than a year after the normalization of relationsbetween Washington and Peking.    A U.S. District Court in Alabama in 1982 issued a judgmentthat the bondholders were entitled to all unpaid interest andprincipal on the bonds, totaling 41.3 mln dlrs.    But a U.S. Court of Appeals last July vacated the award,ruling that the Chinese government was entitled to sovereignimmunity, and dismissed the lawsuit.    Supported by the Reagan administration, China argued thatit could not be held liable for a debts involving bonds issuedin 1911 and that it enjoyed absolute immunity.    The Supreme Court, without comment, declined to hear anappeal by the bondholders seeking to reinstate their lawsuit. Reuter&#3;

reut2-003.sgm, CBT DISCUSSES MAJOR CHANGES FOR RENOVATION, Chicago Board of Trade (CBT)agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for aperiod of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goesahead with planned renovation.    A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at anumber of options to identify the most cost effective andefficient way to proceed, including one which would involvemoving the entire grains floor out of the building and into thenearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.    "One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items hasbeen to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room,"the spokesman said.    Another CBT official, executive vice president GeorgeSladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at aspecial meeting on the exchange floor.    A number of presentations have been made with regard torenovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. "We'velooked at five or six different alternatives, involving suchthings as flip-flopping the trading rooms," he added.    It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, wemight use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBTmarkets, Sladoje said.    "If we move out of one floor entirely, then theconstruction period will be about a year," he said, adding thatthe issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and thenbe on the drawing board for eight months to a year.    The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were verypreliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin untilthis summer at the earliest.    In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits,exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporaryhome next door in the present grains-dominated area.    This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bondfutures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds andT-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing theMidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat,soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options.    Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBTmembers.    One senior floor trader said the financial futures roombadly needs renovating.    "There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm andthe financials will move to the grains area," he said.    The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed wasto renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at atime. "The first step, after deciding the most effective way toproceed, would be to get architectural and engineeringdrawings," he said.    He added that it was difficult at present to determine anexact time frame for any possible moves. "This is a majorundertaking and a process that would spread out over nextyear," he said.    Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, whichmerged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparingto vacate their floor at the end of this month.    Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT bymoving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reservedfor lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now sharetheir trading area.    The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains,livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well assome options contracts.

reut2-003.sgm, CHRYSLER &lt;C> AMC BUYOUT VALUED AT 1.55 BILLION, Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition ofAmerican Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs inAmerican Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.    They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.    The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefingChrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company'sagreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mlndlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is notincluded valuing the transaction.    Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposedpurchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected thetransaction would carry with it a short-term dilution inChrysler's earnings.    A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, toldReuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than itwould have been had a deal been struck last year because theimpact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability toassume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwardsaccumulated from its losses since 1980.    "There were very serious discussions last fall but wedidn't pull it off," the source said in a reference to theassassination in November of former Renault chairman GeorgesBesse.    "It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd doneit before the end of last year."    In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, thesource said Chrysler would also assume any liability fromlawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called "an overhangto the company."    Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them thatthe deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principalin the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mlndlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25mln dlrs in cash for "transaction fees" in connection with theacquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paidAMC shareholders.    "The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,"analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.     Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.     But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC'sliabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMCdebt that is being carried at "non-market" rates.    He said there were difficulties in negotiating with theprevious Renault management on the acquisition because theywere committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was anintegral part.    "The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn'ttheir baby," he said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-003.sgm, BANKS TO MULL PHILIPPINE DEBT PROPOSAL, The Philippines' bank advisorycommittee meets tomorrow to discuss its response to a novelproposal by finance minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of thecountry's interest bill with investment notes instead of cash,bankers said.    Ongpin outlined his plan today to the 12-bank advisorycommittee headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.    Bankers declined to comment on today's meeting but said thepanel's response could be crucial to the fate of the talks,which are now in their second week. "The ball's in our courtnow," one banker on the committee said.    Under Ongpin's rescheduling plan, the Philippines wouldoffer to make interest payments in cash at 5/8 pct over theLondon Interbank Offered Rate.    Banks which found this rate unacceptably low would beoffered an alternative of LIBOR payments in cash plus a marginof one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes, PINs,bankers explained.    These tradable, dollar-denominated zero-coupon notes wouldhave a maturity of six years, but they would be redeemable atany time at par for pesos to fund investments approved as partof the government's debt-equity scheme.    Because banks would be able to sell the PINs tomultinational investors at relatively small discounts to facevalue, their total yield would be boosted well above the 5/8pct cash margin, according to the Philippine proposal.    Although bankers are eager to foster foreign investment inthe Philippines, the PINs idea is likely to run into stiffresistance by at least some members of the bank advisorycommittee because it would establish the precedent of someinterest payments being made with paper rather than cash.    Ongpin has said that U.S. regulators and accountants hadgiven a green light to his idea, but bankers are not so sure.    U.S. bankers fear that they would not be able to accountfor the notes in the same way as accruing cash interestpayments and that their profits would suffer accordingly.    If the banks reject the proposal out of hand, however, theyrun the risk of scuttling the talks, for Ongpin has insistedthat he would not accept a margin above 5/8 pct.    The Phillipines is asking the banks to reschedule 3.6billion dlrs of debt falling due between 1987 and 1992 and togrant easier terms on 5.8 billion dlrs of previouslyrestructured debt. Reuter&#3;

Under the law, which is designed to combat the spread ofnuclear weapons, foreign importers of U.S. nuclear fuel mustget American consent to any reprocessing.    The United States and EURATOM have had a series of 11rounds of talks from 1978 to 1986 to renegotiate its nuclearcooperation agreements, signed more than 20 years ago, toconform with the 1978 law.

reut2-003.sgm, FUTURE OF EC BUTTER DISPOSAL SCHEME IN DOUBT, A 3.6 billion dlr plan to rid theEuropean Community (EC) of one mln tonnes of surplus butter isin doubt as Spain and Portugal refuse to drop their oppositionto the scheme, diplomats said.    The plan, proposed by the Community's executive Commission,aims to level most of the EC's huge and costly butter mountainby disposing of a total of 1.04 mln tonnes this year and next.    But the officials said Spain and Portugal, which joined the12-nation bloc at the beginning of last year, continued tooppose the scheme at a meeting of EC finance ministers here.    They argued they should not have to pay for the disposal ofsurpluses created before they became EC members.    The plan, already approved by farm ministers despiteopposition from Madrid and Lisbon, had been sent to financeministers for final approval.    But the diplomats said the finance ministers insteadreferred it back to the Commission, asking it to study possibleways to solve the row as soon as possible.    They said Spain and Portugal indicated they may go to theEuropean Court of Justice over the issue if the Commission didnot come up with a satisfactory solution.    The scheme has also run into criticism from the EC'sfinancial watchdog, the Court of Auditors.    The Court has said the plan is unsound because theCommission wants member states to foot the bill until it startsreimbursing them in four annual instalments from 1989.    Diplomats said Spain and Portugal backed the court's viewand also complained that, under complex financial agreementsworked out when they joined the EC, they would get less backlater than if they were reimbursed now.    Commission sources said it appeared the two countries wereholding out in a bid to squeeze some form of compensation outof their partners but it was unclear how much longer they wouldcontinue to block the scheme.

reut2-003.sgm, WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN, A confidential World Bank report on thePeruvian economy has said the government's strategy does notoffer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and islikely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure.    The report, published today by the economic monthly, ThePeru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia'sgovernment in stimulating output last year to achieve a growthin gross domestic product of over eight pct "represents gains inthe short term at the expense of the long."    Government officials had no immediate comment on thereport, which advised a reduction in the overall size of thepublic investment program and greater emphasis on thepreservation of Peru's export potential.    The report said that although the government had succeededin cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivationprogram was encountering rising difficulties.    "An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked tomonetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing ofprice controls, appears not improbable," it added.    The world bank report said the government's policies hadreduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption atthe apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of thecurrency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses,and sharply diminished creditworthiness.    It said unless the government took action quickly to fix acompetitive exchange rate and control the public sectordeficit, "the higher the probability will be that the governmentwill eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment ofdomestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still furthercontrols on imports in order to stem inflation and support thebalance of payments."    It said the bank would place more emphasis on thepreservation of peru's export potential, external links andoverall economic efficiency.    The government's incentive policies towards the mining andpetroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports,suggested that it did not accord high priority to theireconomic viability, it added.

Lindner, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controlsAmerican Financial Corp, said his talks with some of Taft'smanagers and directors have been aimed at "achieving anincreased ownership position" in the company.    Lindner said his increase in ownership would be made eitherby making an offer to acquire control of Taft or taking part ina group to acquire the company.    Lindner, who holds his Taft stake through AmericanFinancial and its subsidiaries, said he is also consideringbuying more Taft stock on the open market or in private deals.    He did not say whether the talks with Taft officials led toany agreements or understandings.    But Lindner said he intends to review his investment inTaft and may be involved in further talks or take other stepsregarding the future control and direction of Taft.

Although he recently received clearance from the FederalTrade Commission to raise his stake in the company to 24.9 pct,Lindner in previous SEC filings has always stressed that hisinterest in Taft was for investment only and not was notseeking to control the company.    An investor group headed by members of the wealthy Bassfamily of Fort Worth, Texas, also holds about 24.9 pct ofTaft's common stock. Reuter&#3;

reut2-003.sgm, U.S. INTERVENED TO AID DLR IN JANUARY, FED SAYS, U.S. authorities intervened in theforeign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasionduring the period between the start of November 1986 and theend of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in areport.    The Fed's quarterly review of foreign exchange operationssaid that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yenon January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanesemonetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and theU.S. Treasury.    The Fed's intervention was on the morning after presidentReagan's State of the Union message and was "in a mannerconsistent with the joint statement" made by U.S. Treasurysecretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister KiichiMiyazawa after their January 21 consultations.    At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness tocooperate on exchange rate issues.    The Fed's report did not say at what level the interventionoccurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yenafter dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. Ithad closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day.    The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 markson January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks.    The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughoutNovember and the first half of December, the dollar movedsharply lower until the end of January.    It closed the three-month review period down more than 11pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies andseven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallenfour pct against the Canadian dollar.    During the final days of January, pressure on the dollarsubsided. Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operationand talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrialcountries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation onexchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said.    Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S.interest rates. The dollar's swift fall had raised questionsabout whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease.    Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marksand 153.70 yen. According to the Fed's trade-weighted index, ithad declined nine pct since the beginning of the period.    The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen inearly November.    The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market onNovember 7, 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worthof marks and yen.    The Fed's action followed the September 1985 Plazaagreement between the five major industrial nations under whichthey agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar. Reuter&#3;

reut2-003.sgm, USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT, The Soviet Union will likely honorits commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of fourmln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Departmentofficial said.    "They have always honoured the agreement, and there's noreason now to think they won't this year," he told Reuters.    "They have an aggressive buying campaign from the EuropeanCommunity, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyersfrom all sources at this point," the official said inexplaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain importsestimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.    This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago whenanalysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn forthe first time in 15 years.    A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concernover Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow'srecent interest.    Lower corn production prospects in some major supplyingcountries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, theofficial said.    "The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists"and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. "Assoon as they need corn, they'll buy it," he added.    USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to theSoviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said thepurchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.    The USDA official would not speculate on when the Sovietswould enter the U.S. market again.    "There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from thesituation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one offrenetic buying now," the official said.    However, the situation in wheat is "a different story," hesaid. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchasecommitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Sovietpurchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.    Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer tothe Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation. Reuter&#3;

reut2-003.sgm, AUSTRALIAN WAGE RISE SET AT 10 DLRS A WEEK, The Arbitration Commission awardedthe Australian workforce a flat 10 dlrs a week wage increaseand allowed trade unions to begin bargaining for a second-tierincrease of up to four pct, Commission President Justice BarryMaddern said here.    The decision is effective from the next pay period ofindividual employers, he said in delivering the Commission'sNational Wage Case decision.    Full-time adult ordinary time weekly earnings are 453.00dlrs a week for males and 428.40 dlrs for all adults, accordingto latest official statistics.    The wage decision is the first under the previouslyannounced two-tier system which replaced the concept of wageindexation. It is the first national wage rise since apartially-indexed increase of 2.3 pct was awarded by theCommission last July.    The decision is a compromise between the Federalgovernment's call at the Wage Case hearing for a 10 dlr weeklyrise plus a three pct second-tier ceiling and the AustralianCouncil of Trade Unions' (ACTU) claim of 20 dlrs and up to fourpct.    Employer groups had sought no rise at all.    The Commission is willing to convene another Wage Case inOctober to establish if another wage increase of up to 1.5 pctshould be awarded, Maddern said.    He said the success of the new system depended on thecommitment of all parties - employers, unions and governments.    He said the Commission had rejected employers' calls for afreeze on overall labour cost increases.    "We do not think that such an outcome is feasible, given theneeds and expectations of wage and salary earners,' he said,adding a freeze could have destroyed the possibility of acooperative effort to lift Australia's economic performance.    The decision would ensure the effects of the depreciationof the Australian dollar and the adverse terms of trade wouldnot be reflected in wage increases, Maddern said.    If necessary, it would arbitrate second-tier claims at animplementation rate of no more than two pct from September thisyear and a further two pct from July 1988, he said.    He said labour cost rises would be phased in over the lifeof the package, adding that second-tier rises will be mainlyachieved by a restructuring and efficiency principle, coveringelimination of restrictive work practices, improved efficiencyand productivity and reduction of demarcation disputes.    Maddern said the Commission again ruled out claims for acut in weekly working hours below 38 and allowed employers tobe exempted from wage case decisions on the basis of severe orextreme economic adversity.    The Commission said the poor economic outlook noted in itslast decision had persisted, and was perhaps now more serious.    "The prevailing uncertainty and lack of confidence in theeconomy which underlines the economic circumstances must beallayed to halt further decline and to turn the economy around.In this connection, what happens to labour costs is of criticalimportance," he said.

Dlrs in the December quarter from 33.42 billion inSeptember, although the government's share rose to 21.32billion from 20.75 billion.    Douglas said in a statement this was due to the boosting ofreserves to refinance so-called "Think Big" projects.    "These reserves do not add to New Zealand's totalindebtedness.... They are money in the bank," he said.    "As negotiations to refinance each Think Big project arecompleted, existing loans will be replaced with debt currentlyheld in reserves for this purpose," Douglas added.    This in turn will result in a drop in quasi-government andprivate debt, he said.    He said refinancing of projects allowed the government toborrow on more favourable terms and to manage Think Big debtsmore effectively.

Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be savedand must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protectionand Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute ofMalaysia (RRIM), told Reuters.    He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenespora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may causeoutput to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.    The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institutemay ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by thedisease and added that most estates affected belong to theState Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.    Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affectscertain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and thatfurther use of such clones must be discontinued.    Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber ResearchInstitute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444,2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said.    Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbedafter use of such clones were discontinued.    Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which alsoaffects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experiencehas proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added.    "The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is notcurbed in the two affected countries their rubber output maydrop and prices can rise," he said.

A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which wereloaded on trucks in the ship's hold have been recovered, butBelgian authorities warned it was essential to recover afurther 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution.    A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at thefront of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out.    Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside thewreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now liespartly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour.    The ferry's owner is &lt;European Ferries Plc>, majority ownedby Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>.    The operation to right the vessel began yesterday afterdivers abandoned their search for more bodies. Experts said itcould take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodiesestimated to be trapped amid debris.    "The problem is that in these waters you can normally expectone working day out of four," said Daan Kaakebeen of DutchSalvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam. Heestimated the job itself would require 35 working days.    Using reinforced cables, salvage experts intend to raisethe ship and set it down into a trench dug alongside.    Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss ofthe ferry, one of three sister vessels plying cross-Channelroutes from England to continental Europe.    Suspicion at present is focused on the ferry's main vehicleloading doors, set close to water level.    In London, Transport Secretary John Moore told parliamentyesterday that the ship keeled over after water gushed inthrough the bow doors.

Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, anagent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told aU.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few itemsthat western nations want.    But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods andallowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encouragemodest export gains in future.    Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth ofgoods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billiondlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.

reut2-003.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS, Japanese microchip makers are beingstrong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact onsemiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan'smarket to foreign chips, industry analysts said.    But doubts remain over whether the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuringthe firms, can successfully battle market forces and whetherthe U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of anybreathing space, they said.    U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last Septemberhave pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanesechipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.    "MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industryto get things done," said Bache Securities (Japan) associatevice president Peter Wolffe.    Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for theJanuary to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensivechips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subjectto the pact's price controls.    The ministry also asked electronics firms to providedistributors with certificates designating them as authorisedexporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which greymarketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.    U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was injeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American marketsand little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.    But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to theproduction cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corpsaid it would cut production in line with MITI's request.    "NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI'sdemands," said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. "OnceNEC cuts production, it means they all have."    Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanesefirms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales thatthe Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.    "The best way to lower cost is to produce more," said SalomonBrothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.    Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could alsospur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst MattAizawa said.    Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any newrestrictions, some industry officials said.    "It's like tax avoidance schemes," said Steve Donovan, headof MMI Japan K.K. "As soon as you close one route, anotheropens."    MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earliershrugged off MITI guidance.    "It's getting to be like communism," said one.    But analysts said output cuts could help by making iteasier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcingfirms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.    "They're going to have to start running their businesseslike businesses," Bache's Wolffe said.    MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaignurging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industryofficials said response has been mixed at best.    "There has been some change, but it's not across the board,"said one U.S. Spokesman. "The companies have a varying degree ofurgency."    The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on thetroubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.    Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamicrandom access memory) chips could merely speed the transitionto one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.    Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memorychips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, theysaid.    Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing themost advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.    Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.    "The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn'teven have an office here," a source close to the industry said."You could question just how committed they are."    In addition, some industry analysts question theeffectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out thirdcountry chipmakers such as those in South Korea.    "(South) Korea's gaining market share," said one analyst."They're the real winners from the agreement." REUTER&#3;

His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the televisionnews agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will maketo Britain later this month.    King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be preparedto reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mlnbarrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark priceagreed to by OPEC last December.    The King replied: "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices byitself but certainly desires price stability."    Non-OPEC countries "must help us in a framework of commoninterest so that there is no type of competition which couldprove harmful to everyone," he said.    Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a firststep towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was notfor Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine suchissues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higherbenchmark.    In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure,due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahdsaid Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, wasadhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference whichset a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.

The striking price was a partly paid41 stg pct, at which price bids were allotted 53.8 pct.    Dealers noted that strong demand had been detected for thebonds yesterday afternoon and interest was further stimulatedby sterling's surge at the opening this morning.    The issue was announced on Monday, when it was widely seenas a move by the authorities to brake market optimism for afurther U.K. Interest rate reduction following the half-pointcut in clearing bank base lending rates to 10.5 pct earlier inthe day.    Dealers said that the Bank's strategy succeeded in stemmingpressure for a further rate reduction only briefly, as themarket yesterday recovered all the ground it lost on Mondayimmediately after the announcement.    Demand for the issue was lively from U.K. And overseassources, with particular interest seen from Japan.    The bonds were issued at a price of 96-16/32 stg pct,partly paid as to 40 stg pct on application, although theGovernment broker this morning sold them at a premium of onestg pct over the partly paid issue price.    The issue has been designated the "B" tranche of the bonds,since 1.3 billion stg of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997is already in issue.    Dealers noted that the Bank of England last week issued onebillion stg of nine pct Exchequer bonds due 2002 in an effortto dampen enthusiasm for an interest rate reduction caused bysterling's uptrend on foreign exchange markets.    Last week's issue was sold out on its first day of dealingsbut with nothing resembling the determined demand seen thismorning for the new tranche of bonds, dealers said.    After stifling pressure for a rate cut last week, theauthorities finally sanctioned a base rate reduction on Monday,following it up with the announcement of the one billion stgbond issue.    Sterling was briefly depressed by the rate cut but thismorning opened very strongly again, starting on atrade-weighted basis at 72.6 against yesterday's final 72.1 andlater edging up to 72.7.    U.K. Money market rates declined again this morning by upto 1/8 point, strongly reinforcing yesterday's speculation thatclearing bank base lending rates could drop into single figuresafter the budget next Tuesday, money market dealers said.    U.K. Government bond dealers noted that under the influenceof stronger sterling and the further fall in money marketrates, prices this morning had opened as much as 3/4 pointhigher at the longer end of the market.

reut2-003.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP, China's foreign debt reached 27 billiondlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure toshort-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains verycreditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreignbankers and Chinese officials told Reuters.    Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply froman estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increasedimport commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low,between eight and 10 pct.    China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.    Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relationsand Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loanagreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.    Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs inthe 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers saidthey estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.    A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too muchshort-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as aresult of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractivelow interest rates in the Japanese market.    The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and islikely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.    A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of thecountry's total debt at about 30 pct.    The Peking representative of a Japanese securities housesaid the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.    "Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China,which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to goelsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread," hesaid.    The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans isin part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capitalmarkets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.    "Officials do not think of China but of their own departmentor firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have thefull backing of the People's Republic of China," he said.    "The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in otherareas, is to balance central control with giving reasonableautonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms toexercise indirect controls," he said.    The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over thepast six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not beaffected by a drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrasemeaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal ofCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.    A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China'sforeign exchange reserves have fallen below the officiallystated figure of 10 billion dlrs.    "The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in themarket, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily inadvance of an announcement the reserves were down," he said.    The banker said such buying has not been going on. "Thingsare normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development."    Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.    A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade officialsaid this year's outlook for exports, which account for morethan 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthierthan a year ago.    The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. Itwas quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.    The official said China has taken measures to improve itsexport performance, including incentive offers to exporters andthe establishment of export production bases.    "We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year," headded.    Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from thedrop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.    A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs carefulmanagement but its debt service ratio remains very low at sixto eight pct.    "We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchangereserves but on its export performance, just as you assess acompany on its performance, not its bank account," he said.    He said China performed very well in the export field lastyear and remains a very creditworthy country which will havefew difficulties in increasing its borrowing. REUTER&#3;

Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstreamoperations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices anddownstream operations also affected in the first half by largelosses on inventories.    But margins improved in the second half and in particularrefining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a goodrecovery.    The company was commenting on results that showed a netloss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in1985.    The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stgprovision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialledby Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquidnatural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownershipof Gulf Canada's marketing assets.    Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of afurther reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by awithdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling itsU.S. Flag shipping operation.    The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertainalthough it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increasein the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimisticprices would strengthen over the longer term.    Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas putit in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.    In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improveprofitability by selling or restructuring weak operations whilestrengthening core businesses and developing a soundoperational and financial base.    Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalledabout 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.    Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from181p at last night's close.

reut2-003.sgm, INDONESIAN BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES, A tight money market has pushedinterest rates on three to six month time deposits to between15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said.    March is usually a tight month for the money market becauseof tax payments and banks' need to attract funds for theiryear-end accounts on March 31.    This year the situation has been made worse by December'srush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who fearedimposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yetto be converted back into rupiah.    "A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money isholding out until after April," one U.S. Banker said.    The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank,is helping to keep rates high.    Short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with noprospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said.    Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this weekthat Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospectsin 1987/88, but added the "speculators" who led a run on therupiah late last year could again pose problems.    Indonesia holds general elections on April 23, the first infive years, and most businessmen expect no new governmenteconomic packages or incentives before then.    "Some people are nervous about what the government will doafter the election," one banker said. "They normally try to dothings before the IGGI (Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia)meeting (in June) to prove they are doing something about theeconomy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars."

reut2-003.sgm, NAKASONE SET TO STAY UNTIL TAX REFORM APPROVED, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone willstep down only after his plan to overhaul Japan's tax systemgets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides saidtoday.    The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a privatemeeting, "Nakasone's power in office does not necessarilyterminate at the end of his term in October. It depends on when(the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval."    Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despiteSunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservativestronghold.    The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties,had campaigned against a controversial five pct value addedsales tax, the main plank of the reform plans.    The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of thesales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demandingnothing but retraction of the tax.    They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the taxplans. They have been resorting to an on-off boycott ofparliament since February 4.   "If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regularparliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venicesummit of industrial democracies in June and open anextraordinary session to discuss the tax plans," the aide said.    Under law, a regular session can be extended only oncewhile an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The otheroption would be to extend the current session, he said.    "The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidencemotion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another."    One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening upthe way for tax reform.   "Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabineten masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower Housefor a snap general election," the aide said.    That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resignfrom the 512-seat Lower House, necessitating by-elections.    The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after itslandslide victory in general elections last July.    There are five independents and three vacancies.    "The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflatetheir seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism," theaide said.    He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have littleeffect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26.    About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of thenation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections.    "Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will alloppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.    "Possible effects, if any, will be on gubernatorialelections in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido andFukuoka in southern Japan," he said.    The two posts are now held by opposition socialists.

Preussag hasfrequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986following a difficult year in 1985.    Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said inDecember the board would prefer to stick to its policy of notdipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted thefinal dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.    The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 comparedwith 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil andshipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends inthe group's other divisions.    The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domesticgroup would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would dependpartly on the level of provisions.    Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from ninemarks on 1984 results after parent company net profit droppedto 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.    The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marksin 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.    The statement said its results in 1986 were affected byunsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as bypoor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.    The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarterof 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was anadditional factor behind the drop in results.    Preussag said rationalization measures already introducedwould not begin to take full effect until this year.    Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billionmarks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the firsttime consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from itsmajority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.    Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alonewas 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparisonfigures.    Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production roseto 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.    Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)subsidiary, whose results are included in the world groupaccounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter oflast year.    AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by theinternational tin crisis, were the reason behind the worldgroup losses that year. REUTER&#3;

reut2-003.sgm, KOREA PLANS TO OPEN MARKETS TO EASE WON PRESSURE, South Korea will further open its marketto help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight offpressure to revalue the won against the dollar, a governmentspokesman said.    The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae'sstand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrialnations to revalue the won underlined the government'sdetermination to stand firm.    Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce "Demands that Koreacarry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or10 pct are, I believe, extremely ill-advised."    Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of localbusinessmen "The government's policy on the question ofrevaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position."    Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise thewon's value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.    Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month thatnewly industrialising countries, such as South Korea andTaiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate.    But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity hasalready reached "a crisis level."    An official of the Korea Traders' Association (KTA) said ifthe won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the lossof profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters.    "We are determined not to go the way of Latin Americandebtor nations which have suspended interest payments of theirdebts," the spokesman said. "The only way to keep our good recordis to maintain our exports.+    The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue thewon suddenly Korea would run "a tremendous trade deficit andcould degenerate into a country, like many other developingcountries, which is reneging on its international obligations."    The spokesman said South Korea had been graduallyappreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. Sofar this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against thedollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986.    He said South Korea was selecting "many" of 122 items onwhich Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to helpnarrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details weregiven.    Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158items, including sensitive agricultural products and largecars, effective from July.    South Korea posted its first ever current account surpluslast year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlierforecast that its current account surplus could reach eightbillion dlrs this year.    But the government official said the surplus would be heldat around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure byindustrialised nations to push up the value of its currency. REUTER&#3;

But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.    A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers,payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments ofmark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with theBundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System(EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banksbuilt up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.    The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billionmarks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time asan earlier securities repurchase pact matured.    Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as sixbillion marks.    The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman saidyesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to rollover, the possibility that other central banks may choose toredeem them meant a net infusion was needed.    Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.    Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over thefirst nine days of March.

reut2-003.sgm, SPAIN EXTENDS RESERVE REQUIREMENT, The Bank of Spain has extended thereserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta fundsin an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital whichis currently fuelling money supply growth.    In a statement issued late last night, the central banksaid convertible peseta accounts, funds which are not subjectto exchange controls, would also be subject to a 19 pct reserverequirement with effect from Friday.    Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt fromreserve requirements.    The measure comes one week after the central bank raisedreserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentagepoint to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday.    Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offernow -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted alarge influx of speculative foreign capital which isthreatening the government's monetary targets.    They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain'sprincipal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquidassets in public hands (ALP), to have grown by an estimated 17pct annualised rate in February, compared with January's 8.3pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. Thetarget for 1987 is eight pct.    The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds tobanks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the moneymarket. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightlyTreasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday's hike in reserverequirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas fromthe system.    The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interestrates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday's 13.46 pctaverage for deposits.    Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandableresponse "given that the market is short of funds."

"The government should instead seek ways of making the bestuse of its fiscal policy," he told a press conference.    His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economicstimulative package the government plans to adopt in the comingdays.    At the recent talks among the six major industrialisednations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensiveeconomic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn wouldhelp increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.    Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn inthe second half of the year if the yen remains stable.

reut2-003.sgm, U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN, The U.S. is urging reluctantcommercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novelPhilippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believesthe innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debtstrategy, a Reagan administration official said.    The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleasfor interest rate concessions should be treated much moreseriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developingnations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.    In addition, he signaled that the banks might want toreconsider the idea of a "megabank," where Third World debt wouldbe pooled, and suggested the administration would support sucha plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At thesame time, however, the official expressed reservations thatsuch a scheme would ever get off the ground.    The Philippine proposal, together with Argentinesuggestions that "exit bonds" be issued to end the troublesomerole of small banks in the debt strategy, would help tounderpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan,the official said in an interview with Reuters.    "All of these things would fit within the definition of ourinitiative as we have asked it and we think any novel andunique approach such as those should be considered," said theofficial, who asked not to be named.    In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategyunder which commercial banks and multilateral institutions suchas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.    In return, America called on the debtor countries to enacteconomic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.    "The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtorshave been performing well," said the official. But he admittedthat the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly anexception.    The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S.Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker,also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improvetheir role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.    "We called at the very beginning for the bank syndicationsto find procedures or processes whereby they could operate moreeffectively," the official said.    Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions thatcommercial banks create a "megabank" which could swap Third Worlddebt paper for so-called "exit bonds" for banks like regionalAmerican or European institutions.    Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need tolend money to their former debtors every time a new moneypackage was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina inits current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.    He emphasised that the "megabank" was not an administrationplan but "something some people have suggested."    Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks areexamining the creation of a consortium bank to assume ThirdWorld debt. This plan, actively under consideration, woulddiffer slightly from the one the official described.    But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a planwould work in the United States.    "If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,fine. I don't think they ever will."    He pointed out that banks would swap their Third Worldloans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctantto provide new money to debtors through the new institution.    Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan underwhich it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at nomore than 5/8 pct above Libor.    "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quiteunique and I don't think it's something that should becategorically rejected out of hand," the official said.    Banks which found this level unacceptably low would beoffered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a marginabove that of one pct in the form of Philippine InvestmentNotes.    These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have asix-year life and if banks swapped them for cash beforematurity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 pointover Libor.    Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far toolow. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed atstretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt andgranting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduleddebt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political supportin Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early lastyear, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.    But the official denied the plan amounts to interest ratecapitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to thebanks. "It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if youhave a write down in the spread over Libor from what existedbefore," the official said in comments suggesting some ought tobe granted the rate concessions they seek. "Some people arguethat (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it reallyis is narrowing the spread on new money," he added.    He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as aninitiative to include plans like the Philippines'. Reuter&#3;
reut2-003.sgm, POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION, Interest in the currency futures markethas shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentiallyexplosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continentaland Japanese currencies, analysts said.    The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the pastweek-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to thedollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom.    "Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...andtechnically, the pound is in the best shape," PaineWebberanalyst Jason Gillard said.    "We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, andwe're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,"Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said.    Many traders took on long pound/short West German markfutures positions, although some of those cross-trades wereliquidated yesterday, Sloane said.     The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have beenrelatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimismsurrounding the British economy, analysts said.    "Money seems to be chasing yields," William Byers, of BearStearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate.    Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in thepound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek torelieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing downinterest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17.    The budget itself could have an impact, depending on howwell it is received, but analysts say relative interest ratesand oil income remain the main influences on the currency.    However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K.interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cuttheir discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloanesaid.    The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, butSloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon.    The sideways price pattern in the June contract, withsmaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a "bull flag" onprice charts, technically-oriented analysts said.    "It makes for an explosive type of situation that oftenleads to a breakout," in this case to the upside, Sloane said.    Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadiandollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recentclose at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar.    "At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-termpositive, but for the technical burden of proof you need aclose above (the previous contract high of) 75.25," Byers said.    As to the traditionally more active currencies, stabilitywas the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts.    Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs andJune German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400,respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430.    Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still veryrespectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bankintervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada.    "We may still probe to see what the parameters are," Byerssaid, "but people are very reluctant because they don't knowwhere the central banks will be (to intervene)."    Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous priceconsolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundlysluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer atthat level. Reuter&#3;

In a speech to the European Parliament, Delors said some ECleaders told him on a recent tour they could not easily allowadditional resources for the bloc when they were themselvespruning their own spending.    Others called for major spending cut in the EC'scontroversial farm policy in order to free money for regionaland social development.    The Parliament later registered its support for the Delorsplan by voting to approve his continuation in office for asecond two-year term.    Delors has proposed that payments by member states to theEC should be based on their gross national product instead ofon the amount of value added tax they receive. He said thiswould increase EC resources and provide a fairer system ofsharing the financial burden.    He told the Parliament that in reply to complaints aboutincreased payments, he had told some heads of government theCommunity needs more money.    Delors said he agreed with leaders who argued the need toreform the EC farm policy, which currently accounts for overtwo thirds of the 41 billion dlr annual budget."We have to askfor sacrifices but we have to create a future for thosefarmers."    He added, "I was forced to say to some heads of government -Do you want to destroy this common market in agriculture whenyou are asking for a common market in goods and services?"    EC leaders have set 1992 as a target for creating a genuineinternal market in industrial products and services.

reut2-003.sgm, VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS, Lower production of coconutand palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocksthis year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseedsanalyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.    Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at AlbertaAgriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the worldvegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.    "Prices for edible oils appear to have more upsidepotential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedenteddecline in the production of tree oils," Balletto said.    Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palmkernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mlntonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.    He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearanceat 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.    Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.    "If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting thecrush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing inthe edible oils sector could develop," he said.    "This would be relatively favorable for the prices of highoil yielding seeds," Balletto said.    Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed pricesbecause of burdensome supplies, he said.    World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increasefor the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,compared with 25.4 mln last year.    The increase should result from lower disappearance, asproduction is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7mln last year, he said.    World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mlntonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said,while production of other oilseeds was lower.    Higher soybean production in South America and Europe madeup for lower production in the United States, he said.    Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S.stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.    The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.    Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased13.1 mln tonnes.    "During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire worldsurplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificiallyhigh prices caused by the U.S. loan program."    "Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseedsprices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as longas the U.S. soybean surplus continues.    For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in arange tied to the U.S. loan program.    "Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supplyoverhang while strong underlying support is provided by theU.S. loan rate."    The problem is likely to become worse as the artificiallyhigh prices encourage producers in South America, Canada andAustralia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said. Reuter&#3;

Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head ofBrazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads MorganGuaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.    High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil'saccompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term tradeand interbank lines, the bankers said.    Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreedlast March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, aspart of a 31 billion dlr financing package.    Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupledwith Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legalquestions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.    They said they face problems because of the freezerequirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bankunder the trade facility must be deposited instead with thecentral bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switchtheir credit lines from one borrower to another.    The requirement to deposit with the central bank has alsomeant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lowerinterest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would ratheraccept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with thecentral bank.    "It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,"one banker said.    Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results ofa 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance ministerDilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support forBrazil's debt stance.

reut2-003.sgm, HONG KONG RAISES EXCHANGE FUND BORROWING LIMIT, The borrowing limit of the Hong KongExchange Fund, set up to regulate the value of the Hong Kongdollar, has been raised to 50 billion H.K. Dlrs from 30 billionby the legislature, an official statement said.    The limit governs total borrowing by the fund from thegovernment's general revenue account and various funds as wellas borrowing by the fund arising from money market operations.    The bulk of the government's fiscal surplus is invested bythe Treasury with the exchange fund against the issue by thefund of interest-bearing debt certificates, Financial SecretaryPiers Jacobs said.    "At the close of the business today, the total amount ofdebt certificates issued by the Exchange Fund in return formoney transferred from the general revenue account and thevarious funds, in other words the total borrowing by theExchange Fund from these sources, will be 26.9 billion dlrs,"Jacobs said.    He said borrowing arising from money market operationswould amount to an additional 2.9 billion dlrs, making a totalof 29.8 billion dlrs, just short of the borrowing limit of 30billion dlrs.    Jacobs said the government's fiscal reserves are expectedto total 32 billion dlrs by the end of the current fiscal yearending March 31.    "The current borrowing limit of 30 billion dlrs will,therefore, constrain the ability of the Exchange Fund tocontinue to take in these fiscal reserves by the issue ofinterest-bearing debt certificates," he said.    "It will also constrain the ability of the exchange fund inits money market operations," he added. REUTER&#3;
reut2-003.sgm, OFFICIAL SAYS REAGAN OPPOSES SECURITIES TAX, The Reagan administration is totallyopposed to recent Democratic suggestions that securitiestransactions should be taxed to help curb the budget deficit,an administration official said in an interview.    "We're totally opposed to a securities transfers tax. Itwould impair the efficiency of some of the most efficientmarkets in the world," he said. He declined to be named.    In recent days House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat,has called for such a tax to raise the 20 billion dlrs heestimates is needed to meet legal deficit reduction targets.    "It would fall primarily in my view not on wealthyindividuals but on middle income people who occasionally investand trade. So I think it's a very bad idea," said the official,who is an administration economic policy-maker.    The official also rejected a suggestion by Wright that theadministration delay next year's cut in top tax rates, calledfor in the recently-passed overhaul of the U.S. Tax system.    "It is breaking faith with the American people ... It wouldbe a real breach of faith," he said.    The Gramm-Rudman Hollings law calls for a balanced budgetby 1991, but its power has been reduced in the Supreme Court.    Wright and other Democrats say even if they pass PresidentReagan's budget proposals for the fiscal year starting thisOctober, they would miss by some 20 billion dlrs the 108billion dlr target for the budget deficit set under theGramm-Rudman law.    The administration puts the deficit at 173.2 billion dlrsin the current fiscal year and claims that spending cuts andrevenue increases will achieve the Gramm-Rudman goal.    The official, who is knowlegeable on budget strategy, alsosaid President Reagan was still opposed to a so-called 'budgetsummit' with Congress to resolve the deficit issue.    The suggestion of a 'budget summit' emerged again recentlyafter Democrats and Republicans alike said Reagan needed adeficit reduction package and an arms control accord withMoscow to rebuild his presidency after the Iran arms scandal.    But the official dismissed the budget summit idea as anattempt by the Democrats to secure a tax increase. He accusedthem of being overly critical before they had written their ownbudget proposal, due out on April 1.    "It's easier to write a book review than it is to write abook. We've written a book and the Democrats are writing a bookreview every day. Let's see their book," he said. REUTER&#3;

An IMF delegation, which visited Israel this week, issuedan interim report praising Israel's success in slashinginflation from 440 pct in 1985 to 19.7 pct last year withouttriggering mass unemployment.    But it held up Argentina and Brazil as examples of theperils awaiting countries who did not follow up onstabilization programs.    "Continued rapid rise in wages would threaten the progressin reducing inflation and the present level of employment," theIMF said.    The report echoed warnings last week by Bank of IsraelGovernor Michael Bruno and the private Bank Hapoalim thathigher wages, government overspending and a consumer boom wererekindling inflation. "Though wage developments and thereacceleration of inflation are worrisome, there is still timeto put the stabilization program back on track," it said.    The warning comes ahead of Israel's key public sector wagenegotiations next month.    Bank Hapoalim chief economist Petahia Bar-Shavit said realgrowth of wages in 1986 was about 10 pct, following a fall ofbetween 15 and 20 pct in the second half of 1985 when thegovernment's economic stabilisation programme was introduced.    Hapoalim forecast last week that inflation would rise toaround 30 pct this year and a second devaluation might benecessary later in the year, following the 9.75 pct devaluationagainst the dollar in January.    Bar-Shavit also said the government was implementing apolicy of cutting taxes without a clear strategy for balancingthe budget.    The IMF report said monetary policy was relaxed too fastlast year and it supported the Bank of Israel's raising ofinterest rates in the last month. REUTER&#3;

After a day of meetings with Vice President George Bush,Secretary of State George Shultz and Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige, Clark told a press conference he was persuaded theReagan adminstration had begun to deal seriously with Canadaand its concerns.    But he admitted he had won no assurances Washington wouldgo along with his government's position on several keycontroversial issues.    "There's a lot more attention to Canadian files. Whatremains to be seen is how much progress will be achieved," hetold reporters.    The meetings, which end today with talks on Capitol Hill,are part of a routine U.S.-Canadian consultation but are alsoexpected to lay groundwork for a summit in Ottawa next monthbetween President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.    Clark discouraged speculation that lack of a firm Americancommittment on the thorny issue of acid rain could render thesummit a failure.

reut2-003.sgm, U.S. BANKS, THRIFTS FACE CHANGE FROM SENATE BILL, U.S. banks and savings and loaninstitutions could face important changes as a result ofemergency legislation adopted overwhelmingly by the SenateBanking Committee.    The bill approved 12-6 yesterday would rescue theunderfunded federal deposit insurance fund for thrifts andtemporarily halt new developments in the provision of financialservices.    The bill, which goes to the full Senate, will infuse abadly needed 7.5 billion dlrs into the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., which insures accounts of depositors.    It also limits banks' ability to sell securities andrestricts a new breed of competitor, the so-called nonbankbanks.    Committee Chairman William Proxmire, the bill's sponsor,promised the committee will work on a long-term plan for newdevelopments in the financial services industry, which isconfronted by growing competition from firms in othercommercial centers, such as London and Tokyo.    "This bill we are taking up today is the first step in thiseffort," the Wisconsin Democrat said.    But Sen. Jake Garn, the committee's top Republican,chastised senators for imposing temporary restrictions onfinancial providers.    "It is time to forget the special interests," the Utahsenator said.    Garn failed to win approval for an amendment that wouldhave eliminated virtually all of the bill's provisions exceptthe rescue for FSLIC.    A major controversy focused on nonbank banks, which offerlimited financial services of a bank and avoid most bankingregulations.    Proxmire succeeded in closing a loophole which would permitnew nonbank banks and thrifts until Congress passescomprehensive bank reform, a move welcomed by the bankindustry.    But at the same time, the bill set a moratorium on a numberof new activities that banks may undertake, including sellinginsurance, securities and real estate for one year after thebill becomes law.    The 7.5 billion dlr rescue for FSLIC represented acompromise between a larger amount sought by the Reaganadministration and a smaller figure proposed by the thriftindustry.    The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, an industry group,feared approval of a larger amount for FSLIC would lead to asurge of closings of thrifts by federal superviors.    "We hope the Congress will finally settle on a lower number,"William O'Connell, president of the league, said after thecommittee voted. Reuter&#3;
reut2-003.sgm, TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN, The oil services industry is on theverge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oilindustry analysts said.    The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on somestocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in thesecond half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in thefirst half, and continue into the next decade.     "People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to goup to start buying," said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior researchanalyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.    Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>,Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, BakerInternational &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>,which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, aDallas-based investor.    Analysts said although major oil companies are increasingexploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup inoil services will begin in the U.S.    "Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move upfaster," said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.    The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co&lt;HT> figures show.    The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 isprojected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. "Thefirst significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in thesecond half of 1988," Kerridge said.    Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similarpattern, Kerridge said.    "Halliburton is the best value," said Jeffrey Freedman,vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, addingthe company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of commonstock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cashflow including debt.    Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil servicestock.    "Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominanttechnical leader in the industry," Freedman said.    "Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring,including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and itsconsiderable cash horde sets the stage for the company tomaximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize onthe project upturn in exploration and development activity,"according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president atRobert W. Baird and Co Inc.    Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 ctsin 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87billion dlrs.    Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oilservice companies and said choosing among them is difficult.Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in apossible merger with Hughes Tool Co.    Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery butpossibly not as much as other companies because it is not apure service company, Sweeney said.    Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to costreductions and streamlined operations, including the sale andleaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup. Reuter&#3;

The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previousyear and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's sharecapital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986from 2.7 billion a year earlier.    Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference whenthe bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profitof 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.    Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.    The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total roseto 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.    General director Hannes Androsch said higher investmentwould lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Lastyear's better profits had resulted from improvements inservices provided by the bank and also in profits on schillinglending.    Schilling lending had grown last year and interest ratemargins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory whencompared with those in other countries, he said.    Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home andabroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.    Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business hadfallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheettotal.    In an attempt to generate more foreign business,representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, HongKong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans toabolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares anddrawing dividends.    Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt roseeight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokerssaid improved results had been widely expected by investors.

He told a news conference here "After due consultation withmy colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeriaand all member countries of OPEC remain determined to upholdthe December agreement by adhering strictly to their variousquotas and official selling prices."    Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.    "We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleadingnews in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC membercountries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in themonth of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.    Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firmdetermination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrsagreed upon last December in Geneva.    The December agreement set an overall output ceiling forOPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixedprices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.    Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord butfell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing morethan the agreed level.    "The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would nothold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases ofOPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukmansaid.    He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was basedon the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, addingthat Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000bpd.    Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,while the production figures of Ecuador and the United ArabEmirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.    "If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreementsucceed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price levelof 18 dlrs," the group's president said.    He said the OPEC price differentials committee meetingformerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.    "Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference isat the moment contemplated since most agreements reached inDecember are being adhered to," he said.    Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrowthe gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed inrelation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied "We considerthe defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."    Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawnon stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels wellbelow this time last year and soon they would return to themarket in search of crude.    "We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty inmaintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,"Lukman said.    The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which hesaid had contributed to the group's efforts to stabiliseprices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-heldview not to do anything to help the market.    "We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term withtwo-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future isours. We will use that advantage responsibly," he said.    Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's outputfollowing an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if theSouth American country would be allowed a higher output quotawhen it recovered from the disaster.

Senators on a special Senate committee investigating thescandal want to grant limited immunity from prosecution toforce early testimony from Lt. Col. Oliver North and JohnPoindexter.    North is the National Security Council (NSC) aide PresidentReagan fired November 25 for possibly illegal diversion of Iranarms payments to the so-called contra rebels. Poindexter, whowas NSC director and North's boss, resigned the same day.     The Washington Post said over the weekend that Poindexterwas ready to testify that he told Reagan twice of the fundsdiversion, contrary to Reagan's denial that he knew of it.    Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said he asked a specialHouse committee yesterday to delay limited immunity for Northand Poindexter for at least 90 days, and would make the samerequest to the Senate committee today.    Walsh said he was also urging the committees to delaygranting immunity for a third key figure, retired Air ForceMaj. Gen. Richard Secord, a close North associate.

reut2-003.sgm, HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT, National Bank of Hungary firstvice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pctdevaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress lastyear's severe trade deficit with the West.    Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve atleast equilibrium on its hard currency trade.    "It is useful to have a devaluation," he said. "There is now areal push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports."    The official news agency MTI said today Hungary woulddevalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to beannounced later today. Fekete said the rates would come intoeffect tomorrow.    He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary hada higher rate of inflation over the past two years than itsmain partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and5.5 pct in 1986).    This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took toprevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks ofthe 1970s, he added.    Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and bybetween three and four pct early last year.    But the country's hard currency trade balance neverthelessfell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.    Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency tradesurplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that amore likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on totalhard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.    One Western commercial attache here said: "Devaluation ofitself will not change anything. It will only be useful if theyalso make efforts to restructure industry and improve thequality of their export goods."    Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms thisyear to invest in restructuring industry.    It would be his role to persuade international banks tocooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given anAA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samuraibond market.    Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billiondlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of acurrent account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly becausethe fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debtdenominated in marks or yen.    He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly thisyear, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose ofmodernisation.    "I am for credits to invest for that purpose," he said. "I amagainst credits for consumption." He forecast gross domesticproduct growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.   Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debtprofile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium termloans with cheaper long term money for which it was lookingmore and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where heconsidered rates to be low.    Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay ataround 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, whichtripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year afterquadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry wasworking out measures to reduce an approved target deficit forthis year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billionforints.

Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for anexpected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles ofpipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port ofBalao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.    Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lendEcuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.    The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports thatVenezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota,set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.    "All options are open at this moment in the context ofcooperation on oil production," a Venezuelan energy and minesministry source said.    Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula tocompensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while thepipeline is repaired, officials said.    Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and minesminister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks attechnical level, officials said.    Industry sources said that among the options are forVenezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuelaand non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supplyEcuador's Far Eastern clients.    But the ministry source said that no decision has yet beenreached on the matter, and that an announcement would be madein due course.    Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would haveto import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet itsneeds until the line was repaired.

reut2-003.sgm, CHRYSLER &lt;C> DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS, Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid totakeover American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> should help bolster thesmall automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000employees in doubt, industry analysts say.    It was "business as usual" yesterday at the American Motorsheadquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled byChrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to companyspokesman Edd Snyder.    But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than ifit had continued with the state-run French car group as itscontrolling shareholder.    Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assemblyplant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant wouldbe in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North Americanauto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.    Both plants are far from "state of the art" for carmanufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor laborrelations at each.    "Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants," said MichaelLuckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm ShearsonLehman Brothers. "They probably will close the Toledo plant andmove Jeep production to Canada."    Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at thevery least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able towring concessions from the United Automobile Workers unionlocal representing Jeep workers.    "The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as theyhave AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will haveunderutilized facilities to transfer production," he said.    Analysts said they foresaw no major complications thatwould abort a combination which historians said would be theauto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formedin 1954.    AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its lossesof more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in Francefor Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it couldnot forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at theearliest.    In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman LeeIacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mlndlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of1,200 dealers as the major attractions.    Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventuallyto sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overheadcosts in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incurin the AMC buyout.

reut2-003.sgm, NAKASONE SET TO STAY UNTIL TAX REFORM APPROVED, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone willstep down only after his plan to overhaul Japan's tax systemgets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides saidtoday.    The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a privatemeeting, "Nakasone's power in office does not necessarilyterminate at the end of his term in October. It depends on when(the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval."    Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despiteSunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservativestronghold.    The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties,had campaigned against a controversial five pct value addedsales tax, the main plank of the reform plans.    The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of thesales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demandingnothing but retraction of the tax.    They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the taxplans. They have been resorting to an on-off boycott ofparliament since February 4.   "If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regularparliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venicesummit of industrial democracies in June and open anextraordinary session to discuss the tax plans," the aide said.    Under law, a regular session can be extended only oncewhile an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The otheroption would be to extend the current session, he said.    "The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidencemotion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another."    One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening upthe way for tax reform.   "Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabineten masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower Housefor a snap general election," the aide said.    That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resignfrom the 512-seat Lower House, necessitating by-elections.    The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after itslandslide victory in general elections last July.    There are five independents and three vacancies.    "The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflatetheir seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism," theaide said.    He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have littleeffect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26.    About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of thenation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections.    "Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will alloppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.    "Possible effects, if any, will be on gubernatorialelections in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido andFukuoka in southern Japan," he said.    The two posts are now held by opposition socialists.

The complaint said Vaskevitch leaked informationabout 12 companies that were involved in a merger or aquisitionwhich resulted in more than four mln dlrs in profit for himselfand others involved in the scheme.    Besides Vaskevitch, who is a British and Israeli citizenwho lives in London, others named as defendants in the suitwere David Sofer, an Israeli citizen living in Jerusalem, andtwo corporations, &lt;Plenmeer Ltd>, a British company, and &lt;MedaEstablishment>, a Lichtenstein corporation.

reut2-003.sgm, NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES, U.K. Interest rates look set to movelower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension ofa British National Savings issue yesterday.    The Department of National Savings, effectively a TreasuryDepartment unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launchedin October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-yearprivate investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman saidthe suspension was just a reaction to yields on nationalsavings bonds being way out of line with the rest of themarket.    The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutestoday of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, thesecond such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.    They said the near-instant sale of the entire new giltsissue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pctdownpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rateshad to drop sooner rather than later.    The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downwardpressure on money market rates remained intact, with thebellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at10-9-7/8 pct.     It coincided with another strong sterling rally whichpushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.    "That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed," saidStephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokersPhillips and Drew; "It is an indication that the market believesrates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-pointimmediately after the budget (on March 17), and some peoplehope for more."    Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by theNational Savings Department was "of considerable significance."    It said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are beingquickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by thebuilding societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cutin bank base rates to 10 pct materialises."    Building societies have said a drop in bank base rateswould normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to areduction in mortgage lending rates.    Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed theNational Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasurypolicy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.    "National Savings has been competing too effectively withthe building societies of late. Building society income hasbeen depressed in recent months," he said.    He and other analysts said Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lidon U.K. Inflation.    Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britainthan in most other Western economies with inflation seen risingwell above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 afterlast year's 3.7 pct.    Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumerprices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rateswould reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.    But Lewis and others noted that building societies had beencomplaining to the government about intense competition fromNational Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for earlymortgage rate cuts.    "The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBRfunding from National Savings, but he must be taking thebuilding societies' criticism to heart. It looks like theNational Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said.    A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on thisinterpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely areaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which hadpushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line withthe rest of the market.    "We are not politically motivated ... Funding was justbecoming too expensive and we don't need all that money," hetold Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues atleast twice in the past, when offered interest rates were aboveor below market rates.    He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late asU.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline andincome was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billionstg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.    In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving'scontribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg,compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of theprevious year, official figures show.    Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show afurther increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing thetotal for 11 months above target, government officials said. REUTER&#3;

In remarks prepared for delivery to the Senate AgricultureCommittee, Brian Crowley, senior associate director of GAO,also said that a preliminary analysis of proposed changes inFmHA's financial eligibility standards indicated as many as onehalf of FmHA borrowers who received new loans from the agencyin 1986 would be ineligible under the proposed system.    The agency has proposed evaluating applicants' credit usinga variety of financial ratios instead of relying solely oncashflow ability.    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)slammed the proposed eligibility changes, telling FmHAAdministrator Vance Clark at a hearing that they would mark a"dramatic shift" in the agency's purpose away from being farmers'lender of last resort toward becoming a "big city bank."    But Clark defended the new regulations, saying the agencyhad a responsibility to administer its 70-billion dlr loanportfolio in a "compassionate yet judicious manner."    Crowley of GAO, Congress' investigative arm, said theproposed credit scoring system attempted to ensure that FmHAwould make loans only to borrowers who had a reasonable changeof repaying their debt.

reut2-003.sgm, BELGIAN MINISTER UNVEILS PRIVATISATION PLAN, Belgian Budget Minister GuyVerhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in severalstate-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena andthe postal and telecommunications authority, government sourcessaid.    They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francsin revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt'sprojections, helping the government to reduce its huge budgetdeficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.    But the scheme had received a guarded reception from theSocial Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalitionwhen Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.    Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult,the sources said.    Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the lastquarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of stateinvestment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise threebillion francs, they added.    A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal andtelecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages inmid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.    Also on Verhofstadt's list are the Maritime TransportAuthority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savingsbank, CGER, and several other credit institutions.

Licht said.    It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar priceswould have a marked effect on planting intentions this year,Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect wasprobably minimal.    The total beet area in the European Community is forecastto fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986.    The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha,against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln.    Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares(with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114(118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44),Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138),Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52),Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136).    Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400(3440), Albania 10 (9), Bulgaria 52 (50), Czechoslovakia 195(196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460(440), Romania 295 (280).    On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said thesearea forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mlntonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly highlast season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increasesthe chances of a significant reduction in production in1987/88.    Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production couldfall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mlnin 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9mln tonnes against 18.1 mln.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, said the offersto buy back his stock occurred "on several occasions during thepast year."    The offers were made by several Caesars Worldrepresentatives, including its chairman, Henry Gluck, he said.    Sosnoff said he rejected all of the proposals.

reut2-003.sgm, ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS, Lured by the weakening dollar and theconviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, Europeanenergy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reservesto replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.    They said owning oil reserves in a politically stableUnited States is good insurance against future shortages.However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated upcompetition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choicedomestic oil properties.    Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil andgas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyershad helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. Allbuyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs abarrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 foracquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and fivedlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.    "Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, butwe're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in," saidArthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist andpresident of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.    "Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil andgas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries," he added.    Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believethe trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 becauseof the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception thatoil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper tobuy new reserves than to explore for them.    Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks tothe need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments andgeneral restructuring throughout the oilpatch.    In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of &lt;Total CompagnieFrancaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs toseparately acquire oil assets of Texas International &lt;TEICC>and Lear Petroleum Partners &lt;LPP>. A spokesman for Minatomesaid the company is searching for additional acquisitions.    A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, &lt;Petrofina S.A.>and &lt;Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buyvirtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos &lt;WMB>,the Oklahoma pipeline firm.    But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventureswith experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's&lt;Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's &lt;TX> Texaco USA in a100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined withDupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.    Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, itsgeographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil aremore important factors in evaluating potential acquisitionsthan relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.    Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representingInternational Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of &lt;PreussagCorp> and &lt;C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm hadearmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves inTexas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.    But he called that a small amount compared to the amountother investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's GeodyneEnergy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend upto 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.    "The competition is stiff, not only from other foreigninvestors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oilcompanies," he said. "Our company is shopping around because wefeel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. Ifyou're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you needprices higher than the current market," he added.    In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokeragehouses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were alsocompeting for prime properties.    Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group&lt;RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying andselling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquiredtwo billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels ofoil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.    "Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of thesecompanies," Smith said. "Domestic production has dropped by onemln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it maydrop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988." Reuter&#3;

Last year, about 18 pct of the utility's revenues came fromNew Mexico, 70 pct from retail electricity sales in Texas and12 pct from wholesale sales under federal regulation.    In January the company filed a formal rate case with NewMexico regulators seeking a 21.66 pct increase in its annualrates there which would have been equal to about 13.9 mln dlrsnet of fuel savings.    El Paso Electric said it reached a stipulated settlement onits New Mexico rates with several parties, including the stateof the New Mexico Public Service Commission, which provides forrate treatment of the utility's investment in the Palo VerdeNuclear Generating Station located near Phoenix, Ariz.    The company said commission hearings on the stipulatedsettlement are expected to start next month. If it is approved,the new rates could go into effect as early as this summer. ElPaso Electric's January rate case will remain before thecommission pending approval of the settlement.    El Paso Electric said the agreement provides got continuedfull inclusion in its rate base of the costs of Palo Verda Unitone, maximum rate increases of three pct on a cents perkilowatt hour basis in 1987, 1988 and 1989, and no further rateincreases until 1994.    Once the agreement is approved, the utility would stillhave to prove cost of service increases to support at least themaximum increase each year, a spokesman explained.    The company said it will attempt to settle the cost ofservice issues in timed to allow the new rates to go intoeffect this summer.    El Paso Electric said the agreement allows recovery in itsNew Mexico rates of lease payments in connection with theutility's 1986 sale and leaseback of its investment in PaloVerde Unit Two to the extent of the book value sold.    The company said it agreed that none of its costs for PaloVerde Unit Three will be included in its New Mexico rates.    The utility said the agreement also resolves any issuerelating to the prudence of the planning, management andconstruction of Palo Verde and settles any possible issue ofexcess generating capacity through 1993.    El Paso Electric said it does not expect to have excessgenerating capacity.    The agreement also provides that any portion of the cost ofservice deferrals not recouped prior to December 31, 1994 willnot be recovered through New Mexico rates, the company said,adding it expects to recoup all deferrals in full by that date.

reut2-003.sgm, CBT POSTPONES NIGHT TRADING START TO APRIL 30, The Chicago Board of Trade's (CBT)board of directors voted to postpone the start of what will bethe first U.S. evening futures trading session until April 30from April 2 to give participants a chance to get ready, theexchange announced.    Several trading firms had asked for a delay in the start-upof the evening session so that the firms can work outoperational difficulties created by the off-hours session.    CBT chairman Karsten Mahlmann said in a statement the delaywill "afford all firms the time necessary to be 100 pct readyfor this innovative program, we are postponing the openingdate."    The board of directors accepted yesterday's recommendationby a committee of members overseeing the planned eveningsession, which was originally scheduled to start April 2. Thesession is designed to begin the global trading day from 1800to 2100 local Chicago time Monday through Thursday.    CBT members overwhelmingly approved the evening session ina vote conducted a month ago.    But before night trading can begin, the CBT still has toobtain approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.    Pending regulatory approval, the CBT plans to offer eveningtrading in the world's most active futures contract, Treasurybonds, along with Treasury note futures and options on thosecontracts.    The evening session will make available to traders in theFar East interest rate hedging vehicles when their day is justbeginning, and the CBT hopes to attract trading capital fromthe Pacific Rim's burgeoning financial centers.    When the idea for a night trading session was broached, itmet with resistance from many local traders who said thesession would add to the physical strain of their jobs.    Many traders and member firms also questioned whether thenight session would have the liquidity necessary to survive,and complained that the cost of manning trading desks for twosessions per 24-hour cycle might not be worthwhile.    Some credit market analysts, including Norman Quinn,president of Golden Gate Futures, said the night session wouldlikely be dominated by institutions, because the larger localtraders would refuse to return at night.    Nevertheless, Quinn and other traders said the nightsession has a good chance of succeeding. Reuter&#3;

Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that hethought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration,"should be seriously considered" because a refusal to do so could"play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls" placedon production.    However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of theirincome support payments regardless of how much they planted.    The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed twoproblems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. Inaddition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farmbill, Dole said.    Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board exportenhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Unioncould help improve U.S. relations with that country.    Dole said that the United States has made the decision totrade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitiveprices.    The senator predicted Congress would have to decide thisyear whether to require an expansion of the export subsidyprogram, which currently targets benefits to recapture marketslost to other suppliers which subsidize.

reut2-003.sgm, CHRYSLER &lt;C> SELLS BONDS FROM ITS PORTFOLIO, Chrysler Corp today sold 405 mln dlrsof corporate bonds from its nearly 3.5 billion dlr pension fundto Wall Street investment bankers, vice president and treasurerFred Zuckerman said.    He said this was the first of two planned sales ofcorporate issues from the fund's portfolio. Zuckerman saidChrysler will sell slightly less than one billion dlrs ofcorporates.    "Phase two (the second sale) will be in a month or so," theChrysler executive said, adding that proceeds will be investedexclusively in the equities market.    Before today's sale of corporate bonds, those securitieshad comprised roughly two thirds of the pension fund portfolio.    "After the two sales, equities will amount to 50 pct ormore of the portfolio," Zuckerman said.    "We believe that the equity market has much more upsidepotential than the bond market," the executive said. "Interestrates are not coming down and I would not bet a lot that theywill drop sharply."    He added, "I personally think interest rates may decline by50 basis points at the most this year."    Zuckerman said the 405 mln dlr bond sale was composed of139 separate issues.    "Sixty pct were utilities, 20 pct were issued by foreigngovernments or corporations, and 20 pct were financialinstitutions," he detailed.    The Chrysler treasurer said that the corporate paper hadtypically an 18-year maturity. "The securities were long-term,high-quality bonds, mostly rated AA-minus or A-plus," he said.    Zuckerman said Chrysler sold the corporate bonds at about1.6 pct above yesterday's closing prices for these issues."That showed our portfolio is desirable," he commented.    Corporate bond traders noted that Chrysler's sale occurredagainst the backdrop of a slightly weak secondary market.    They said they believed that Chrysler was sold thecorporates at a large profit because the issues were bought bythe automaker for its portfolio when interest rates were muchhigher.    Chrysler's Zuckerman said his company sold the corporateissues to four large Wall Street securities firms.    He said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon BrothersInc bought most of the bonds. However, Zuckerman declined toname the other two houses.    Yesterday, Chrysler presented four investment bankers witha list of bonds and asked them to submit bids by this morning.    Zuckerman said that Morgan Stanley bought more corporatebonds than any one of the other three houses.    Wall Street sources said they believed First Boston Corpand Merrill Lynch Capital Markets were also in on the biddingfor the corporate bonds. They believed these two firms wereawarded bonds by the carmaker as well.    A spokesman for Morgan declined to comment and referredinquiries to Chrysler. Officials at Salomon, First Boston andMerrill Lynch were unavailable for immediate comment. Reuter&#3;

Boone Pickens may betargeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analystssaid.    Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said "we have no comment tomake whatsoever." Pickens was not available for comment.    Traders noted that activity in the stock increased todayafter a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco.    Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4.    Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard,Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised atmarket rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeoverattempt.    "It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and hisgroup may be interested," Feretti said.    "But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of itssheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes achallenge."    Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take overDallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA> last winter, has madeno secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gasreserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize soonerthan oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimatedin excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said.    Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow ofabout 10 dlrs a share "which is probably very attractive toPickens." Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup valuewell into the 60 dlr a share range.    "I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostiletakeover," Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analystJohn Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors.    "Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrsin long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding." He said thebuyer would also have to deal with "the intractable problems"Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energybusinesses.    Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number ofdefensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such asspin off some of its non-energy businesses directly toshareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnershipout of its natural gas pipeline interests.    An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouragedthe Pickens rumor. "Pickens has a plateful already with hisholdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess," he said. "Idon't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problemswith Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losingabout 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billiondlrs on the market today."

reut2-003.sgm, BRAZIL'S SARNEY MEETS STRIKES WITH SHOW OF FORCE, With troops in place in Brazil'sports and oil installations, the government of Prersident JoseSarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show offorce.    Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supportedin some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries andsix areas of oil production.    The state-oil company Petrobras requested the interventionbecause of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industryemployees.    The government had already dispatched more than 1,000marines to occupy the country's main ports after a nationalseamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday.    The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day,represents a stern challenge to the government.    The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazildesperately needs foreign exchange.    It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance whichprecipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision onFebruary 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofcommercial debt.    There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen'sstrike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the mostimportant in South America -- and the country's other mainports.    Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand onthe quays near the strike-bound ships, but the militarypresence here is generally discreet.    A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most areout of sight.    Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, theDocemarte, seamen's leaders said. After explaining to thecaptain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail becausethe strike was illegal, the men returned to work.    One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said "it is apsychological war. They are using force and we are usingpeaceful methods."    Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, theDocemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working.    At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio deJaneiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships arestrike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports.    Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters inRio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on boardships here were not running out of food.    The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney'scivilian government since it came to power two years ago.    Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands offarmers held rallies directed largely against high bankinterest rates.    The current rash of labour unrest in industry andagriculture stems from the failure of the government'snow-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze. Reuter&#3;

The major test of House sentiment came several hours beforethe chamber was to take a final vote on the assistance.    However, the 227 to 198 vote on a procedural matter wasseen as a temporary defeat for Reagan, who has made aid to the"contra" rebels one of his major foreign policy initiatives.   Congressional leaders, including foes of contra aid, haveacknowledged that despite today's rebuff, which was expected,it will be virtually impossible to prevent the 40 mln dlrs,which was approved last year, from going through.    Even if the Senate goes along with the House in postponingthe aid, Reagan will veto the legislation and Congress is notexpected to be able to override the veto.

reut2-003.sgm, ADMINISTRATION SAID LAX ON ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT, A group of state officials and a keyU.S. senator said a corporate merger wave was harming theeconomy and blamed the Reagan administration for laxness inenforcing the federal antitrust laws.    Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who chairs theSenate Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee, alsocautioned the Department of Justice (DOJ) to comply with hisrequest for a listing of each case since 1980 in whichdepartment officials had rejected a staff recommendation toprosecute a suspected antitrust violation.    Metzenbaum had asked for the data by Monday, but the DOJfailed to meet the deadline and later hinted it might refuse tocomply.    Acting Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust CharlesRule defended the administration's record on antitrustenforcement and told the panel at today's hearing that thedepartment was in the process of preparing a response toMetzenbaum's request.    "We have nothing to hide, but we have to be concerned aboutour institutional interests," Rule said. He provided noexplanation of what those interests were.    Metzenbaum said he had scheduled the hearings and requestedthe data out of concern "that this administration has abandonedthe nation's historical commitment to effective antitrustenforcement."    "The green light is on," he said. "Merger mania is rampantin this country...and it is not serving us well."    Rule countered that the low inflation and interest ratesand the continuing economic expansion meant theadministration's policies were working well.    He said simply looking at the number of challenges filedagainst pending mergers was misleading because there was noreason to believe that a fixed proportion of all mergers wereanticompetitive.    "If you look at the individual cases rather than thestatistics, you will see that we are appropriately enforcingthe antitrust laws," Rule said.    Metzenbaum's view, however, was bolstered by the NationalAssociation of Attorneys General, a group of top state lawenforcement officials.    "The federal assault on antitrust has been comprehensive,"Robert Abrams, attorney general of New York and chairman of thegroup's antitrust committee, told the panel.    "The reduction in enforcement has been exacerbated byfederal attempts to prevent both state attorneys general andprivate parties from enforcing the law in accordance with itsclear meaning and Supreme Court interpretations," Abrams said.    The group has drafted its own merger guidelines to bringuniformity to the attorney generals' efforts to enforce thelaws at the state level. Reuter&#3;

An officer on Daiwa's corporate syndicate desk said hebelieved this was Rockwell's first debt offering since 1984,when the company tapped the Euromarkets.    Daiwa, the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd of Japan,has become the first foreign bookrunner in the U.S. corporatedebt market this year. The firm is sustaining a trend thatfirst emerged in early 1986, investment bankers said.    Daiwa headed a syndicate that won the Rockwell notes incompetitive bidding. Rockwell has a net interest charge of7.722 pct for the issue, the Daiwa officer said.    The Japanese firm bid the notes at 98.473 and set a couponof 7-1/2 pct and reoffering price of 98.75 to yield 46 basispoints more than comparable Treasury securities.    Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the46 basis point spread over Treasuries was aggressive. They saida premium of 50 basis points or more would have been moreappropriate. "It looks like Daiwa submitted a kamikaze bid justto get the business," said one competitor.    However, the Daiwa officer defended his firm's pricing ofthe deal.    "Because Rockwell has not floated debt since 1984, thecompany's note issue is a museum piece," he said.    The officer said he believed the Rockwell paper would sellquickly, mostly because the company is well known and has nottapped the debt market in three years.    "Investors are hungry for high-grade debt issued byhousehold names," agreed one corporate bond trader.    Non-callable for seven years, the issue is rated Aa-2 byMoody's and AA by Standard and Poor's.    Daiwa became the second foreign firm to manage an offeringin the domestic debt market in September 1986 when it won incompetitive bidding 125 mln dlrs of 10-year first mortgagebonds of General Telephone Co of California, a unit of GTE Corp&lt;GTE>.

The U.S. unit of Nomura Securities CoLtd of Japan, acting as sole underwriter, won in competitivebidding 250 mln dlrs of extendible notes of General ElectricCredit Corp, a subsidiary of General Electric Co &lt;GE>.    The Rockwell deal is Daiwa's second as lead underwriter.    Last December, Daiwa and Nomura were named primary dealersby the Federal Reserve, along with L.F.

reut2-003.sgm, SOUTH KOREA TO MAINTAIN TRADE SURPLUS 3-5 YEARS, South Korean Trade Minister RhaWoong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus forthree to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt.    He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few yearsit was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goodsand move toward a more balanced trade position.    He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nationwas to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.    Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had atrade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900mln dlrs.    Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once itsforeign debt was substantially reduced, he said "yes, I thinkso."    Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade missionhere during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. productsvalued at 1.8 billion dlrs.    About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of thetype South Korea normally bought from Japan.    Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talkswith Canadian officials and businessmen.    He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reducehis country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United Statesand also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan.    Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange ratesbetween the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buyU.S. goods than Japanese goods.    He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and hehoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way toresolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation.    Rha said "I hope the leaders can get together to find asolution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions."    But he added "the leaders seem hesitant to make concessionsbecause of domestic political reasons."    Speaking of his own country, he said "We have made a lot ofconcessions already."    He cited regulations permitting foreign investment inindustrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activityand cracking down on piracy of intellectual property bystrengthening protection of copyrights and patents.    Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs.    Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods ifCongress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at thismoment, we have no thought of retaliation."    South Korea is a major exporter to the United States oftextiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as televisionsets, video cassette records and personal computers.    Its puchases from the United States include electronictesting equipment and grains and cotton.

reut2-003.sgm, ANALYSTS SAY NEW DOW COMPONENTS AID AVERAGE, Wall Street market analysts said twochanges in the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Averagewere part of a shift away from smokestack industries that havelong dominated the 30-stock index.    "It strengthens the Dow," said William LeFevre, analyst atAdvest Inc. He said Coca-Cola Co &lt;KO>, one of the twoadditions, "is a genuine consumer stock as opposed to asmokestack." He applauded the decision to drop Inco Ltd &lt;N>, "asuper stock at one time that hasn't done much lately."    The editors of the Wall Street Journal also decided to addBoeing Co &lt;BA> and dropping Owens-Illinois Inc &lt;OI>.    Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said Inco was a "stodgynumber." But he noted that putting two new stocks in an averageof 30 is a relatively minor change.    "This will distinctly make the index more useful," saidFrank Korth of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "The movement ofthe market to the upside will be enhanced by the shift toCoke."    But he said Shearson's aerospace analyst today removedBoeing from the firm's recommended list, taking it from a buyto a hold. Korth said Boeing's business appeared to be leaningtoo heavily to the military side as opposed to commercial.    Prior to tomorrow's market opening the Wall Street Journalwill publish a new divisor to be used in calculating the index.LeFevre said the divisor will probably go up a bit but willprobably be lower than its current level of 0.889 later in theyear due to forthcoming splits in components such asInternational Paper Co &lt;IP>.    The divisor, which is adjusted whenver stocks are split,dropped below one for the first time in May of last year. The0.889 divisor means that a change of 1/8 (12.5 cts) in theprice of a component produces a change of about 14 cts in theindex. Reuter&#3;

reut2-003.sgm, HOUSE DEMOCRATS DRAFTING BUDGET AT SNAIL'S PACE, Democrats on the House BudgetCommittee, meeting behind closed doors to draft the outlines ofnext year's federal budget, say their work is proceeding at asnail's pace.    In a series of interviews, panel members conceded that thebudget panel's drafting sessions, which began yesterday andwere initially expected to end late tomorrow, will now extendinto next week.    "We've a long ways to go," Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.). toldReuters.    "We are not making the progress that we should," said Rep.Vic Fazio (D-Calif.).    Members also acknowledged that the panel's preliminary goal for spending cuts and new revenues would not be enough toenable the government to meet the 108 billion dlr deficitceiling set for the coming year by federal law.    Budget Commitee Chairman William Gray (D-Pa.), interviewedduring a break in the lawmakers' secret deliberations, said thecommittee was still debating the shape of the overall budgetand had come to no agreement on the size or precise form of thenew revenues or spending cuts to be pursued.    But the lawmakers said the House Democratic leadership hasasked the panel to come up with a package of 36 billion dlrs indeficit-reducing measures.    The package would include 18 billion dlrs in new revenues,nine billion dlrs in military spending cuts and nine billiondlrs in domestic spending reductions, they said.    The Democratic lawmakers said they were still trying tomeet those goals but had made no firm decisions.    In particular, the legislators said they were havingtrouble coming up with the nine billion dlrs in militaryspending cuts.    "We're talking in the range of 15-20 billion dlrs in newrevenues, but if we can't come up with the full amount ofdefense cuts, we would have to raise more in new revenues,"Fazio said.    The particular manner in which new revenues would be raisedalso has not been decided, the lawmakers said.    House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas) has urged passage of atax on securities transactions to bring an estimated 20 billiondlrs in new revenues into the U.S. Treasury.    But the administration is totally opposed to such a tax, atop official told Reuters yesterday.    The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified,said the administration also opposed another suggestion byWright that the administration delay next year's cut in the toptax rate, called for in the recent tax overhaul law.    The Congressional Democrats first hinted about two weeksago that they would seek to reduce the deficit by about 36billion dlrs and put aside the question of whether the effortwould meet the 108 billion dlr deficit target set for fiscalyear 1988 by the new federal balanced budget law.    The administration has predicted that approval of 42billion dlrs in deficit reductions would meet the target.    Its budget plan, submitted in January, called for 1.024trillion dlrs in spending on revenues of 916 billion dlrs.    But the Congressional Budget Office has said theadministration forecast was based on overly optimisticassumptions about the economy.    The nonpartisan office said the administration's budgetplan, if adopted, would yield a deficit of 134 billion dlrs,missing the deficit target by 26 billion dlrs and. Reuter&#3;
reut2-003.sgm, BIG U.S. CONSERVATION ENROLLMENT EXPECTED, Enrollment in the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's fourth conservation signup is expected to beannounced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may behigher than total enrollment for the first three signups.    Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres,USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far inthe 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.    Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres intothe program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA'sAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at acongressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will beaccepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.    As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area isexpected to attract the greatest enrollment.    "The Great Plains area will be the predominate area whichwe'll get signup in," a USDA conservation specialist said.    Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of theacreage pulled from that area, he said.    Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreagein the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production,but the USDA source said this would be a relatively smallpercent of the total.    A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll partof their corn base acreage into the program has sparked moreinterest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.

Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularlyhigh volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa andSanta Fe provinces.    Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires,heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in LaPampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe.Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.    Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mmin Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm inChaco.    Growers said it was still too early to tell whether therains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflowercrops may have suffered.    Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed bythe bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rainswould have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allowfarm machinery to operate.    The rains caused flooding in western and northwesternBuenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areasthere since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.    Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares,Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said afterflying over the flooded area.    Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said largeparts of the flooded areas were not planted because they arelow-lying and flood easily.    Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by theheavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent ofthe damage. They said it was likely rain combined with highwinds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.    The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and southof Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolatedareas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pcta week ago.    Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop wererevised downward in light of the bad weather.    Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes,down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mlntonnes.    Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a weekago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated aweek ago.    Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes,according to official figures.    Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mlntonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mlntonnes, according to official figures.    Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching betweenfour and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to fourpct a week ago.    Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnesproduced in the last harvest. Reuter&#3;

Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms ofthe proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on howmuch funding the newly combined companies will have to spend onthe disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.    An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish afunding limit.    The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell throughearlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposedJustice Department consent decree that would have given thecompanies only three months to find a buyer for the Reedbusiness.    Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlrlawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with themerger.    Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct ofHughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revisedterms of the agreement give the companies six months to find abuyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previousagreement had proposed a three-month period.    Kistler said the the government had also indicated it wouldconsider granting, if necessary, an additional three-monthextension to complete the sale.    He said there were "several people looking" at the domesticdrilling bit business.    The companies, Kistler said, have also decided tovoluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.    Kistler estimated that the merger, which should becompleted in about two weeks, will result in annual costsavings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantialcutbacks" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,the name the merged company will take.    Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficienciesshould put the company on a profitable course. "We think thatin the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should seesomething close to breakeven," he said.

reut2-003.sgm, PLAN TO CUT DELAYS ADVANCES AT SEVEN AIRPORTS, The Department of Transportation(DOT) said it would go ahead at seven airports with acontroversial plan to reduce airline delays by enablingcompeting companies to coordinate their schedules.    Under the plan, the DOT will grant the airlines immunityfrom the antitrust laws so they can redistribute their flighttimes over the day and avoid the clustering of flights thattypically occurs at the most desirable travel times.    Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said she haddecided to grant unconditional immunity to the carriers servingAtlanta's Hartsfield and Chicago's O'Hare airports.    At five other airports--Dallas-Fort Worth, Boston, Denver,Newark and Philadelphia--Dole said she would grant conditionalimmunity to enable further government study.    Under this part of the plan, the carriers serving thesefive airports have been asked to give DOT their summer 1987schedules by the end of the week.    The agency will then review the schedules and decide byMonday whether they threaten to cause delays.    If so, those airports would be added to the list of thosegranted wider immunity to enable scheduling talks.    Dole said she was confident no anticompetitive effectswould result from the talks, which she said would be monitoredby U.S. officials and would be open to the public.    Flight delays at the nation's 22 busiest airports soared in1986 to 367,000 from 295,000 in 1985. The government believesmost delays are caused by weather.    The DOT first proposed the immunity plan in late Januaryand said it might be granted for a total of 13 airports.    Dropped from the final plan were the Minneapolis-St. Paul,New York-LaGuardia, New York-J.F. Kennedy, San Francisco, St.Louis and Washington-Dulles airports. Reuter&#3;
