reut2-015.sgm, DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED, Roughly half of this year's expected130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in theNetherlands, told Reuters.    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing datefor the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesmanadded.    "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we canexpect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least thecrop is off to a very good start," he said.    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes ofwhite sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has beenintroduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have beenallotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area beingboosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar. Reuter&#3;

He told a press conference after the release of an initialprospectus for the float that the issue would be offered toU.K. Institutions, company employees and the general public.    As in previous flotations, clawback arrangements would bemade if public subscriptions exceeded initial allocations.    He declined to say how the shares would be allocated beyondsaying that a "significant proportion" would go to institutions.    A decision on what percentage would go to each sector wouldbe made shortly before the sale price was announced on April28.    Minimum subscription would be for 400 shares with paymentin two tranches, again a method broadly in line with previousprivatisations.    Chairman Sir Francis Tombs denied suggestions that Rollswas a stock that should be left to the institutions. He notedthat although the aircraft industry was cyclical, Rolls hadseveral operations -- such as spare parts and militaryequipment -- that evened out the swings.    Rolls' 1986 research and development expenditure in 1986was 255 mln stg and could be expected in the future to varyaccording to changes in turnover.    He noted that net research and development expenditure waswritten off in the year it occurred, a policy that received"inadequate recognition in one or two of the more extravagantforecasts of future profits." He made no forecast himself.    In 1986, Rolls reported that pretax profit rose 48 pct to120 mln stg on turnover 12 pct higher at 1.8 billion. Reuter&#3;

Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price forrefined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots inwhich at least 15 people died.    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda laterrevoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail priceincrease, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,a practice discouraged by the IMF.    "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels ofmeal. It (the government) would have to choose between thedemands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry ofAgriculture economist said.

Among interleukin's principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp&lt;CTUS>, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp&lt;IMNX>, based in Seattle, Wash.    The journal, to be released late today, contains twoarticles reporting high remission rates several cancer types.    The journal also contains a signed editorial concludingthat the new results mark a significant milestone in the searchfor a successful immunotherapy for cancer.    Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturallyproduced by living cells in the laboratory.    The drug is controversial because it was widely praised asa promising cancer treatment in early reports on itseffectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a yearlater for its failure to live up to its promise and due to itsravaging side effects.    One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West ofBiotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularlysignificant because it found far fewer harsh side effects afterit changed the way in which the drug is administered.    In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancerpatients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancersand a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skincancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities' StuartWeisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine.    For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found noremissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had sideeffects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospitalcare, according to the article.    In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. StevenRosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchersadministered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pctremission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate inmelanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum.    In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of fourpatients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshnessof the drug's side effects as originally administered.    "Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the searchfor successful immunotherapy for cancer," said the editorial,signed by John Durant of Philadelphia's Chase Cancer Center.    "These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surelydid not describe successful practical approaches ready forwidespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients," theeditorial said.    "On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, asuccessful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then wemay be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction inthe immunuotherapy of cancer," the editorial concluded.

reut2-015.sgm, REPORT SEEKS TO DISALLOW SOUTHERN &lt;SO> COSTS, An audit submitted to the GeorgiaPublic Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear powerstation should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said.    Southern's Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pctinterest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it wouldcost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plant'sowners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the costpassed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs.    The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the reportby O'Brien-Kreitzberg is "flawed and biased." She said thereport was released yesterday by the state attorney general.    Responding to the report today, Georgia Power ChairmanRobert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawnby the firm "are not only wrong -- they also reflect the samebias against nuclear power that these auditors havedemonstrated in similar cases accross the country."    Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was withoutfault, Scherer said "the audit identified several things I wishwe had done differently."    Scherer pointed out a report O'Brien-Kreitzberg submittedto Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Powerwould not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987.    Noting "unit one is finished, and we expect it to be incommercial operationg by June," he said the firm's latestreport ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility nocredit for the completion and "actually penalized us bysuggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed."    Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power couldhave saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts,seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner.    He said this would have delayed completion of the plant foranother year "and it would have cost several hunderd milliondlrs more."    Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs byschedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said "First, we havethe best concrete placement record in the industry, Second newgovernment regulations after the Three Mile Island incidentsignificantly increased construction time.

reut2-015.sgm, FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED, Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years. Reuter&#3;

On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 inthe month to end-March to 692,200. In March 1986 the figure was725,000.    A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed asmaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,because of particularly cold weather delaying work in thebuilding industry.

reut2-015.sgm, ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY, Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct willpropel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to recordprofits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,major company executives predicted.    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and anindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAFCorp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firmsto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, theKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping formoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy.    "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," saidPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,"There's no major plant capacity being added around the worldnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones."    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said.    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory.    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"Oreffice said.    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace's John Dosher.    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports.    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s.    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts.    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may beheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back onthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such asethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals thatare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.    "Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent thepast two or three years trying to get out of the commoditychemical business in reaction to how badly the market haddeteriorated," Dosher said. "But I think they will eventuallykill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the nichemarket." Some top chemical executives share the concern.    "The challenge for our industry is to keep from gettingcarried away and repeating past mistakes," GAF's Heymancautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may beill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by theSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the Texas Gulf Coast.    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products.    "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business," Cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually.    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemicalbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided theU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth. Reuter&#3;

"As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, theyare rumors and we're not commenting on rumors," spokesman MichelDufour told Reuters in response to a query.    "All the information that has been given out publicly isthat, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making anacquisition that big...probably based on that people arestarting all sorts of rumors," he said.    Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only arumor, but said the company was not prepared to commentfurther. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bellwas out of town and unavailable for comment.    Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln-U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln-U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.    Dufour said the company has been negotiating with "many"U.S. textile companies but would not say whether BurlingtonIndustries was one of them.    Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor AsherEdelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making atakeover offer.

reut2-015.sgm, COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES, Major cocoa exporters are likely tolimit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost worldprices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa ProducersAlliance (CPA) said.    The sources said the depressed world market had been one ofthe main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the11-member CPA which began on Monday.    They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid thebuffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in hiseffort to support prices.    Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreedoperation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in Londonlast month and the stock manager is expected to enter themarket soon.    Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoasurpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager hasto buy cocoa under stock rules.    The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set rangeby buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.    "The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,"commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.    Another source said that with much of the 1986/87(October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales inthe near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.    The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry inBrazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major WestAfrican producers, where sales are made or authorized bycommodity marketing boards.    The CPA includes the world's top three producers, IvoryCoast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.    The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING, J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said itsfirst-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting itspreviously announced decision to place on non-accrual statusits 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interestpayments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in thefirst three months of 1986.    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securitiesunderwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mlndlrs in the year-earlier period.    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other tradinglosses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading andunderwriting of Euromarket securities.    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remaineddifficult last quarter, with floating rate notes sufferingheavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whetherMorgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loanlosses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreignexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln andtrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees andcommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but netinvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the firstquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fellto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which meansthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments areactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resumepayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance forcredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs comparedwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs aftercharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a yearearlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related topersonnel costs, Morgan said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS, Storage problems with Brazil's recordgrain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mlntonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of thisyear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable inharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storageproblems.    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,theoretically sufficient for the crop.    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badlydistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity.    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said.    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crophas been evident from television reports, which have shownenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries. Reuter&#3;

"The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad abusiness as you might imagine," senior Polish governmentspokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm.    Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture atthe Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week thatPoland would soon offer shares to private citizens in statecompanies in a bid to make the economy more responsive.    This was part of a major economic reform to be announced inthe coming weeks, he said.

He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club,grouping Poland's main government creditors, would shortlysolve the problem of short term servicing.    Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering theexpansion of the national economy, but that the new plans foreconomic reform would "open new vistas for Polish exports."

reut2-015.sgm, TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR>, The largest U.S. textile maker focusedon its own business as its competitors found merger partners,but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itselfinto an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.    The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman andDominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pctstake.    A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointlyacquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeoveroffer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman forMontreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors."    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced ofthe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors ifBurlington actually came into play.    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that itwas looking for a takeover in the U.S.    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Millsand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used fora U.S. acquisition.    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producerhas been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies, butwould not say whether Burlington was among them.    "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's notunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after thehousecleaning they've done," said Eileen Gormley of ThomsonMcKinnon.    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheetsand other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrslast year. It also has reorganized management, and focused itsoperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreigncompetition, Gormley said.    "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrialfabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpetsand other fabric to the auto industry.    "In the past, they just spent and never realized the returnon the outlays they did make," she said.    "You look at their record over the year, and I thinkthey're poised to be more profitable than they had been in thepast," Gormley said.     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, upfrom 2.01 dlrs per share.    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlingtonat its current levels.    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommendsselling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earningsbasis.    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have beenplaced on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.    "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of peopledon't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcingmanagements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even ifhe doesn't win the target company.    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for LuckyStores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buyingPonderosa Inc.    The stocks of other textile makers rose along withBurlington.    J.P.

reut2-015.sgm, JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS, Senior Japanese officials tomorrowopen talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditcheffort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a widevariety of Japanese electronic exports.    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days ofmeetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, MichaelSmith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.    The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are inretaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement toend dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost andto open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.    They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,including television and audio equipment and computers.    Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was littlelikelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pctduties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.    President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials thatJapan was not honoring the agreement.    In making the annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed tothe full enforcement of our trade agreements designed toprovide American industry with free and fair trade."    Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan'ssemiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injuredthe U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which hascomplained about presidential timidity on trade issues.    Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressivetrade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan'sinaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which lastyear reached 169.8 billion dlrs.    About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.    Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning toadhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.    Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposalsbut did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.    He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan'sdecision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated senseof MITI's power to control Japanese traders.    "The United States has excessive expectations.," he said. Tostabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted byexcess inventories since 1985 will take some time."    He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enoughin trying to sell in the Japanese market. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION, Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hopedto maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth tothe 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despitecontinuing investments in a reorganization program and effortsto extend world penetration.    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mlnguilders, after 265 mln in 1985.    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe'sleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weakerforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including theincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El AguilaS.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularlyin French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. Thecompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year inrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profitnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations hadalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by theEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beerinto the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beermarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "Wehave the beer, but distribution and sales is the importantpoint," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heinekenhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.    "The question is not if we want to penetrate the Germanmarket, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding thatwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing ataste for foreign beer, the internal structure was veryregionalized.     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible forAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the mostimportant beer growth markets in the long term.     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and withmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, washampered by the lack of hard currencies there.    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine litersper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictionsand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total1986 sales.    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high priceof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientistshave been looking at other possibilities.    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched onthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, whichhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional rawmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer werepopular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could notpossibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said.    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts topenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in acontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken'smarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow thatare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept westernmoney. Reuter&#3;

"Shareholders are betteroff if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividendsor share repurchases," he said.    Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the totalworldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.    He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeuticproducts, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters andlasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and willdouble that by 1995.    Wallin said, "Our objective is to get a hold of newproducts and start building market share if we have to beg,borrow or steal to get into new markets."    In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued witha number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulatorsalso have criticized the industry, citing quality problems anda needless overprescription of pacemakers.    "We have no knowledge of any major problems in ourpacemakers or leads," Wallin said. "We intend to re-establishour company as the quality leader in the industry."    Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, saidthe company intends to diversify internally and throughacquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,such as drug delivery systems.    Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 doesnot include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have somesafety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutionsfrom an acquisition."    Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivityin rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.

AbuZayyad has been namedpresident of its ROLM Corp subsidiary, succeeding Dennis D.Paboojian, who remains with IBM as a consultant.    The company said IBM vice president Paul R. Low has beennamed president of the IBM General Products Division,succeeding AbuZayyad, and IBM vice president Michael J. Attardohas been named president of IBM's General Technology Division,succeeding Low.    A Rolm spokeswoman said Paboojian decided to step down forpersonal reasons.    His decision, she said, was not related to IBM's move lastmonth to merge Rolm's sales and service organization into itsown marketing corps.    That merger was viewed by some analysts as reducing Rolm'sindependence and relegating it to a role as a manufacturing andproduct development site within IBM.    "He wanted to take some personal time off," she said,adding that Paboojian had taken part in the merger decision.    Scores of Rolm veterans have left the company, which makestelephone exchanges and other communications equipment, sinceit was acquired by IBM in 1984.    Rolm's highly respected founder, Ken Oshman, left more thana year ago.    Rolm and IBM customers have complained about a lack ofcoordination between Rolm and IBM, and analysts estimate theunit lost money last year.    But the spokeswoman said Paboojian was "happy with the waythings are going with Rolm." She said the unit posted its bestfourth quarter revenues ever in the 1986 fourth quarter. Reuter&#3;

They said the 17-member Commission, which effectively runsthe Community on a day-to-day basis, appeared divided over theproposals which some people argue could lead to nationalcapitals having too much say in EC farm policies.    EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen is proposing payingfarmers as much as 2,800 dlrs a year over five years to leavethe land. EC member states would be permitted to top uppayments to the poorest farmers to 80 pct of the averagenational farm income.    The package would also include an early retirement scheme,details of which have yet to be unveiled.    Andriessen's aim is to make a restrictive price policy --the centre-piece of a current battle to curb unwanted foodproduction -- more acceptable to countries with large farmingcommunities.    With two-thirds of the EC's entire 39 billion dlr budgetswallowed up by EC farm supports, he argues that in thelong-run the payments would lead to considerable savings. Reuter&#3;

"Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and weneed to get a clarification out," the spokesman said, addingthat there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be releasedtoday.    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.    Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for severalweeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developerDonald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he alsoheld discussions with its chairman.    The developer indicated in those talks that he took theposition as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buyingUAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2mln shares.    "United has got to consider this proposal. I think thepilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,but it could put some interesting options in front of UALmanagement," said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attackwhen it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertzrental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in astrategy to become a travel service company.    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots unionconcerned that the company was not focussing enough attentionon its airline.    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing itsnew focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street hasbeen busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL aswidespread, indicative to them that big institutions believethe stock is in play.    Market sources have said that although Trump attractedattention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as acatalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhapsthrowing the company into the hands of another buyer.    "The first domino is you have an investor with aconsiderable stake. the second domino is the union. That typeof attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"said Pettee.    "What's interesting is the values are there. There'ssomething for everybody," he said. Reuter&#3;

"In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also amost desireable development," he said in a speech prepared fordelivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,Calif.    A text was released in Washington.    He said the effect of lower inflation and financialderegulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.    "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modestlevels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowedafter mid-January.    "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregateswere to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year aswell," he added.    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.    "The pricing behavior of American producers in response toprice increases of their foreign competitors will be crucialfor our economic future," he said.    Widespread domestic price rises in response to risingimport prices would "generalize the inflationary forcesemanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain moremarket share for U.S. producers.    "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well bethe result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.    He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to bedisciplined in our conduct of monetary policy."     Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscaldiscipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint ratherthan new taxes.    "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindleinflation and certainly would not make us more competitive ininternational markets," Heller said.    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pctduring 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated withCanada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing Americanproducers to compete more effectively in that country," Hellersaid. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY, The U.S. meat and poultry inspectionprograms are incapable of protecting consumers fromcontaminated products, groups representing inspectors andconsumers charged.    "The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years hasbeen to corrupt and to degrade the system where today thepublic is at constant risk to contaminated and adulteratedmeat," Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation ofGovernment Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.    "The American consumer has little reason to feel confidentabout the safety of meat and poultry being offered to himtoday," said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the CommunityNutrition Institute.    "Company management is less concerned about the risk tohealth than about raising plant output and company profits,"Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee onLivestock, Dairy and Poultry.    Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the GovernmentAccountability Project, said inspectors consistently discloseviolations of federal law, demonstrating a "serious breakdown inthe entire inspection system."    Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring beingcontaminated by "intestines dragging in a water trough used toflush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blowtheir noses."    Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defendedthe government's program, calling it "one of the most respectedpublic health programs in the world."    FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5billion chicken and turkeys every year.    Houston said inspection programs have kept pace withchange, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues inthe meat and poultry supply has increased.    He also said that, although he was confident the bacteriumsalmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take timeand much money to contain the growing problem.    Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, isfound in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of rawpork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.    The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.    "We certainly really have not found an effective means ofturning this disease around," said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)    The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSISintensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures fordetecting microoganisms.    But the meat and poultry industries have said such controlswould cost too much.    "Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarilycomplicated procedures that may become obstacles to the realgoal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious andeconomical meat supply for consumers," Stanley Emerling,executive vice president of the National Association of MeatPurveyors, said.    Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a newprogram allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions atcertain plants "voids the law in letter and spirit, and must berepealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemicof death and illness for which there will be no prevention norlegal recourse."    Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said thepanel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2. Reuter&#3;

The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault onMarch nine set April nine as the target date for completingnegotiations.    However, the letter also allowed room for an extension ofthat date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.    The two companies said they "now plan to complete work byApril 23."    Chrysler and Renault said, "Given the complex nature of thedeal, the need for additional time was to be expected."    The March letter of intent between the two companies saysthat Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date"in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discoversan unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'investigation of the company," referring to American Motors.    A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problemhad cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company'sstatement that more time was needed because the talks arecomplex. "That is our definition of the delay," she said.    Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine orwhen an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendendby a written agreement by both companies.    The Chrysler spokeswoman said, "We are still working towarda definitive agreement." Said another Chrysler official who isnot part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were introuble: "There are no glitches."    Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay.

General Electric cited the strong results in TV network andstation operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which wasnot part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason forits strong earnings.    It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit wasmuch higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipmentsthan the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.    Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's firstquarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion ofRCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.

As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line againstinflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit withoutsubverting national U.S. economic policy.    "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,because the trade deficit is not responding, the United Statesdecided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet theircommitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do itspart by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report.    "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession orseriously higher interest rates, securities market participantshave seen little to fear," Wojnilower said.    He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency ratesand bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanesewindow dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.

Values dropped 12 pct in 1985, it noted.    Real values, which are adjusted for inflation, alsodeclined less than in 1985, because of the low rate ofinflation in 1986.

The department said in the Corn Belt and Northern Plains,which suffered severe losses in the past five years, declinesappear to be moderating. Also there are reports of stablevalues in some areas of the Corn Belt, it noted.    The continuing downturn in values reflects the largeacreage of land offered for sale relative to demand, concern about lower crop prices, and uncertainty over farm programs,the department said.

reut2-015.sgm, DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT, Financial analysts say they arepleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federalbudget deficit but believe the actions will do little to helpimprove the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrowto approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the comingfiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a planthat would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs nextyear.        "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs isinfinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have littleimpact on the economy and the trade deficit," said StanleyCollander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.    "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collandersaid in an interview.    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedlytold Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long wayto help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help easesome of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the tradeimbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volckerhas warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraughtwith danger.    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation asimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreigncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with othermajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value ofthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange ratesshould be stabilized at around current levels.    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed totake steps to stimulate their economies and the United Statesagreed to cut its budget deficit.    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as away to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, isto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.    "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything elseyou do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recenttestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten thegovernment's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the creditsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures orto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the UnitedStates.    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off thecurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressedthat any deficit reduction was better than none.    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility itneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollarfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.    "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but ifyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve theFed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answeris, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government'smost vexing and persistent problems.    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yetlittle indication that this year's figure will be any lower,though administration officials have predicted it will drop byabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleepworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from thefederal budget.    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is notattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set forthe 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balancedbudget law.    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs fornext year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate BudgetCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fallshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.    "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about themost you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time,said Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than thatwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end upshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.    "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptablereduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will nowlook like a failure to Wall Street."    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor wouldlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the yearbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cuttingdefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from theiranticipated spending levels for next year.    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit ofnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts. Reuter&#3;

Speaking to reporters at the Brazilian Embassy, Funaro saidhe would not seek approval of Brazil's economic program outsidehis country, but added, "At the same time we show credibility,you (the banks) are going to have to trust us."    Asked if creditor banks would accept Brazil's refinancingneeds based on a new economic program not endorsed by theInternational Monetary Fund, Funaro said, "What other options dothey have?...They have to try to see our program."    Funaro, who is in Washington to attend the InterimCommittee and Development Committee meetings of the World Bankand IMF, said he unveiled his refinancing proposals to themajor creditor banks in New York yesterday.    According to Funaro, the creditor banks "agreed on the needto find a solution to the crisis." He did not elaborate.    Funaro said the commercial banks agreed on Brazil's needfor economic growth and added that creditors were aware thatBrazil cannot continue to export the 24 billion dlrs in netcapital that it transferred over the past three years.

reut2-015.sgm, BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION, Bundesbank board member Claus Koehlercalled on central banks of major industrialised nations tocooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-releasedhere, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation wasprotectionism and control on capital movements.    "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange markettransactions to steer exchange rates where they want to havethem," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts wouldhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar dropto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange marketshad parted company with transactions in goods, services andinvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions thatdetermined market trends.    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates togrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rateswould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity," Koehler said.    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciationgoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steeprise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the costof European imports. But the volume effect of falling importsto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time tomake itself felt compared with the price effect.    "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be goingfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current accountover the medium term," Koehler said.    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occuronly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand shouldrise faster than GNP.    "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to beprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset byan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..    But only if there was an appropriate interest ratedifferential would Europe and Japan look for financialinvestment in the U.S.    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bankhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact itsmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market ratesby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leadinginterest rates because of the signal this gives to the marketand its substantial impact on exchange rates.    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals ofprice stability, economic growth and full employment but alsoto tackle international problems like the exchange rateproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.    A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguardingof non-inflationary economic growth in an internationalmonetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it wasnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficedto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates overthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,because they were only testing points for the market, he said.    In order to keep the international monetary system free ofdisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly butalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said. REUTER&#3;

"We have no idea about the report and cannot comment," aspokesman told Reuters.    Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngand U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of itsintentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month forfarm talks.    The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issueat the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradetalks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.    Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the FoodstuffControl Act.    Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries aboutmounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japanwill try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy isjustified, it said.

reut2-015.sgm, N.Z. GOVERNMENT POPULARITY RISES AHEAD OF ELECTION, New Zealand's ruling Labour Partygovernment has just completed its three-year economic reformwhich threw thousands of people out of work, yet its popularityhas risen as the September deadline for the election drawscloser, a recent poll shows.    An Eyewitness/Heylen Poll, conducted for Television NewZealand's Eyewitness news broadcast on April 2, showed Labourhad the support of 50 pct of voters compared with theopposition National Party's 46 pct.    The figures had been reversed in a poll a month earlier.    The poll showed 40 pct of the canvassed voters thought theeconomy would improve over the next year, up 12 points on lastmonth's result.    The increase came in a week when the government turnedseven departments into nine profit-oriented corporations run bybusinessmen who promptly sacked some 4,000 employees, includinghalf the country's 1,700 coal miners.    The latest survey confounded those who proclaimed Labour'sdays were numbered because of perceived insensitivity to itstraditional backers, the workers, political analysts said.    The poll indicates people are swinging behind the party andthe arguments of Finance Minister Roger Douglas, who haspresided over the deregulation of the economy and theconstruction of one based on market forces without subsidies orcurrency controls, the analysts said.    The economic reforms, by a party increasingly regarded inNew Zealand as more akin to the West European-style SocialDemocrats than working class socialists, have rattled theNational Party, which is now regretting it was not asinnovative in the decade it ruled until Prime Minister RobertMuldoon was ousted in 1983, one analyst said.    The National Party was further shaken, the analyst said,when the Press, a Christchurch daily, said on April 2 the partywas "on the verge of flying apart" with the prospect of a coupattempt against leader Jim Bolger by Muldoon. Bolger said thearticle was an April Fool's joke.    Labour's reforms have brought unexpectedly strong taxrevenues, a lower budget deficit and less state borrowing, animprovement in the balance of payments, a reduction in foreigndebt and improved productivity, economists said.    Inflation should peak at 19.5 pct in the quarter endedMarch 31 and fall to about eight pct within a year, they said.    Labour's reforms have hit every sector, but the mostdramatic was the "corporatisation" of seven governmentdepartments on April 1, which critics argue is the first stagestep towards the sale of state assets, the analysts said.    The move stops short of privatisation, as the state willretain ownership, but the new corporations are expected to befinancially self-supporting and pay dividends.    Arguments have already broken out over money. One utility,Electricorp, said its assets are worth less than 3.8 billiondlrs yet the Treasury wants 8.5 billion for them.    No agreement has been reached on the value of assets of theformer forest service, the analysts added.    Chairman Alan Gibbs said in a speech the forest service hadbeen losing 100 mln dlrs annually, yet due to economies it nowemployed less than 30 pct of its previous workforce and the newcorporation would pay the state a dividend of at least 20 mlndlrs in its first year.    Uncertainties have also arisen over the government, as theonly shareholder, retaining the right to order the newcorporations to undertake certain projects although the fullcost must be met by the state, the analysts said.    Deputy prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said managers wouldbe held accountable for performance, with the government payingfor projects undertaken for social or environmental reasons.    This policy has already caused problems, the analystsadded. For example, Electricorp has refused to spend severalhundred million dlrs to build a hydro project at Luggate,further up the Clutha river from the Clyde high dam now underconstruction in Central Otago.    Prime Minister David Lange said this week that Labour MPshad decided last year that Luggate be built and it wasimportant that the government honour its promises.    "But it is also a matter of importance that we do not seemany more jobs lost because of economic distortion than wewould save by having that promise honoured to the last," headded. REUTER&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY, Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts andTelecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international forceto be reckoned with, political analysts said.    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control ofa lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,they said.    "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control ofa key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"said one diplomatic source.    "They are a potent political force," the diplomatic sourcesaid.    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does notalways help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analystssaid.    "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were notso internationalized," said Waseda University professor MitsuruUchida. "Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the worldcommunity and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how toface the situation."    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row withLondon over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keepa major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete inJapan's lucrative overseas telephone business.    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rivalgroups, arguing the market cannot support more than onecompetitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which nowmonopolizes the business.    It has also opposed a major management role in the plannedmerger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm onthe grounds that no such international precedent exists.    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which hasthreatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the mergerplan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to openits telecommunications market.    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which itsays have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's cartelephone and satellite communications market.    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of thesector it regulates.    "What has been happening is an important shift in theeconomy which makes the ministry a very important place," saidJames Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia AdvisoryService Inc.    A decision to open the telecommunications industry tocompetition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boostedrather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.    "With the legal framework eased, they became the de factolegal framework," said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst DarrellWhitten.    Close links with the powerful political faction of theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former PrimeMinister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, theanalysts said.    "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanakafaction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importanceof MPT," Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members ofthe influential political group, he added.    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due tothe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in thePostal Savings System, analysts said.    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulateinterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financialliberalisation, since the change would remove the PostalSavings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates thanbanks, they said.    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT'sobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterizedthe ministry as feudal.    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limitingcompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under itswing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowestprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those ofits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western worldincluding Britain, several analysts said.    "The United States is really the odd man out," Abegglen said."For a government to take the view that it wants to keep orderin utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonableview," he said.

reut2-015.sgm, MEMBERS OF JAPAN'S RULING PARTY SHUN NAKASONE, Members of prime minister YasuhiroNakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have shunnedhis support in their campaigns for upcoming local elections.    "His presence will do more harm than good," an LDP candidatein Tokyo told Reuters. The candidate is one of severalconservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcryagainst Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax.    Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step downbefore the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10if the LDP lost too many major local seats.    Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led hisparty to its greatest-ever election victory last July, andanalysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline.    Over 2,500 local seats will be filled during two rounds ofpolling. The first round is on Sunday, the second on April 26.    Political analysts said a seat to watch would be thegovernorship of Fukuoka, southern Japan. The LDP and two centreparties are challenging the incumbent governor, Hachiji Okuda,who is supported by the opposition socialist and communistparties.    The proposed tax is a key campaign issue.    "The LDP and the centrist parties should have about1,350,000 votes against 700,000 for Okuda. But Okuda is theincumbent and has the sales tax weapon," said Rei Shiratori,professor of political science at Dokkyo University.    "Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October ifthe LDP wins in Fukuoka," he said.    Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win thegovernorship of the northern island of Hokkaido.    But Kenzo Uchida, professor of political science at HoseiUniversity, said, "Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough ifthe LDP loses only in Hokkaido."    The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the salestax proposal.    The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan tooverhaul the tax system, which has remained unchanged for 36years.    It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanesedomestic demand and cut back on exports. Without the taxrevenue the government would have less to spend on stimulatingthe economy. REUTER&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, CHINA LIKELY TO JOIN GATT, DIPLOMATS SAY, China is likely to succeed in joiningGATT despite policies that contradict free trade, becausewestern countries support its entry, western diplomats said.    China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 tointegrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80pct of world trade.    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list ofdetailed questions to China next month at the start of long andcomplex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with itsapplication supported by the United States, Japan and theEuropean Community for political and economic reasons.    "The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would drawback the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was," he said.    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.    "If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept theSoviet Union," he said.    "China's agreement will be seen as a model for the SovietUnion. GATT is not a political body."    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,including China's pricing system and trade subsidies.    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs andpromote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establishthe real cost of goods because many prices are set by the stateand often contain subsidies.    "Even when you go in person to a factory or a company to tryto find out the real cost of something, officials do not giveyou a clear answer. The political meaning is evident. They donot want to answer," he said.    China's position, as set out in a memorandum to GATT inFebruary, is that it is gradually reforming its price system tobring prices in line with real production costs and replaceadministrative controls with market ones.    Another diplomat said countries with centralised economiessuch as Hungary and Yugoslavia had joined GATT. However, Chinawould not apply for membership on similar terms, but rather asa less developed country entitled to preferential treatment.    He added that the economies of Hungary and Yugoslavia aresmall, while China's is huge and its weight would be felt.    "It (China) is the world's number two producer of coal, forinstance," the diplomat said. "It could have a very large impacton world trade."    Another sticking point is the subsidies China pays itscompanies to export so it can earn foreign exchange to pay forvitally needed technology, equipment and raw materials.    A Japanese trader said China lost money on every tonne ofgrain it exported, because it had to make up the differencebetween a low world price and a high domestic price.    A western diplomat said an official of a foreign tradebureau of a major inland Chinese city told him export subsidiesmight be as high as 100 pct for some products.    "When I asked what the subsidy figure was for the wholecountry, he referred me to the Ministry of Finance, adding witha grin that they would not tell me," he said.    He said officials were unwilling to give figures because ofthe sensitivity of the subject.    "Unless something is done to change this, China will findmany countries in GATT putting restrictions on imports fromChina," the diplomat added.    In a major speech on the economy late last month, PlanningMinister Song Ping made an indirect reference to this problem.    "While trying to expand exports to earn more foreignexchange, we must improve economic accounting practices andreduce the cost of exports," he said.    One diplomat said China's freedom to change its foreigntrade and pricing system to bring them more in line with GATTprinciples could conflict with domestic pressures. China hassaid there will be no major price reforms this year followingwidespread discontent in 1985 and 1986 from a public used tostable prices since the Communist takeover in 1949.    "So the question is how fast and how thoroughly can Chinareform its economy?," the diplomat said. "How can it balance therequirements of GATT membership with domestic political needs?"    But he added the advantages of China's entry would in theend outweigh these problems.    "China's entry would force it to modernise and become more apart of the world economy," he said.    "Just as China would get increased access to foreignmarkets, so it would have to give more access to its domesticmarket to foreign countries." REUTER&#3;

Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech thatmonetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflowsrequired cuts in interest rates.    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president DieterHiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall belowits lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he wasnot making a forecast on interest rates, however.    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollargained slight background support from the speculation.    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the moneymarket this week, dashing some expectations that it may eitheroffer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rateand let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much lessthan the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pactexpired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank couldmove to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculativecapital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless ofwhether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity."    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of thegenerally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked thefirst time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as acounterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.REUTER^M&#3;

Mahlmann earlier told a press conference he would visitKyoji Kitamura, director-general of the Finance Ministry'sSecurities Bureau, to express the CBOT's concern that Japanesefinancial institutions and individuals are not permitted totrade on the CBOT. Mahlmann is on a two-week tour of Hong Kong,Tokyo and Sydney.    Mahlmann urged Japan to boost Tokyo's status as a worldfinancial center by promoting the internationalisation of itsfinancial industry.    The Finance Ministry is expected to allow local banks,securities houses and insurance companies to use overseasmarkets from this month, bond market sources said, butofficials would only say the issue was under study.    Initially, the ministry is likely to bar corporate andindividual investors due to their relative inexperience, and tolimit trading to instruments like currency, stock indexes, timedeposits and government debt futures, the sources said.    Mahlmann told reporters the CBOT will start evening tradingto coincide with Far East morning activity on April 30. But headded night sessions would not preclude the CBOT from forminglinks with Far Eastern exchanges, although nothing had beendecided.    Asked what type of financial futures would be appropriate,he cited products concerning debt and equity.    The CBOT evening session will run from 6:00 to 9:00 P.M.Chicago time (2300 to 0200 GMT), which is 8:00 to 11:00 A.M. InTokyo, and trading will be limited to four contracts -- U.S.Treasury note and bond futures and options, he said.    Yen bond dealers said a proposed link between CBOT and theLondon International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE),combined with yen bond futures listings on both, would multiplyvolume if trade was encouraged by Tokyo-based orders.    Healthy liquidity growth in cash yen bond markets overseasis a prerequisite for expanded futures trading, traders said.    LIFFE plans to list yen bond futures should go ahead fromSeptember, possibly coinciding with the CBOT, traders said.

reut2-015.sgm, G-7 COMMITMENT TESTS JAPAN'S WILL TO BOOST ECONOMY, The statement issued today by the Group ofSeven (G-7) industrialised nations has put Japan under greaterinternational pressure to stimulate its economy or face afurther rise in the yen, private economists and analysts said.    They said the communique reflected increased foreignfrustration with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and itstight-fisted fiscal policies in the past.    Unless Japan implements economic measures included in thestatement, foreign protectionist sentiment would grow and theyen would come under renewed upward pressure, they said.    The G-7 -- grouping the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada -- said in the statement they welcomedproposals announced by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party(LDP) for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate itseconomy and that Japan reaffirmed its intention to further openits domestic markets.    "It's rather unusual that only Japan was mentioned in thecommunique and promised something," said Takeshi Saito, generalmanager of Fuji Bank Ltd's research division. This showed howstrongly other nations want Japan to take concrete andeffective steps to redress its trade surplus, he said.    The statement referred to some details of Japan's proposedeconomic measures, such as early implementation of a largesupplementary budget exceeding those of previous years andunprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.    It did not mention any figure for the projectedsupplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amountto more than 5,000 billion yen for fiscal 1987, which compareswith 2,000 billion provided for the previous year.    "It signalled a clear shift away from the conservativefiscal policies of the past," said Kazuaki Harada, seniormanaging director of Sanwa Research Institute.    For the last five years the government has stuck to atight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuingdeficit financing bonds by 1990.    But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost itseconomy, hurt by the yen's extended rise, hurried thegovernment to hammer out a draft economic package and bring itto the latest G-7 meeting.    Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economyas the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead worldeconomic growth.    "The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadershiprole and we should recognize it," Harada said.    If Japan fails to meet such international expectations itwill invite some retaliatory moves, especially from the U.S.,Which may result in a further rise of the yen, analysts said.    The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan'scommitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to amore balanced world trade structure, they said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, JAPAN CRITICISED FOR "DUMPING" OF BANK SERVICES, Japan, which has been accused of dumpingeverything from steel to computer microchips on world markets,is now under attack for alleged cut-throat selling of a productof a different sort -- banking services.    At meetings here this week, Bank of England officialspressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations thatforeign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfairadvantage in world financial markets.    The technical banking talks coincided with, but wereseparate from, discussions between Japanese officials andBritish corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who leftTokyo yesterday for South Korea.    At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in variouscountries measure bank capital and how much capital banks mustput up to back up their loans.    It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms thebulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about whatelse should be included.    Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals canundercut them on loans and other banking services becauseTokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet.    The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage, Paul Hofer,head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan, told Reuters.    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido said, "Theysee us as very aggressive. We say we are just trying to catchup with them."    Earlier this year, the United States and Britain agreed toadopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capitalequivalent to at least six pct of total assets. The twocountries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan.    But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out littlehope that would happen soon as they just introduced newregulations governing capital ratios last May.    Under those regulations, banks have until 1990 to attain acapital ratio of four pct. But, in tacit recognition ofoverseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target forJapanese banks with overseas branches.    But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan'sbanks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings ofJapanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.    Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only havecapital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios arewell above six pct, especially after the recent record-breakingclimb of Tokyo share prices.    Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far toohigh by the ministry. Japanese banks would never be able torealize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sellthe shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say.    Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by sayingthat studies of the stock market over the last 30 years showthat prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level.    But the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise.Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held upapplications for bank licenses by Japanese financialinstitutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting oftheir hidden reserves.    The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with theFed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talkson the subject. REUTER&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE, European currency markets reacted quietlyto the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealersranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete tosurprise that the markets should have expected so much.    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currenciesand traded in a narrow range after the communique, whichreaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currencystabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remainingbroadly entrenched in its current trading range.    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase BankAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.    However, she said the dollar could break out of the rangewith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltdin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady againstthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,possibly to 140 yen.    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expectsa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curbunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negativesentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbankoperators to test the downside.    Concern that finance ministers and officials still inWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour ofcurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along withworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in thenear term, the traders said.    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at thecommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar'sdownward trend.    Traders in several centres said the market would look forfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks todefend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." TheU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.    However, some dealers said London-based operators would beunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the longEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers saidthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stablemarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extremevolatility seen in the first few months of this year.    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of thecommunique made clear the leading nations did not want afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvreaccord's supposed currency target range.    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets wereready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communiquecontributing to greater stability.    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a bigboost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said heexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marksin the next three months.    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, saidthe communique had been in line with realistic expectations andshould not have produced disappointment.    "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and tradepolicies to redress current imbalances are of a differenttimescale than currency markets operate on," the source toldReuters, "This is a political process which takes time."    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp inBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident oncurrency markets today. "Did people really expect a patentremedy?" he asked.    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was onlythe first in a series and said the market would watch carefullyin the next few weeks for any changes in positions.    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus wasnow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move byJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth couldlead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary inpushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming monthswhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle tosupport the Paris accord.

reut2-015.sgm, GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS, Remarks by central bankers raised somehopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchasepacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of amove in the near term, money market dealers said.    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterdaythat rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth fromspeculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state centralbank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lowerlimit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but thedrop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotmentthis week dashed some hopes of lower rates.    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday innew liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by thepact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates onrepurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour morediscreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather thanthe more public adjustment of leading rates.    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate andallow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the casesince it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it mayallow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.This should then flow back into the market as it is depositedwith banks.    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first sevendays of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above theestimated 51 billion required for all of April. REUTER&#3;

The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitmenton cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Pariswhen they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at thethen-current levels.    In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fallagainst the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases bythe Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading ataround postwar lows.    Japan has come under growing criticism from both the UnitedStates and European countries for its only modest efforts toopen its markets to outside competition and to reduce itsexports.    The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to opendomestic markets to foreign goods and services but did notelaborate.    It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that aroundcurrent levels their currencies are within ranges broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."

reut2-015.sgm, AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS, Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mlnguilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profitsfor 1987.    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billionguilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said itsrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and achange in accounting practice. It added that revenues wouldhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainlydue to its life insurance business.    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rosedespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums andhigher personal risks.    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damageinsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health andlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a changein accounting for U.S. Annuities.    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personalinvestment influences that it should be accounted differentlyfrom the more traditional insurances.    This change in accounting practice and another change toaccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mlnguilders.    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profitswere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initialcosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in TheHague.    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emergedin the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initialcosts for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON inMay 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by thesecosts and made only a small contribution to the group'sprofits.    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwillfor Monumental Corp.    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.  REUTER&#3;

The finance ministers and central bank governors ofseven major industrial countries met today.    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance oftheir economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthenedeconomic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit oftheir heads of state or government.    The managing director of the International Monetary Fundalso participated in the meeting.    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment tothe cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,and noted the progress achieved in implementing theundertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.    They agreed, however, that further actions will beessential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustainglobal economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.    In this connection they welcomed the proposals justannounced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japanfor extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan'seconomy through early implementation of a large supplementarybudget exceeding those of previous years, as well asunprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to furtheropen up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view thataround current levels their currencies are within rangesbroadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basicpolicy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementationof the Louvre Agreement.    They concluded that present and prospective progress inimplementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in thisstatement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation tofoster the stability of exchange rates.

reut2-015.sgm, G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA, Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmedtheir Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince themarket of their resolve.    At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawasaid the ministers and central bank governors did not believe atotally new statement was needed.    The speculative selling did not reflect economicfundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only areaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, hesaid.    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve hadconcentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially themark, had remained stable.    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since theParis accord was not worth being called fundamental.    "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expressionof 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.    The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within therange agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.    It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointinga level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,Miyazawa said.    Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in thestatement, he said Japan was exceptional among the sevenbecause the yen appreciated against the dollar while othermajor currencies largely have been stable.    He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party hasjusted adoped a package to reflate the economy while othernations are not supposed to produce new measures in a shortperiod since the Paris agreement.    Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanesesemiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7meeting and did not affect the currency talks.    The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developingcountries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiativeoutlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago. REUTER&#3;
reut2-015.sgm, YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE, The yen is likely to start anotheruneven rise against the dollar and other major currenciesbecause the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new,currency and bond analysts here said.    "Is that it? I was expecting something more than that," saidone trader at a major Wall Street securities company.    Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: "Themarket now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."    The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the daysjust before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlyingbearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meetingof the finance ministers and central bankers of the top sevenindustrialized nations in Washington.    After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued acommunique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement'sview that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistentwith economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stabilityshould be fostered around these levels.    The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.    "They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line withfundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in linewhen it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?," askedRepublic's Cohen.    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelledspeculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities areprepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level isstill inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.    Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that thekey psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of theauthorities' permissible range.    Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline wouldprobably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to propup the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open marketintervention and public comments.    Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank ofJapan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts ofdollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.    The sources said the market may also be wary of agressivelyselling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Tradedata. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billiondlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.&#3;
reut2-015.sgm, JAPAN BUSINESS LEADERS SAY G-7 ACCORD IS WORRYING, The leaders of two of Japan's top businessgroups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern toJapan because it shows the major industrial nations regard theyen's current level as appropriate.    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of EconomicOrganizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is wellabove adequate levels. He did not elaborate.    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee forEconomic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yenfrom rising further.    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates asthe yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishiharasaid.    G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.And West Germany said in a statement they consider theircurrencies are now within ranges broadly consistent witheconomic fundamentals.    Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare tointervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchangerates are stabilised at appropriate levels. REUTER&#3;
reut2-015.sgm, G-7 COMMITMENT TESTS JAPAN'S WILL TO BOOST ECONOMY, The statement issued today by the Group ofSeven (G-7) industrialised nations has put Japan under greaterinternational pressure to stimulate its economy or face afurther rise in the yen, private economists and analysts said.    They said the communique reflected increased foreignfrustration with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and itstight-fisted fiscal policies in the past.    Unless Japan implements economic measures included in thestatement, foreign protectionist sentiment would grow and theyen would come under renewed upward pressure, they said.    The G-7 -- grouping the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada -- said in the statement they welcomedproposals announced by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party(LDP) for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate itseconomy and that Japan reaffirmed its intention to further openits domestic markets.    "It's rather unusual that only Japan was mentioned in thecommunique and promised something," said Takeshi Saito, generalmanager of Fuji Bank Ltd's research division. This showed howstrongly other nations want Japan to take concrete andeffective steps to redress its trade surplus, he said.    The statement referred to some details of Japan's proposedeconomic measures, such as early implementation of a largesupplementary budget exceeding those of previous years andunprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.    It did not mention any figure for the projectedsupplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amountto more than 5,000 billion yen for fiscal 1987, which compareswith 2,000 billion provided for the previous year.    "It signalled a clear shift away from the conservativefiscal policies of the past," said Kazuaki Harada, seniormanaging director of Sanwa Research Institute.    For the last five years the government has stuck to atight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuingdeficit financing bonds by 1990.    But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost itseconomy, hurt by the yen's extended rise, hurried thegovernment to hammer out a draft economic package and bring itto the latest G-7 meeting.    Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economyas the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead worldeconomic growth.    "The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadershiprole and we should recognize it," Harada said.    If Japan fails to meet such international expectations itwill invite some retaliatory moves, especially from the U.S.,Which may result in a further rise of the yen, analysts said.    The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan'scommitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to amore balanced world trade structure, they said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE, European currency markets reacted quietlyto the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealersranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete tosurprise that the markets should have expected so much.    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currenciesand traded in a narrow range after the communique, whichreaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currencystabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remainingbroadly entrenched in its current trading range.    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase BankAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.    However, she said the dollar could break out of the rangewith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltdin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady againstthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,possibly to 140 yen.    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expectsa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curbunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negativesentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbankoperators to test the downside.    Concern that finance ministers and officials still inWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour ofcurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along withworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in thelong term, the traders said.    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at thecommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar'sdownward trend.    Traders in several centres said the market would look forfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks todefend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." TheU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.    However, some dealers said London-based operators would beunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the longEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers saidthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stablemarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extremevolatility seen in the first few months of this year.    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of thecommunique made clear the leading nations did not want afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvreaccord's supposed currency target range.    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets wereready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communiquecontributing to greater stability.    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a bigboost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said heexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marksin the next three months.

reut2-015.sgm, U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS, The United States, which has longsought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to besatisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development andallows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreementto stabilize currencies.    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announcedyesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrialpowers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs wasannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve ofMiyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday'smeetings of leading industrial nations.    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action"extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the ParisAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within rangesbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- thereforerepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation tofoster exchange rate stability.    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted centralbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt thedollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale ofintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recentyears.    Monetary sources also said they understood that SecretaryBaker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in thelight of the Japanese announcement.    They also said there was a growing feeling among thefinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation overmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-termdifferences in past meetings.    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything likethe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face ofyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from othercountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues thatmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalancebetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America'strade deficit have already taken place.    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cutthe budget deficit even though it is implied in thereafffirmation of Paris.    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts areessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall thatreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier thisweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A furthersharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly posesubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and couldundermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force thepolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germanywelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its owncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weakdollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, theJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on makingtheir policy coordination more binding and one, CanadianFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summitto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.    The United States and France, backed by the InternationalMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for alimited number of economic objectives such as growth,inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and currentaccount balances.    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result inconsultations between the countries on whether correctiveaction should be required.    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectiveshas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because itimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfullysounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limitcurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret rangesof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from therelatively free currency markets of recent years. Reuter&#3;

FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total worldgrain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the SovietUnion, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.    World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast torise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening theimpact of reduced production.

FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated ata record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than lastseason and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.

reut2-015.sgm, INDIAN STATE COMPANY BONDS PROVOKE COMPLAINTS, India's private businessmen say theyhave been placed on an unequal footing in raising money fromthe capital market because government companies are wooinginvestors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds.    Stock brokers and bankers polled by Reuters said althoughequity shares or debenture issues floated by private firmsprovide a higher return and shorter maturity, they are fastlosing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealthand income taxes.    Brokers said many investors are transferring funds intogovernment company bonds because of their tax-free status andeasy transferability.    About 100 private companies have postponed plans to issueequity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal1987/88 partly on account of fierce competition from publicsector bonds, a merchant banker said.    They included equity shares and rights issue worth onebillion rupees planned to be issued this month by TataFertilisers Ltd, he said, adding the issue has been postponedindefinitely.    "The government bonds are making serious inroads on theprivate sector companies' resources," said R. P. Goenka,president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce andIndustry.    "The discriminatory tax treatment should be done away withand equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobiliseresources from the market which is common to both," Goenka said.    A senior Finance Ministry official said government andprivate firms were free to compete to raise resources, addingit was not correct that public sector-issued bonds werepreventing private firms from raising money on the stockmarket.    "Debentures and equity shares floated by private companiesstill account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised instock exchanges," the ministry official said.    A spokesman at Bombay stock brokers Batliwala and Karanisaid government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees orabout 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government andnon-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.    The share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupeesmobilised in 1985/86, he said. "To save taxes, commercial banks,mainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investingtheir surplus funds in the tax free bonds," he said.    "Individuals who are very well off are also investing in thebonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are goingfor equities or debentures floated by private companies on aselective basis," the spokesman said.    The maturity period of government company bonds variesbetween seven and 10 years. No wealth or income taxes arepayable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pctinterest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^Mexceeds 7,000 rupees a year.    Equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by privatecompanies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or fromthe tax on income earned from them.    The government bonds are listed as securities but traded onIndia's four major stock exchanges. They can be sold freely onthe stock market by simple endorsement while debentures canonly be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.    Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom inthe stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal taxconcessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.    The National Thermal Power Corp, NTPC, was the firstgovernment company to issue the bonds to raise one billionrupees in January last year, breaking the monopoly of privatecompanies on the capital market. The seven-year NTPC bond wasoversubscribed three times, brokers said.    Official figures show bonds floated by government companieshave been heavily oversubscribed. More state companies havesought the Ministry's permission to issue them in comingmonths.    NTPC's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51billion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by theFinance Ministry.    The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupeeslast year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month theIndian Railway Finance Corporation's record susbcriptiontotalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.    In most cases, the government has allowed the companies tomaintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.    Goenka said that government bonds are making itincreasingly difficult for private companies to launch newequity or debenture issues. He said the government could atleast "fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised throughsuch bonds by the public sector."    Merchant bankers said the government is pressing statecompanies to borrow from the public by reducing financialsupport to them.    To ease its internal debt burden, the government hasreduced the budgetary support to development investment inabout 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figuresshow.

reut2-015.sgm, CHINA LIKELY TO JOIN GATT, DIPLOMATS SAY, China is likely to succeed in joiningGATT despite policies that contradict free trade, becausewestern countries support its entry, western diplomats said.    China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 tointegrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80pct of world trade.    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list ofdetailed questions to China next month at the start of long andcomplex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with itsapplication supported by the United States, Japan and theEuropean Community for political and economic reasons.    "The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would drawback the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was," he said.    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.    "If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept theSoviet Union," he said. "China's agreement will be seen as amodel for the Soviet Union. GATT is not a political body."    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,including China's pricing system and trade subsidies.    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs andpromote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establishthe real cost of goods because many prices are set by the stateand often contain subsidies. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, TALKING POINT/SEMICONDUCTOR BOOK TO BILL RATIO, The Semiconductor IndustryAssociation is expected to report the sixth straight increasein its three-month average book-to-bill ratio, reflecting acontinued modest recovery in the computer chip industry,semiconductor analysts said.    Semiconductor analysts contacted by Reuters put the Marchbook-to-bill -- which is the ratio of new orders to actualsales -- at around 1.15, up from a preliminary 1.13 in thethree months ended in February. The association is expected torelease its estimates later today or on friday.    The analysts said they expect strong March performance bothin new orders and actual sales.    Michael Gumport, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc,projected the three-month average of new computer chip ordersat about 835 mln dlrs, up from 788 mln dlrs in February.    He put three-month average sales at about 720 mln dlrs,also an increase from the 700 mln dlrs reported last month.    Gumport said average new orders over 850 mln dlrs would bea plus for semiconductor industry stocks, while orders under800 would be interpreted negatively on Wall Street.    Gumport said cut backs in Japanese computer chip productionare aiding U.S. chip maker orders and sales.    Edward White, analyst with E.F. Hutton Group Inc, saidwhile Japanese cut backs may be a small factor, their effectshould be more readily apparant in April and May.    White, who put the March book-to-bill ratio at 1.15-1.16,said the ratio might hit 1.20 later this spring, before showinga normal seasonal decline during the summer.    He forecast three-month average orders at 825 mln dlrs forMarch, with three-month average billings at about 711 mln dlrs.    "This says the industry is still in a phase of moderaterecovery...it is not dramatic yet," said White.    He said the industry still has not seen a pick-up in hightechnology capital spending needed to create a strong recovery.    He said a boost in spending on such big-ticket items asmainframe computers would enhance the recovery, which is nowfocused on personal and small business computers.    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Michael Kubiak agreed theindustry is showing a recovery trend, that while encouraging,is not dramatic.    Kubiak projected the March book-to-bill ratio at 1.14. Hesaid the three-month average for orders will be up about 4.5pct from last month, while shipments rise about one pct.    He noted, however, orders during the month of March alone,a statistic the Semiconductor Industry Association does notpublish, should show a 15-20 pct rise from February orders.    Kubiak said a book to bill ratio of 1.14 would have littleor no effect on semincondutor industry stocks, while a ratio of1.13 would be negative for the market and a ratio of 1.16 wouldlikely cause the stocks to rise.

He told a news conference Eurocheque cards can now be usedin 40 European and Mediterranean countries to back Eurochequeswritten in local currency and, where facilities are available,as electronic debit cards. The system would have 5,000automatic cash dispensers by the end of this year and aimed tohave 25,000 throughout Europe by 1992.    Eurocheques and cards are issued by banks in 21 countries.    Van Wauve said Italian banks, who already acceptEurocheques, had recently asked to be allowed also to issueEurocheques and cards to their clients. It was possible thesewould be launched in Italy this year if the Rome governmentagreed to lift exchange controls that prevent residents writingcheques abroad in any currency but lira, he told Reuters.    Eurocheque International, the system's Brussels-basedcoordinating centre, was also reviewing a request from theSoviet Union for permission to issue cheques and cards.    Eurocheque's agreements with banks do not permit them tocharge commissions from clients using Eurocheques, and VanWauwe said problems with French banks that have demanded suchcommissions had been reduced to a minimum last year.    Eurocheques can also be used to pay in local currency forgoods and services bought in over five mln retail outlets in 28countries, with Hungary, Tunisia and Greece added to the systemthis year. East Germany last year became the 40th country toaccept Eurocheques, made out in dollars, at banks and shops.

Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarksyesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and WestBerlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealerssaid, revived some speculation that German interest rate cutsmay once again be under discussion.    Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of histwo central bank council colleagues.    But he added that the last central bank council meeting onApril 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of"subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news broughtby several state central bank presidents.    "Much is going better than the impression gained by thepublic from the January figures, which have been in themeantime superseded," he said.    German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after adecline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9pct after they had been unchanged in December.    Bank economists said that the two together showed theeconomy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarterof 1987.    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, asteady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/markrate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl OttoPoehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMFmeeting.    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rateson repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchasetender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, "Since the centralbank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14days, this is hardly probable."    Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had movedaway from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one oftargetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have nocomment on the subject while negotiations were still inprogress in Washington.

reut2-015.sgm, U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS, The United States, which has longsought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to besatisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development andallows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreementto stabilize currencies.    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announcedyesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrialpowers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.    And the initial reaction of currency markets in the FarEast demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced thatcurrencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though thecountries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one pointdespite intervention by the Bank of Japan.    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said themovement since Paris was consistent with currency tradingranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.    "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the pastseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in thediscussions in Paris," Miyazawa said yesterday.    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs wasannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve ofMiyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday'smeetings of leading industrial nations.    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action"extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the ParisAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within rangesbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- thereforerepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation tofoster exchange rate stability.    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted centralbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt thedollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale ofintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recentyears. Monetary sources also said they understood thatSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremelysuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.    They also said there was a growing feeling among thefinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation overmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-termdifferences in past meetings.    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything likethe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face ofyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from othercountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues thatmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalancebetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America'strade deficit have already taken place.    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cutthe budget deficit even though it is implied in thereafffirmation of Paris.    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts areessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall thatreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier thisweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A furthersharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly posesubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and couldundermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force thepolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germanywelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its owncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weakdollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, theJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on makingtheir policy coordination more binding and one, CanadianFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summitto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.    The United States and France, backed by the InternationalMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for alimited number of economic objectives such as growth,inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and currentaccount balances.    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result inconsultations between the countries on whether correctiveaction should be required.    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectiveshas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because itimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfullysounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limitcurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret rangesof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from therelatively free currency markets of recent years. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS, The global economy is expected toweaken this year, adding new worries to an already seriouspoverty outlook, economic analysts said.    For finance ministers and central bankers attending thisweek's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fundand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add anadditional concern.    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pctthis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, ameasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0pct from 3.5 pct last year.    The new figures are considered a major disappointment tothe poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in theindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oilprices would assist their economic recovery and help them copewith growing mounds of debt.    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believedthe industrial country economies would move up to an annualgrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for sometime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning intoan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthierstates for markets for their products as well as financialassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' economies poses fundamental worries.    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, haveonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,including the key one of exports.    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but ittoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only2.3 pct, according to the IMF.    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, theUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany toignite their economies but with little apparent success.    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar andthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. tradedeficit.    Reagan administration officials have been saying that theimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been muchslower than expected.    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it hasto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time towork through to payments flows -- probably at least three yearsto get a resonably complete effect."    The report added, however, "the adjustments may take evenmore time on this occasion."REUTER^M&#3;
reut2-015.sgm, SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES, The head of Spain's employers'federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worriedabout the government's monetary policies because high realinterest rates were hampering investment.    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far thisyear were not endangering the government's five pct inflationtarget. The government's perceived need to control inflation bykeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.    High real interest rates were attracting an influx ofspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting thegovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and atarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call moneyrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from11.8 at end-1986.    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call tohold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and newwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanishworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected thestate sector, where the government is trying to impose its fivepct wage ceiling.    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend inSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the firsttwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pctincrease over the corresponding period last year.    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of thepeseta to correct the imbalance. REUTER&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS, Lead prices have risen this week againsta background of a finely balanced physical sector, traderssaid.    Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buyingor if labour problems develop in North America, they added.    London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant ata time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening andprices tending to drift lower.    This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the lowlevel of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physicaldemand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.    The supply problems are not new but are beginning to befelt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traderssaid.    The lower supply levels result from a number of differentfactors around the globe.    Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countriesbecause of production and transport problems, lack of Spanishexports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter atLinares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meantadditional demand being directed to merchants who in turn havebeen drawing on LME stocks.    In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeksfor maintenance. Although the company said it would meetcommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnesper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocksand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within theU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production anda regular supplier to the world market.    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held upquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reportedin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in thefirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buyingorder was filled by merchants in March.    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead pricesthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg andestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three monthsdelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal inGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is oftena target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerpand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,and this is believed to be in strong hands.    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowestlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouseswhich are not popular with merchants putting togethershipments.    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes sincethe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due tosecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed suppliesaffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions onthe transport of used batteries.    Labour negotiations in North America will play an importantpart in determining the direction of prices, with contractsexpiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.    Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contractexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view ofstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attractingspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on currentfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premiumto 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg atmidsession. Reuter&#3;

Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterologicalsub-divisions of the country.    The report gave the targets for various crops withestimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grainsincluding sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it waspossible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifyinggrowing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along withgreater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement infertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, addingtotal foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4mln.   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnesof foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-yeardevelopment plan ending March 31, 1990.    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gapof 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining threeyears of the plan by increasing grain output annually by morethan nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only withgood weather, the report said.    "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread ofimproved technology including timely use of inputs (farmmaterials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to bevigrously pursued," it said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, UK, FRANCE TO URGE DEBT RELIEF FOR POOREST LANDS, Britain, France and other Europeannations will make a strong plea in high-level meetings todayfor urgent debt relief for the very poorest countries, Europeanmonetary sources said.    The request will be put to the International MonetaryFund's policy-making Interim Committee, which meets here aspart of semi-annual IMF and World Bank talks.    But it is likely to run into opposition from the UnitedStates, which regards debt relief, even for the world's poorestnations in Sub-Saharan Africa, with distaste.    "If all creditors agreed, (Britain and France) would beprepared to consider below market interest rates " for thecountries, one source said.    A senior U.S. Treasury official poured cold water on theplan earlier this week, however. "We are not willing to enterinto arrangements that would forgive debt or provideconcessional interest rates," the official said.    At the heart of the American objection is the fear thatonce such a concession is made for the very poorest nations,then sooner or later Latin debtors will be demanding similarrelief.    African nations owe foreign creditors, most of themgovernments, over 70 billion dlrs. Over 21 billion dlrs is debtowed by poorest Sub-Saharan African nations.    In addition to interest rate concessions, the sources saidEuropean countries wanted repayment of these loans to bestretched out for up to 20 years, with a substantial delaybefore capital repayments start.    The issue was inconclusively discussed in yesterday'smeetings of the major industrial nations -- the United States,Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    It is already under consideration by the Paris Club ofwestern creditor nations, to which the United States belongs.

The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed itwould pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on1986 business, despite the provision.    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currencydealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses fromthe currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, butthe VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory boardmeeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal indetail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreigncurrency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditingcompany.    VW has said computer programs were erased and documentswere faked in the alleged fraud in which it believestransactions intended to protect it against possible foreigncurrency losses were not completed.    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger wasarrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of havingevaded justice.    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks andparent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommendan unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company hasalso set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,which were issued last year. Analysts have described the helddividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5billion marks, with the result that its total dividend paymenton 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,since the new capital was in preference shares.    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves inorder to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. Atthe end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightlyless than three billion marks. REUTER&#3;

In a related action, Moreno downgraded his opinion of UALInc &lt;UAL> to accumulate from buy and took it off the firm'srecommended list, Smith Barney's spokeswoman said. The stockslipped 1/2 to 71-1/2 on volume of 1.3 mln shares.    She said the Moreno's downgrade of UAL was because the"stock had risen to a level beyond what current fundamentalscan support." The stock has risen more on merger speculationthan on fundamentals, the opinion continued.    In recent weeks, rumors UAL stock was being accumulated fora possible takeover bid shored up the stock, traders andanalysts said. In addition, pilots of UAL's United Airlinesunit proposed a buyout of the airline for 4.5 billion dlrs.    The Smith Barney spokeswoman said the postiverecommendation of AMR emphasizes the company's strong marketingability, its good management and customer loyalty to the AMRname. She said the company has been the best financialperformer of the airline group.    The AMR recommendation includes earnings expectations of4.35 dlrs a share in 1987 as compared to earnings of 4.63 dlrsa share last year, the spokeswoman said. In 1988, the companyis expected to earn six dlrs a share.

reut2-015.sgm, LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES, Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interestrates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.    Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Sevencountries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he saidcentral banks would continue to intervene "as and whennecessary."    He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do moreto stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined byJapanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of asimultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and WestGermany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budgetspeech to the British Parliament.    "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there isstill a risk," he said.    Asked if the United States should consider increasinginterest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is aneed for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need tobe a rise in interest rates in the United States."    Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday'smeetings at the slow progress the United States had made inreducing its budget deficit.    "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress inreducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that itcontinue year after year," Lawson said.    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts tostabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the sixweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise againstthe dollar despite massive central bank intervention.    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness inthe Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had beenno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawsonsaid, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode... but one has to be vigilant."    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that"current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been"carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean thesame thing," he said.    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanesemeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source ofweakness for that agreement.    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa'spresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulatedomestic demand.    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediateincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the packagealso involved a second stage to increase expenditures duringthe second half of this year.

It was in response to strong representations by the PotatoMarketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion ofprice which they say will result in large deliveries into thephysical market when the April futures position expires.    The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futurestrading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore therelationship between futures and physicals.    Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and corneringof the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigationsby the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), theInternational Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and otherparties, found no evidence to substantiate this.    The main complaint from some sections of the physicalmarket is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium overthe PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded thismorning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB'saverage price of 104 stg.    Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there isa two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said qualitypotatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been payingbetween 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesserquality grades have traded below 100 stg.    Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be deliveredagainst the April futures contract between now and the end ofthe month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.    Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the managementcommittee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpracticeand he assured the committee is monitoring the situation. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT, The dollar drifted down to end onepfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by thelack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting andcomments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.    Dealers said the communique early in the European morningfrom the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors andalthough the dollar dipped it generally resisted furtherattempts to push it lower through the day.    The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, belowyesterday's last 1.8365/75.    Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction wasbased on a global view, with operators paying most attention tocomments by finance officials to see how closely they statedadherence to international agreements such as those set at thePlaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.    Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7as "soft as wax."    Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters ina telephone interview that the German central bank sees nocurrent reason to change monetary course at present.    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarksyesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and WestBerlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealerssaid revived some speculation that German interest rate cutsmay be under consideration.    German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70pct after 3.80 yesterday.    Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections addedvia Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut nextweek. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocationat an unchanged 3.80 pct.    But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesingersaid, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on thistheme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."    Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankerscomments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.    Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965last night.

reut2-015.sgm, TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES, Steel stocks, which have had a healthyrunup recently, still present some short term investmentopportunities, according to some steel analysts.    But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firmprices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will endsoon. They recommend taking profits.    "It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal," saidCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. "Orders will bestrong for about two months, and there are signs that some(order rates) are starting to dive already."    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison seessome short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp&lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland SteelIndustries Inc &lt;IAD>.    "There is still some attractiveness to steels over theshort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates andrising prices," Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations tomake them more efficient.    Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues torecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.    Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balancesheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment businesshas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradfordnoted. "It's not a high-quality investment situation yet butthey've come a long way," he said.    "We think the stock will do moderately better than themarket," he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,against losses last year.    Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, hesaid.    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. "We had a buyon it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else haveit," he said.    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr ashare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, andfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. "But a lotdepends on oil prices," he added. About 60 pct of USX's salescome from oil and natural gas.    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum ofSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. "The company's done a lot(of restructuring), more than the market's given them creditfor," she said.    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX wastrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts ashare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in1986.    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, hasbeen recommending the stocks since last November.    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the groupalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through thethird quarter.    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. "I think (steel)prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,"he said.    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonaldropoff later in the year. "But there are more positives thannegatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domesticindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which shouldcause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

reut2-015.sgm, JAPAN CRITICISED FOR "DUMPING" OF BANK SERVICES, Japan, which has been accused of dumpingeverything from steel to computer microchips on world markets,is now under attack for alleged cutthroat selling of a productof a different sort -- banking services.    At meetings here this week, Bank of England officialspressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations thatforeign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfairadvantage in world financial markets.    The technical banking talks coincided with, but wereseparate from, discussions between Japanese officials andBritish corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who leftTokyo yesterday for South Korea.    At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in variouscountries measure bank capital and how much capital banks mustput up to back up their loans.    It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms thebulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about whatelse should be included.    Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals canundercut them on loans and other banking services becauseTokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet.    The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage, Paul Hofer,head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan, told Reuters.    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido said, "Theysee us as very aggressive. We say we are just trying to catchup with them."    Earlier this year, the United States and Britain agreed toadopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capitalequivalent to at least six pct of total assets. The twocountries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan.    But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out littlehope that would happen soon as they just introduced newregulations governing capital ratios last May.    Under those regulations, banks have until 1990 to attain acapital ratio of four pct. But, in tacit recognition ofoverseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target forJapanese banks with overseas branches.    But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan'sbanks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings ofJapanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.    Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only havecapital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios arewell above six pct, especially after the recent record-breakingclimb of Tokyo share prices.    Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far toohigh by the ministry. Japanese banks would never be able torealize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sellthe shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say.    Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by sayingthat studies of the stock market over the last 30 years showthat prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level.    But the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise.Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held upapplications for bank licenses by Japanese financialinstitutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting oftheir hidden reserves.    The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with theFed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talkson the subject. REUTER&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, LLOYD'S OFFERS CASH IN BID TO END PCW AFFAIR, Lloyd's of London has offered to meetpart of the 235 mln stg in claims that investors in PCWUnderwriting Agencies face due to fraud and mismanagement,chairman Peter Miller said at a press conference.    Miller urged 3,000 PCW members to accept the offer so thatthe five-year-old affair could be closed.    The members have until May 30 to accept the offer,involving a 103 mln stg payment by Lloyd's and some of Lloyd'sunderwriters in exchange for a 34 mln stg contribution from PCWmembers, he said.    Miller said that at end-1985, PCW syndicates had grossliabilities of 680 mln stg.    To offset this, they had assets, including cash andpayments from reinsurance policies on some of the risksunderwritten by the syndicates, of 445 mln stg, leaving netliabilities of 235 mln, he said.    The total sum on offer, including a 48 mln stg payment fromLloyd's 311 mln stg contingency fund and 55 mln stg fromLloyd's brokers who could otherwise face court cases for theirinvolvement in PCW, is designed to cover the full reinsurancecost for those 235 mln stg of net liabilities, Miller said.    Under the offer, which requires 90 pct acceptance, Lloyd'sitself would take over all members' future obligationsconnected with the PCW syndicates, Miller said. Members wouldhave to agree not to pursue the matter in court.    Miller said a rejection of the offer would probably lead toprotracted litigation in court which, even if succesful formembers, was unlikely to produce a better deal for them.    He added that acceptance would mean members could continueunderwriting in the Lloyd's market and qualify for tax reliefon the cash payments they would make towards the settlement.    Miller denied that PCW members would face bills of over200,000 stg.    He said only 34 members would be asked to pay between100,000 and 200,000 stg, and about 100 between 60,000 and100,000 stg. Special arrangements would be sought for those whoaccept the offer but are unable to pay.    Miller said the offer did not imply Lloyd's acceptedresponsibility for the affair, uncovered in the late autumn of1982 when "it became quite clear that (PCW agency founder) PeterCameron Webb and (his partner) Peter Dixon had perpetratedtheft upon members," he said.    Part of the sum involved was subsequently recovered andrepaid to members, but Cameron Webb and Dixon left the affairsof PCW syndicates "in a state of chaos which led to a sharpdeterioration of their underwriting results," Miller said. Bothwere fined by a Lloyd's disciplinary committee and expelledfrom membership.    He said Lloyd's would continue to seek reparation inBritish and U.S. Courts "with the utmost vigour ... To bring toa close one of the most shameful episodes in the history ofLloyd's," and was contemplating claiming the full amount of thesettlement now on offer from Cameron Webb and Dixon.    In a reaction, insurance brokerage Sedgwick Group Plc&lt;SDWK.L> said it supported Lloyd's proposals and hadcontributed 10 mln stg towards the proposed settlement.    It said in a statement, "as largest broker in the Lloyd'smarket, the company has an essential interest in maintainingthe reputation of the market. That reputation has been damagedby problems at PCW and will continue to be so as long as theyremain unresolved." It had contributed to the proposedsettlement to avoid costs related to the defence of some of itssubsidiaries which had been named as potential defendants tolitigation by PCW members, it said.

The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production.

reut2-015.sgm, U.S. TO PUSH STRONG SUMMIT AGRICULTURE STATEMENT, The United States will push for astrong statement from Western heads-of-state at the Juneeconomic summit in Venice, urging "comprehensive" negotiationson agriculture begin immediately to reduce domestic farmsubsidies, the senior U.S. planner for the summit said.    "Agriculture has really become the number one internationaleconomic problem," Allen Wallis, undersecretary of state foreconomic affairs, told Reuters in an interview.    At the Tokyo economic summit last year, western leadersidentified agriculture as a major international problem butmade no specific recommendations. This year, Wallis said theU.S. will press for a statement instructing trade ministers tobegin negotiating on the issue, and include domestic programs.    While the Western leaders, including president Reagan, willnot conduct specific negotiations, Wallis said they can give apush to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT).    Wallis said the leaders should endorse a "comprehensive"negotiation, which is interpreted as including domesticpolicies as well as import restraints and export subsidies.    "They (GATT talks) really have to deal with domesticpolicies, as well as trade arrangements," Wallis said.    Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said a summitstatement of support for agriculture talks is part of anoverall U.S. strategy to build momentum for the GATT farmtalks.    Public statements in recent weeks by several members of theReagan cabinet have stressed the agriculture issue.    Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng willrepeatedly discuss agriculture during a visit to Japan startingnext week. Yeutter said agriculture will also be on the agendaof the trade ministers "quadrilateral" talks amongJapan, the European Community, the U.S. and Canada this month.    And the ministerial meeting of the Paris-based Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, in May willhighlight the agriculture problem, Yeutter said.    The OECD in May is expected to release a study of domesticfarm subsidies which shows that Japan has the highest subsidiesamong industrial countries, but aid to farmers is also generousin the EC and United States.    The controversial OECD study calculated a measure of farmsubsidies called the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, whichallows farm aid to be compared across countries.    Some officials including British Agriculture MinisterMichael Jopling, have said the PSE could be useful as a methodof negotiating lower domestic farm subsidies worldwide.    However, the State Department's Wallis said while the PSEcan be useful in negotiations, it has shortcomings and "its notdefinitive."    He and other U.S. officials said the Reagan administrationhas not yet reached a decision on a specific U.S. agricultureproposal to present to the GATT.    "I would expect it (U.S. proposal) to be in the fall,"after the series of international meetings, Wallis said.    At preliminary meetings of the GATT agriculture committee,the United States has pushed for the so-called "freeze androllback" approach. Subsidies would first be frozen at currentlevels, then rolled-back jointly in stages.    However, the Reagan administration perplexed some tradeanalysts recently by reacting cooly to a plan by Australianprime minister Bob Hawke calling for a similar approach. Hawkeunveiled a seven-point plan to freeze and subsequently reducethe gap between high farm price supports and world prices.    Australia is leading a the so-called Cairns group of 13coutries pressing for freer agriculture trade.    "The proposals that the so-called Cairns group are comingup with seem to be focusing on short-run, quick fixes which isnot what we think is what's called for here," Wallis said.    Wallis and other said the U.S. wants a "long-range"solution to the agriculture problem.    U.S. officials also have criticized the Australian proposalbecause they said it deals primarily with the differencebetween domestic prices and world levels in the EC and U.S.,but fails to focus on the question of market access.    At the same time the U.S. is rejecting the Australian"quick fix", Wallis said the U.S. will press at the summit fora declaration urging that agriculture talks be completed"expeditiously", or within two years.    The unstated U.S. strategy, U.S. officials said, is to keepthe pressure on the EC this year through the export enhancementprogram and lower value of the dollar, in the hope that asweeping agriculture agreement is possible in 1988.

reut2-015.sgm, U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER, U.S. retailers' lackluster March saleswere due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect arecovery in April.    "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, butunderlying business is better than the numbers indicate," saidBear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.     Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. Thisyear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is threeweeks later than last year.    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and aseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted5.7 pct last year.    "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicatethat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appearto be because liquidity and employment are rising," saidanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming inaccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expectedto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticketitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to manyanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as theholiday nears.    "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect acontinuing strength in the housing market," said EdwardBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported anoverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women'ssportswear were also excellent.    "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but evena modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishmentdue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner.     J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> wereamong the weaker performers with comparable stores salesdeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store andcatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson'soverall sales rose 4.8 pct.    Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continuedstrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged fromvery active in the east to weak in the economically depressedsouthwest."    "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activitywear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of BearStearns.    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter forthe decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a toughercomparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lowerthan last year.    "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories arebeing kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but salesare coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning ofthe year.    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle ofMay.

reut2-015.sgm, LONDON EURODOLLAR BONDS CLOSE LOWER, Eurodollar bonds closed as much as a fullpoint lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against theyen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eightpct.    The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightlyafter foreign exchange traders in New York said the FederalReserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs ina seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points overcomparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close oftrading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slidein aftermarket activity.    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for anewly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrsat only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said thatbecause the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- thelast time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intendedto compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertaintycurrently associated with owning dollar securities.    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds indollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is theonly market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped intoyen as the borrowers previous issues were.    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its feesat less 1.75 less 1.55.    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering fromToshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by SekisuiChemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue hasequity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted onbrokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.    The Australian dollar market continued active, withCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mlnfive-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. Asimilar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightlyhigher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, wasquoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing toaccept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points lessthan annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retailbuyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest ratesfall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential forcapital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are alsobetter for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds areapparently being placed with retail accounts on the Europeancontinent with very little placement being done in Japan.    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices ondomestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade asthe yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to144 yen.    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyenissue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the secondseven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curvein Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced. REUTER&#3;

Under the proposal, if a farmer idled 20 pct of his acreagebase and was eligible to plant the remaining 80 pct, he wouldreceive payments on only 75 pct of his total base.    Current regulations provide farmers with deficiencypayments on 100 pct of their non-idled acreage.    Reducing the payment base by five pct could save around 400to 500 mln dlrs, but would have to be applied to the 1987 cropprograms in order for any savings to accrue in fiscal year1988, an Agriculture Department economist said.    Stenholm's aide said when the proposal is officiallyoffered, it would likely be an amendment to the budgetreconciliation bill.    Other options currently being talked about as a way to cutone to two billion dlrs from the farm budget include increasingacreage reduction programs, limiting farm payments,implementing a 0/92 acreage set-aside program or limiting theuse of generic in-kind certificates.

reut2-015.sgm, SWISS AGREE ON NEW PROSPECTUS RULES FOR NOTES, Swiss franc notes issued after May 1 mustbe provided with a prospectus, virtually erasing the differencein information requirements between notes and public bonds,according to a convention drafted by the Bankers' Federation.    The convention requires that lead managers draw up aprospectus naming all syndicate members and providing certaindetails about the borrower.    In contrast to public issues, though, the prospectus mustmerely be made available to clients on request via allsyndicate banks rather than published and distributed inprinted form.    The convention, which was approved by banks earlier thismonth, replaces an earlier convention dating from 1984 anddeals with what had been widely seen as an increasinglyanachronistic distinction between notes and public issues.    Its publication follows a long debate among bankers on theamount of information that should be provided by borrowers,heightened by difficulties with Swiss franc issues here onrecent occasions .    It applies to all notes in units of at least 50,000 Swissfrancs, the usual denomination, which are placed directly withcustomers by the syndicate and not quoted on the bourse.    Anything smaller than 50,000 francs will be governed by theunchanged, more demanding rules that apply to public issues.    Bankers contacted by Reuters said they did not envisagethat the new requirement would present them with problems orpush up fees. Many banks said that they had for some time beenproviding more than the legal minimum of information.    Traditionally, notes or private placements, as they werealso known, were medium term instruments denominated in 50,000francs and placed largely with institutional investors.    They were normally not brought onto the open market andnever quoted on the stock exchange.    But over the years the distinction between notes and thepublicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down. TheNational Bank therefore last May abolished all remainingrestrictions on maturities and denominations which stillformally divided them.    However, it was not in the competence of the National Bankto rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largelyas before: public issues, generally quoted on stock exchanges,have been provided with detailed prospectuses, while notes,virtually always not-quoted, have been equipped only with"information memorandums" with varying degrees of detail.    The new convention attempts to put an end to this. It sayseach notes prospectus must contain the following seven points:    - The precise terms of the issue    - Details of the company performance if it is more than sixmonths since the last annual report    - Naming of all guarantors    - The source of the information    - Details of ratings, insofar as they have been made    - For equity linked notes, details of where the company'sshares are listed and price high and lows over at least thelast three years.    - That the lead manager has required the borrower toprovide information during the lifetime of the notes on theprogress of his business.     According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp, total noteissues by foreign borrowers reached 18.6 billion Swiss francslast year, compared with 23.6 billion francs borrowed in theform of public bonds.    A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers. REUTER&#3;

The Colmar plant, Sony's third in France, would eventuallyuse local components and be a purely French factory, he said.     Sony France SA was established in 1973. Its 1986 saleswere two billion francs (327 mln dlrs) and the company says itexpects sales of 2.7 billion francs (443 mln dlrs) in 1987.Sony's other two French plants, in the south west of thecountry, export over 80 per cent of their production.

reut2-015.sgm, WARD CRITICISES GUINNESS'S FEE COMPLAINT, Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> director ThomasWard told a High Court hearing that the company's actionagainst him and ex-chairman Ernest Saunders sought to give theimpression of an international hunt for Ward's 5.2 mln stg feein connection with the Distillers Co Plc &lt;DIST.L> takeover, thePress Association news agency reported.    In a sworn statement, Ward, a U.S. Lawyer, said Guinnesshad failed to acknowledge that his attornies in March hadoffered to put the money, less tax and various expenses, intoan escrow account where it could only be touched under agreedcircumstances.    Ward said Guinness had made a transparent attempt tobelittle his services, the PA reported.    "I wish to emphasise that the fee paid for my services was,when considered out of context, admittedly very large."    But every aspect of the (Distillers) bid - the size of thetarget, the benefit to Guinness from success, the potentialdamage from failure, the difficulties of the issues raised andthe cost for all services - were not merely large but virtuallyunprecedented in the history of English takeovers," Ward said.    Failure would have cost Guinness between 25 mln stg and 100mln stg, he added.    Ward said it was his idea to have a merger agreement withDistillers under which Distillers agreed to pay Guinness's bidcosts, the PA reported.    Ward's statement was read to the court by his lawyer PeterCurry. Ward and ex-Guinness chairman Saunders want to end atemporary court freeze of their assets up to the disputedamount of the 5.2 mln stg fee which Guinness is trying torecover.    Guinness acquired Distillers in a fierecly fought 2.7billion stg battle during 1986. The U.K. Government is alsoprobing the affair and has yet to report. Reuter&#3;
reut2-015.sgm, MEMBERS OF JAPAN'S RULING PARTY SHUN NAKASONE, Members of prime minister YasuhiroNakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have shunnedhis support in their campaigns for upcoming local elections.    "His presence will do more harm than good," an LDP candidatein Tokyo told Reuters. The candidate is one of severalconservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcryagainst Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax.    Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step downbefore the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10if the LDP lost too many major local seats.    Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led hisparty to its greatest-ever election victory last July, andanalysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline.    Over 2,500 local seats will be filled during two rounds ofpolling. The first round is on Sunday, the second on April 26.    Political analysts said a seat to watch would be thegovernorship of Fukuoka, southern Japan. The LDP and two centreparties are challenging the incumbent governor, Hachiji Okuda,who is supported by the opposition socialist and communistparties.    The proposed tax is a key campaign issue.    "The LDP and the centrist parties should have about1,350,000 votes against 700,000 for Okuda. But Okuda is theincumbent and has the sales tax weapon," said Rei Shiratori,professor of political science at Dokkyo University.    "Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October ifthe LDP wins in Fukuoka," he said.    Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win thegovernorship of the northern island of Hokkaido.    But Kenzo Uchida, professor of political science at HoseiUniversity, said, "Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough ifthe LDP loses only in Hokkaido."    The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the salestax proposal.    The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan tooverhaul the tax system, which has remained unchanged for 36years.    It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanesedomestic demand and cut back on exports. Without the taxrevenue the government would have less to spend on stimulatingthe economy. REUTER&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY, Zimbabwe's beef exports to the EuropeanCommunity (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs thisyear, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouthdisease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.    The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to theEC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the ECveterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.    The outbreak in the country's main ranching province hasalready led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia tobar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairyindustry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in exportrevenue.    "The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normallywhen an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension ofbeef exports," one industry source said yesterday.     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, "Depending on theseriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee thendecides on three options, allowing us to continue exportingbeef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspensionon exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We arestill awaiting their decision," he added, asking not to beidentified.    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes ofhigh-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country hadspent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences andupgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will beforced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at lowprices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef salescould fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said. Reuter&#3;

The issue is unique in several respects and is only one ofa handful of such deals to be brought to this market, he said.    Unlike most eurobonds, the issue will not be underwritten.Instead, IRT mandated Chandler Partnership to find potentialinvestors with whom the issue can be preplaced and to thenplace on a "best efforts" basis what ever amount may not besubscribed.    Chandler itself was set up in the Isle of Jersey in themiddle of last year as a partnership, whose members have beeninvolved in financial markets.    The deal has two sponsors who assist in the placement--Interallianz Bank Zurich AG and Nivison Cantrade Ltd, a smallU.K. Trading firm that formerly was broker R. Nivison and Co.    The debentures are due June 1, 2002 and pay a semi-annualcoupon of two pct and are priced at par. They can be convertedinto shares of the company's stock at 23-1/2 dlrs a share.    IRT's shares closed last night on the New York StockExchange at 19-7/8.    The debentures can be redeemed at par at maturity and arecallable at the company's option after the first two years.    On or after August 1989 the company can call half thedebentures if the stock trades for 30 days at 123 pct of theconversion price and half if it reaches 140 pct of theconversion price, Nivison said.    In addition, holders will be able to surrender half thebonds during May 1991 at 123 pct for a semi-annual yield of7.043 pct and the other half in May 1993 at 140 pct, for ayield of 7.383 pct.    The payment date is June 1, 1987. The debentures will belisted in London and the fees for the deal total 2-1/4 pct.    Nivison said that the deal contains a convenent whichstates that if the company's debt to equity ratio exceeds twoto one the debentures cannot be converted unless the companyobtains a bank guarantee or a letter of credit.    Nivison said IRT's debt to equity ratio currently is lessthan one to one.

reut2-015.sgm, HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE, The House Armed Services Committeehas voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiledmaterials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity andquality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Billwhich will be voted on in the House next month.    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committeeyesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discouragesell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, astaff member of the committee told Reuters.    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by beingmanaged properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpileover the last 10 years has been atrocious."    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to aWhite House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.    The staffer said under the measures passed by the committeethe Secretary of Defense would have more influence overdecisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrsworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. Thestockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to managethe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budgetand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpilemanagement was counter-productive, he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY, Canada's trade picture has brightenedconsiderably, underscoring economists' predictions the sectorwould post a long awaited recovery this year.    The federal government reported today that the monthlysurplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher thanFebruary 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.    "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said RichardsonGreenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.    Economists generally don't expect such large gains over thenext months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout theyear.    "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over theyear, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure isindicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at theToronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billiondls in the month.    "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value ofexports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in itsmonthly report.    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billiondlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would endup three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billiondlrs.    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touchedoff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning afterclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in earlyafternoon trading.    Economists have been banking on an improved tradeperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggishCanadian economy.    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touchedoff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning afterclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in earlyafternoon trading.    Economists have been banking on an improved tradeperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggishCanadian economy.    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending ata torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlaysthis year and this should help curtail the flow of imports intothe country.    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the UnitedStates, by far the country's largest market, is expected to bestrong as a result of a projected rise in American consumerspending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.    "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's exportperformance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland'sDonegan.    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economistWarren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook andsaid it could be a mistake to read too much into February'strade upturn.    Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showingsigns of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicatethat part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) isprobably transitory."

reut2-015.sgm, HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE, The House Armed Services Committeehas voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiledmaterials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity andquality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Billwhich will be voted on in the House next month.    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committeeyesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discouragesell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, astaff member of the committee told Reuters.    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by beingmanaged properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpileover the last 10 years has been atrocious."    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to aWhite House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.    The staffer said that under the measures passed by thecommittee the Secretary of Defense would have more influenceover decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrsworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. Thestockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to managethe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budgetand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpilemanagement was counter-productive, he said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-015.sgm, MIYAZAWA WARNS ABOUT CURRENCY SHIFTS, Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa said that further substantial exchange rate shiftscould damage the prospects for growth and adjustment and calledfor cooperation in exchange markets.    In a statement to the International Monetary Funds InterimCommittee, Miyazawa said it was imperative that current accountsurplus countries follow policies designed to strengthendomestic demand and reduce surpluses while maintaining pricestability. He said Japan intended to carry out policiesannounced at the Paris meeting of finance ministers tostimulate its economy.    Miyazawa said that, given the massive external imbalancesand serious unemployment in some countries, "there are very realfears of a protectionist uprising."    In addition, "we are most concerned about this very seriousproblem of exchange rate instability," Miyazawa said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA, The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the SovietUnion to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, theUSDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated becauseSoviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the lastmonth.    USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,USDA said.    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnesmiscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop sufferedthrough a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.    The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in aboveaverage winter-kill," USDA said.    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter lossesmaybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buyinggrain recently.    USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnesgrain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheatand 12 mln tonnes coarse grain. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL, The United States' dependency onforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Associates.    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977.    "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990.    "However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction," Lichtblau said.    He said that one of the government's negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration.    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.    "An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.    Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.    A potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the StrategicPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy.

reut2-015.sgm, ARGENTINA WARNS IT MAY CUT OFF TALKS WITH BANKS, Argentina's Economy Minister JuanSourrouille said the "narrow interest" of creditor banks washolding up an accord to stretch out debt repayments and warnedArgentina may break off negotiations.    "It is inadmissible that the private narrow interest of somebanks threatens to turn into an insurmountable obstacle for apolicy we have agreed with the international community,"Sourrouille said.    Speaking to the International Monetary Fund's InterimCommittee meeting, Sourrouille said Argentina had given ampleproof that it is negotiating seriously with the banks.    "Today, with that same responsibility, we are clearlystating that it will be imposible for us to continuenegotiating on that basis."    A monetary source who heard Sourrouille's speech from avantage point close to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker,said Baker turned to one of his advisors to ask for the namesof banks that Sourrouille said were stalling on an agreement.    "Let's give them a call right away," the source quoted Bakeras saying.    Sourrouille reminded the Interim Committee that the IMFlast February approved a 1.3-billion-dlr stand-by loan and alonger-term credit, known as an extended Fund Facility foranother 500,000 dlrs.    But he said that despite Argentina's "disciplined effort" toachieve inflation-free economic growth, it was unable to obtainIMF payouts due to the link between that arrangement andsettlement of a separate agreement with creditor banks.    Sourrouille  stated flatly that the banks were flouting along-established practice under which debtor countries whichreached agreements on economic reforms with the Fund were agood credit risk for the banks.    "In other words, facts are demonstrating that the currentdebt strategy is showing that an IMF agreement is only a weaksignal for the beginning of another discussion (with thebanks)," he stated.    He added the fact that the strategy is not working was alsodemonstrated when governments that approved Argentina's programhad to join in a bridge loan for his country.    Sourrouille stated that Argentina has met IMF requirementsregarding its balance of payments and its monetary and fiscalpolicies.    Despite this Sourrouille said, "What we are facing is theinexplicable demands (from the banks) that are blockingnegotations."    Argentina, with a foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs, has beenseeking to reschdule 24 billion dlrs in "old debt" and another4.2 billion dlrs that had been refinanced in 1985.    The minister also said there were two issues separatingArgentina from an accord with creditor banks, one was a minimumdifference on the interest rate margin above internationallevels.    The other condition, of more concern, were suggestions bythe banks that would upset the country's financial system.    Monetary sources said creditor banks have been offeringArgentina the London Interbank rate (Libor) plus 7/8 pct, whichthey gave Venezuela in a recent refinancing agreement.    The sources said Argentina is committed to winning thelower spread Mexico gained last year of 13/16 pct above Libor. Reuter&#3;

reut2-015.sgm, AMR (AMR) TO START INFORMATION CAMPAIGN IN DISPUTE, AMR Corp's American Airlines will startits own information campaign in its dispute with theAssociation of Professional Flight Attendants.    The company, which has been negotiating with its 10,000attendants since late last year, will give out informationbrochures at its terminals, outlining its position, accordingto L.C. Duncan Jr., vice president of corporate communications.    During a news conference, Duncan said the APFA wasconducting a "smear campaign" by handing out leaflets at thecompany's terminals. The union says it was trying to win publicsupport by presenting its position.     Last month, American fired 20 flight attendants forhanding out the leaflets at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. Theunion is fighting the move in court.     In response to a question, Duncan said the company'slatest proposal for a new three-year contract, which wasoffered March 11, does away with a two-tiered system of pay,whereby new employees are paid on a lower scale than thosehired before 1983.     However, the union has contended that the company'sproposal keeps the system in a disguised form.     A union spoksewoman had no immediate response toAmerican's announcement.     Currently, the airline and the union are in the middle ofa federally-mandated 30-day cooling off period that wastriggered after both sides rejected a federal mediator's offerof binding arbitration.
