reut2-017.sgm, SORO GROUP TO LIMIT FAIRCHILD &lt;FEN> STOCK BUYS, Quantum Fund N.V., a NetherlandsAntilles mutual fund for which New York investor George Sorosis investment adviser, said it has agreed to limit furtherpurchases of Fairchild Industries Inc stock.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Quantum, which already holds 1,647,481 Fairchild common shares,or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding, said it agreed to therestriction after Fairchild said its security clearance mightbe jeopardized if Quantum acquires a major stake in it.    But Quantum said Fairchild management was told that Soros,acting either individually or through entities other thanQuantum that he controls, may decide to buy common stock in thecompany on his own behalf.    Quantum had recently notified the Federal Trade Commissionunder the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild's voting stock.Unless the FTC had objected, Quantum would have been free, butnot obligated, to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild stock.    Fairchild management, however, warned that if Quantum, aforeign entity, raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct, itcould "impair" the government security clearances Fairchildneeds to carry out its its defense contract work.    In response, Quantum said it told Fairchild it will notmake "significant additional purchases" of its common orpreferred stock without giving Fairchild enough prior notice toenable it to consult with Quantum over the impact of action.    Quantum also said it has withdrawn its notification requestto the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Departmentof its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild.    Quantum also said it told the FTC and the JusticeDepartment that it does not expect to resubmit any furthernotifications of intent to significantly raise its stake inFairchild at this time.

reut2-017.sgm, CREATIVE MONETARY POLICY TO SPUR KUWAITI ECONOMY, Kuwait, a major oil producer hit by lastyear's price slump, is leaning towards a more creative monetarypolicy to help spur its economy, banking sources said.    "There is a clear emphasis on encouraging the use of moneyin productive ventures, rather than having it all tied up ininterest bearing investments which have no direct productiveoutlet," one banker said.    Kuwait's Central Bank yesterday cut one key money marketrate and abandoned another which had been used since February1986 to direct inter-bank borrowing and lending costs.    The bank reduced to six pct from 6-1/2 pct the rate atwhich it will offer funds of one month to one year in theinter-bank market. This, in turn, affected retail rates.    The cut, the third this year, followed a major overhaul ofinterest rate policy last month which Central Bank GovernorSheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah said was designed to revivethe economy.    One banker said "There is growing flexibility, creativity,in interest rate policy, amid an awareness of the need todiversify the economy by stimulating the non-oil sector."    For the first time in nearly three years domestic interestrates are now significantly below those for the U.S. Dollar, afavourite haven for Gulf speculative and investor funds in thepast, banking sources said.    Despite uncertainties generated by the 6-1/2 year old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's northern doorstep, bankers play down theprospect of any significant capital flight.    The Kuwaiti dinar, whose value is set by the Central Bankand was fixed today at 0.27095/129 to the dollar, is strongernow than for several years.    Fears that the dollar may fall further will prompt secondthoughts among Kuwaiti investors prepared to consider switchingfunds into the U.S. Currency, the sources said.    "There is a distinct exchange rate risk," they added.    Bankers said the dollar slump hurt many investors behindthe last major capital outflow in 1984, encouraged then by 18pct U.S. Interest rates and the start of Iranian attacks onneutral shipping in the Gulf.    The Central Bank calculates its dinar exchange rate againsta basket of currencies. Bankers do not know the basket's exactmake-up but say it is weighted heavily in favour of the dollar.    Some bankers believe any strengthening of the dinar beyond0.27000 to the dollar might provoke investors into shiftingfunds into the U.S. Currency. "They may ask:When will the dollarbe so cheap again?" one said.    And with dinar interest rates now roughly one pct belowthose for the dollar, they say the Central Bank faces adelicate balancing role requiring further flexibility.    Bankers said the current, expansionary interest rate policyis only part of a broader attempt to encourage local investmentand strengthen the backbone of the economy.    They estimate the economy, measured in terms of GDP andallowing for inflation, shrank 19 pct in 1986 after an 8.1 pctcontraction the previous year.    Bankers also noted recent measures to stimulate stockmarket activity, capped today by sharp cuts in brokerage feesto make it cheaper for investors to trade. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, SENATE PREPARING FOR NEW U.S. BUDGET BATTLE, Congress returned from its Easterrecess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promisesto be a partisan dispute.    The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reaganand Republicans is expected to get underway this week in theSenate late this week and last at least another week. It istaking on new prominence because of current trade woes.    That is because the budget problems and its associated hugedeficits are said to be at the root of related internationaltrade friction currently worrying financiers.    As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stockexchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the UnitedStates and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major tradewar between the two trading giants for the first time sinceWorld War II.    Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan isrefusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and theresulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisionsand small computers.    Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neitherside wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit.    Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up tothe economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue togrow without repercussions.    A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed byforeigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if theywithdraw this support the result can only be further problems,including higher interest rates for Americans.    In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to theshowdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollarspending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,was trounced badly in the House on April 9.    The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed theHouse, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, throughdefense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrsin new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take upits own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will bepassage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle.    In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan'sRepublicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the SenateBudget Committee for full Senate consideration.    A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters hebelieves this very unusual unanimous opposition was by designamong congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacitapproval of the White House.    "Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any taxhikes and defense cuts," he said.    In the coming weeks, the source said, Democrats will pressfor a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget withReagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But "it is notclear how the Republicans will act," he added.    He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lowertaxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer afterReagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House.     When Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he inheritedwhat was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that woundup to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year.    Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983,critics note that his administration's record of accumulateddebt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or 1,100 billiondlrs.    That is money the government must borrow, and pay back, andmany analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and causedthe worst U.S. trade deficit ever.     Last year the United States bought goods from the worldworth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold, includingpurchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods.    While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on onefront through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatorymeasures unless all markets are opened, its success so faragainst the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress.    Congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put thedeficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30.    Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget lawenacted in late 1985, there has been pressure on Congress to domore than talk about deficits.    That law, named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm ofTexas, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat ErnestHollings of South Carolina, calls for a balanced budget by 1991through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet.    The law has been followed, even though an enforcementmechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts ifCongress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court.    The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. Butin reality, the goal has actually been missed. For example,Congress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 targetof a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving thenumbers, the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billiondlrs -- far off the target.    This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal isexpected to be missed widely. Reuter&#3;

De la Dehesa said the March rise, announced today by theNational Statistics Institute, was not entirely satisfactorybut acceptable.    The year on year rate at the end of February was six pct.Prices rose 8.3 pct last year.    The March rise included a 0.05 pct increase correcting anerror in last January's consumer price index. Economists hadearlier said the error could have been as high as 0.2 pct.    De la Dehesa said seasonal increases in food prices pushedthe index up in March and he expected the rate to be lower inApril.    The Communist-led Workers Commissions union said the Marchprice rise showed inflation was going up again and thegovernment looked increasingly unlikely to meet its five pcttarget.    The Workers Commissions said the inflation trend fuelledunions's claims to wage increases beyond the government'srecomendation to limit wage rises at around five pct.

reut2-017.sgm, FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY, U.S. banking data released today aretoo distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetarypolicy, but they do support the market's assumption that theFederal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,economists said.    "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discountwindow borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rateaverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistentwith a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First ChicagoCorp.    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate thatthe Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-weekstatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week ofDecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billiondlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total thisyear - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at theFed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more inreserves than the Fed had anticipated.    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fedis aiming for much lower discount window borrowings thanwitnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may haveforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the weekended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of theproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions topay annual income taxes.    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do thereserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billiondlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economistssaid the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of theprojected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started toadd reserves too late.    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparentlyleft Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with whichto enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economistssaid. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of reposoutstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to addeven more reserves but was prevented from doing so.    "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add asmuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targettingdiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has nottightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of thestatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced thatthe Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today'sfigures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be movingtoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rateunless the dollar's fall gathers pace.    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing politicalopposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a timewhen Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key toreducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

reut2-017.sgm, JAPANESE PARLIAMENT PASSES 1987 BUDGET, Parliament's Lower House passed the 1987budget shortly before midnight local time, officialparliamentary sources said.    The move followed agreement by the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party to a proposal that could kill its plan tointroduce a controversial sales tax, political analysts said.The move was seen as a major blow to Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone, the leading advocate of the five pct tax, they said.    Some analysts said Nakasone may be forced to step downafter the June summit of heads of major industrial democraciesand before his one-year term is due to expire at end-October.    Under the compromise agreed by the LDP and oppositionparties, Lower House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara will take charge ofthe sales tax bill, appoint a ruling/opposition party councilto debate it and allow opposition leaders to review the presenttax system, analysts said.    Hara also verbally agreed to scrap the sales tax planentirely if the joint council fails to reach agreement on howto handle the tax.    The opposition parties, who have been vociferouslyattacking the sales tax plan for months, hailed the decision asa great victory.    The opposition parties had already delayed passage of thebudget for three weeks after the April 1 start of the fiscalyear by intermittent parliamentary boycotts.    Although the LDP had more than enough votes to ram thebudget through parliament, it had been reluctant to do so forfear of a backlash of public opinion, especially after itssetback in recent local elections due to the sales tax issue.    The ruling party though was anxious to pass the budgetbefore Nakasone leaves next week for the U.S. So that he couldtell Washington the Japanese government was doing its utmost toboost the sagging economy and imports.    According to Kyodo News Service, Nakasone told reporters hedid not think the sales tax was dead.    If the sales tax is dropped, it could prove a major boostto the economy because it would increase the government budgetdeficit, economists said.    The sales tax was originally scheduled to be introducednext January to help offset the loss of government revenuesstemming from a cut in income and corporate taxes due to gointo effect this month.

The government must take adequate economic measures toexpand domestic demand and stabilise exchange rates in a bid toensure sustained econonic growth, the report said.    The report made a special reference to the yen's renewedrise and its effect on the economy, the officials said, addingthe agency's judgement of current economic conditions has notchanged since last month.

reut2-017.sgm, NAKASONE EXPECTED TO SURVIVE SALES TAX DEFEAT, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone'sunpopular sales tax plan has been defeated and although fellowpoliticians and political analysts agree he has suffered agrave loss of face only a few are willing to write him off.    Michio Watanabe, a Nakasone faction member and deputysecretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, LDP,is one of those who believes he will survive.    "He's tough, he won't step down," but "will hang on to thedeath" at least until his term ends on October 30, Watanabe toldReuters.    The sales tax scheme was a mainstay in Nakasone's plans torevamp the nation's tax system for the first time in 36 years.Watanabe acknowledged that the five pct sales tax was amistake.    "It was too greedy," he said. A two or three pct tariff mighthave been easier to swallow, he said.    One popular school of thought among skeptical analysts isthat Nakasone will be remain in office at least until the June8-10 summit of industrialised nations in Venice.    A Western diplomatic observer said he believed thatNakasone would be at the summit as prime minister. But he wouldnot bet on his chances of survival up until October.    Masamichi Inoki, a senior fellow at the conservativeInstitute of Peace and Security, said he did not think Nakasonehad suffered irreparable damage.    "He will certainly hang on for the summit," Inoki said.    In any event, the general belief now is that the five pctsales tax, as championed by Nakasone, is a dead issue but thatan indirect tax, in another form, will be introduced by theLDP.    Inoki said he believed the issue would be resurrected asearly as the next Diet (parliament) meets. The current sessionfinishes on May 27.    The newspaper Tokyo Shimbun expressed another stream ofopinion, stating that Nakasone might well get another year todeal with the unfinished and unpopular business of tax reform.    The government has to find a way of generating revenue tosupport an expected glut of elderly Japanese.    And the only means of drumming up the money is to levy anindirect tax, said Watanabe, a former Minister of InternationalTrade and Industry.    The next prime minister will have to grapple with anindirect tax, and "whoever is the next prime minister won't bein the job very long," Watanabe said.    Watanabe said he doubted the next prime minister would beany of the three so-called "New Leaders," LDP secretary generalNoboru Takeshita, LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe,and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Each of them controls apowerful LDP faction. "It will be somebody else," he said.    Political science professor Rei Shiratori of DokkyoUniversity gave one of the darkest readings on Nakasone'spolitical future.    "Soon after the Venice summit, there will be a move tochange the government by the New Leaders," Shiratori said.    "He can't fight on," he said.    He said Nakasone had a special emotional attachment to thesales tax plan as the last and most important item in Japan'spurge of policies inherited from the U.S. Occupation.    Shiratori said an indirect tax will have to be levied, but"to introduce such a tax, they'll have to change the primeminister."    Nevertheless, Shiratori said he believes Nakasone couldhang on until as late as September. REUTER&#3;

Charles Chen told Reuters the original three year accordhas been extended by one year to the end of 1989. The U.S. Hasagreed to raise the limit on annual growth of Taiwan's textileand apparel exports to one pct from 0.5 pct for calendar 1989,he said. "The new accord is more fair and gives breathing spaceto our textile makers (so they can) diversify their exports toother nations," he added.    Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similartextile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. Butdespite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivalsin Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwandollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct againstthe U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won roseby some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable.    Taiwan's textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8billion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the samethis year, Chen said.

The plan calls for additional fiscal measures worth morethan 5,000 billion yen, a large-scale supplementary budget forthe current fiscal year started April 1, and concentration ofmore than 80 pct of the annual public works budget in the firsthalf of the year, they said.    Nakasone will explain the measures to U.S. Officials duringhis visit to Washington starting April 29.    The LDP plan will be the basis for a government package ofpump-priming measures expected to be unveiled in late May.    The LDP said Japan should do more to reduce its tradesurplus. Its plan is expected to help increase economic growthled by domestic demand, officials said.    The government was also urged to review the ceiling onbudgetary requests for investment purposes in 1988/89. Thegovernment has imposed a five pct cut in investment outlays inthe past five years in line with Nakasone's avowed policy offiscal reforms.    The plan called on Japan to promote government purchases offoreign goods and private sector imports of manufactured goodsby improving import financing, and to make clear officialprocurement procedures for foreign supercomputers.    The LDP also said Japan should contribute further tosociety at large through measures such as doubling its officialdevelopment assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs in five years or soinstead of seven years as the government had originallypromised.    The government was urged to work out a program to recyclefunds from Japan's trade surpluses to debt-ridden countries.

Oil products earnings were 38 mln dlrs, up 19 mln dlrs fromlast year, when margins were impaired by lower oil prices.    Shell Canada said chemical earnings were 17 mln dlrs in thequarter, compared with a loss of five mln dlrs in 1986. Thestyrene business saw significant improvement, stemming from anincrease in international demand.    Resources earnings increased by six mln dlrs to 46 mlndlrs. Lower prices for all commodities were offset by theremoval of the Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax, the impact oflower royalty rates and higher volumes.    Gross production of crude oil and natural gas liquidsincreased seven pct from the first quarter of last year to11,200 cubic meters a day, Shell said.

reut2-017.sgm, U.S., JAPAN TRADE TIES REMAIN HOSTILE, The visit this week by a specialJapanese envoy has done little to defuse Japan's tradefrictions with the United States, U.S. and congressionalleaders say.    White House and congressional leaders took a wait-and-seestance, after a series of meetings with former Japanese ForeignMinister Shintaro Abe, who was here paving the way for theApril 29-May 2 visit of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.    They are withholding judgment until Nakasone's visit, withone senator saying Japan had promised to stimulate its economyand open its markets to foreign goods in the past, but it wastime now for action.    The U.S. trade deficit last year was a record 169.8 billiondlrs, with more than one-third of it in trade with Japan.    Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to tryto turn around the deficit, which has cost millions of U.S.jobs and closed thousands of factories.    Much of the anger has been directed at Japan.    U.S.-Japan trade friction was further fueled by PresidentReagan's April 17 decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mlndlrs worth of Japanese goods in retaliation for unfairpractices in semiconductor trade.    Reagan said he imposed the tariffs on personal computers,television sets and hand tools because Japan failed to keep anagreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets atless than cost and to open its home market to U.S. products.     Abe had asked Reagan to end the tariffs quickly, but U.S.officials said the curbs would not be dropped until Japan hadshown it was honoring the pact, which could take severalmonths.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if Nakasone'svisit might help to defuse trade tensions, said "whetherprogress can be made depends on how you want to measure it."    He added, "I would expect progress to be made. If you wantto measure that in terms of lifting the sanctions, that's moredoubtful."    Congressmen were equally skeptical.    Abe met Senate and Democratic leaders active in tradelegislation, telling them of Japan's plan to spur domesticspending by 34 billion dlrs and open its markets to a widerange of goods, including supercomputers and farm products.    Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, said after themeeting, "We have heard promises in the past, but the questionnow is whether there will be real action."    Abe also met House leaders pressing for a tough trade bill,including Congressman Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat.    Gephardt is sponsoring legislation to penalize nations withlarge deficits and which are guilty of unfair trade practices.    Gephardt's legislation would hit Japan, as well as Taiwan,South Korea, and West Germany. The bill is expected to pass theHouse next week - coinciding with Nakasone's visit - but itsfate in the more moderate Senate is uncertain. A bipartisangroup of senators, however, told Nakasone in a letter releasedas Abe was holding Senate meetings, that fresh Japanese-U.S.trade strife would erupt if Japan's markets were not soonopened to American goods.    The signers included Democratic leader Robert Byrd of WestVirginia, Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas and othersranging from moderate to hardline on trade issues.    They said in the letter there was growing U.S. sentimentthat Japan was fighting opening its markets and "evidence to thecontrary is necessary to combat this perception, or it islikley that additional efforts will be attempted to close offthe American market to Japanese goods.

It blamed the expected slowdown partly on a disappointingoutlook for exports caused by the weaker dollar. Exports wouldlikely grow by 2.8 pct this year and by 3.0 pct in 1988, after3.0 pct in 1986, the group predicted.    Final domestic demand will also fall back, to a likely 3.0pct this year and 2.3 pct next, after 4.1 pct in 1986. However,the domestic picture will likely be mixed.    The study said investment in plant and equipment wouldcontinue to be the main motor for the growth in domesticdemand, although it was unlikely to grow as fast as last year's7.4 pct, rising this year by 4.5 pct and by 2.8 pct in 1988.    While the growth in private consumption is expected to fallback to 2.5 pct this year and 2.1 pct in 1988 from last year's3.1 pct, public consumption spending will likely grow by 1.9pct in 1987 and 2.0 pct next year, after 1.5 pct in 1986.

The company said profits in the lastest quarter included a26 mln drl restructuring gain from divestment of certain goldoperations overseas, while last year's first quarter profit of1.71 billion dlrs included the initial charge of 235 mln dlrsfor its 1986 corporate reorganization.    First quarter revenues were down 13 pct to 19.44 billiondlrs.       One time items aside, Exxon said, its first quarter resultswere stronger than 1986's final quarter which included severallarge asset sales and positive inventory adjustments.    It said earnings per share declined 36 pct reflecting thecompany's continued purchases of its own common for thetreasury. During the first quarter, 5,085,000 shares wereacquired at a cost of 416 mln dlrs compared with 3,132,000 in1986's fourth quarter.    Commenting on the first quarter, Exxon said crude oilprices strengthened moderately within the quarter and werehigher than a year ago at the end of the quarter.       However, average crude prices for the quarter were belowthe year ago period, leading to lower earnings for explorationand production operations, Exxon said.    Also contributing to reduced earnings were lower naturalgas prices, primarily overseas, representing contractadjustments representing contract adjustments tied to fallingproduct prices in 1986, the company said.    During the first quarter, the company said, intensecompetition in both domestic and international markets servedto depress margins for refined products.       Exxon said the lower product margins resulted insignificantly reduced earnings for refining and marketingoperations, contrasting sharply with the unusually strongmargins prevailing in the first qtr of 1986.    It said savings from efforts to control costs and improveefficiency helped soften the negative impact of lower oil andnatural gas prices.    Exxon said earnings from chemicals and power generationactivities showed consideratble improvement, remaining strongthroughout the period. Reuter&#3;

The state owned banking group says although Zimbabwe'sbalance of payments improved significantly last year theunderlying position deteriorated. Last year's improved tradesurplus was partly the result of sales of stockpiled gold andcontinued import restraint.    It says debt service charges are projected to exceed 35 pctof exports in 1987 and warns against squeezing imports further.    ZBC says mining industry import quotas for the first sixmonths of 1987 have been halved and those for manufacturingindustry cut by a third.    It contrasts the performance of manufacturing industry in1967 to 1974, with that since independence in 1980. Industrialproduction almost doubled between 1967 and 1974, when foreigncurrency allocations almost trebled in real terms.    Since 1980, import allocations have been cut 45 pct and theZimbabwe dollar has depreciated by more than 60 pct. As aresult the bank says the external purchasing power of foreigncurrency allocations is currently only 20 pct of its 1980levels. REUTER&#3;

"They are deliberately keeping prices down to help meet thisyear's inflation target despite the threat of a surplus on whatlooks like a bigger harvest than we expected," he said.    He said the policy of allowing stocks to accumulate hadcaused a price drop, with raw oil prices falling to 147 pesetasa kilo from 160 at the start of the 1986/87 marketing yearending July 31.    Sunflower oil output was expected to rise to 370,000 tonnesthis year from 340,000 last year, with seed output up at905,000 tonnes from 860,000 last year.    He said domestic consumption was falling due to imports ofother edible oils. "We estimate demand at 296,000 tonnes thisyear, leaving a 124,000 tonne surplus with the 50,000 tonnesnow stockpiled," he said. "If we discount 24,000 tonnes held forstrategic purposes, this still leaves us with 100,000 tonnes." Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, SHELL OIL FIRST QUARTER NET DROPS 61 PCT , Shell Oil Co said first quarter netincome dropped 61 pct over the prior-year quarter on revenuesthat slipped four pct.    "Lower prices for crude oil and natural gas and reducedmargins in our oil and chemical products businesses were themajor factor for the earings decline," John F. Bookout,president, said in a statement.    For the quarter, the company, a unit of Royal Dutch/ShellGroup &lt;RD> &lt;SC>, earned 108 mln dlrs on sales of 4.50 billiondlrs, compared with 276 mln dlrs on sales of 4.67 billion dlrsa year ago.    Bookout said the company is cautiously optimistic oilmarkets will be less volatile in coming months than they werein 1986.    "In coming months, oil products results should benefit fromseasonally higher gasoline volumes," he said.    "However, so long as U.S. product inventories remain high,it may be difficult to fully recover from the depressed marginsof recent periods," he added.    Bookout said the company's chemical products earningsshould benefit from strong performances in chemical salesvolumes and continued high industry operating rates.    Shell said its oil and gas exploration and product segmentearned 110 mln dlrs for the quarter vs 91 mln dlrs in 1986.    It said earnings were hurt by lower selling prices forcrude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Domestic crudeoil prices averaged 14.24 dlrs a barrel, compared with 19.28dlrs last year, while natural gas prices dropped 24 pct, Shellsaid.    Shell said earnings at its oil products segment plunged by53 mln dlrs, to eight mln dlrs. It said lower refined productselling prices were only partially offset by reduced rawmaterial costs.    The company said earnings from chemical products also fellsharply, to 40 mln dlrs from 72 mln dlrs, due mainly to lowermargins, especially in commodity chemicals, coupled with itspullout from the agricultural chemicals business in October1986.    Shell said capital and exploratory outlays totaled 500 mlndlrs for the quarter, off from 645 mln dlrs. Reuter&#3;

But the chairman of the bank employers' federation, HorstBurgard, told reporters in Frankfurt he hoped the two sideswould reach agreement after a pause for thought.    DAG chief negotiator Gerhard Renner said the employers'offer to resume talks was farcical as long as they refused toremove the issue of flexible working hours from the talks.    Both sides agreed there was now little point in top levelnegotiations similar to those held in the engineering industrywhich resolved a dispute on working hours.    Renner and HBV chief negotiator Lorenz Schwegler said theywere prepared to compromise on the issue of flexible workinghours, but this subject should not be included in the wagenegotiations for the 380,000 bank employees.    Burgard, also management board member of Deutsche Bank AG,said the employers sought acceptance of more flexible hours onan unchanged 40 hour week in the negotiations.    The employers have unilaterally imposed a 3.6 pct pay risebackdated to March 1, with the collapse of the talks. The HBVis seeking a six pct rise and DAG a 6.5 pct increase.    Schwegler said the unions would react to the collapse ofthe talks with protest and warning strikes. Union officialswould resist overtime and attempts to introduce flexible hours.

reut2-017.sgm, GERMAN INTERVENTION SUGAR FOR EXPORT - LDN TRADE, The most likely reason for West Germanproducers withdrawing white sugar from intervention stores isthat they already have, or are reasonably certain of, obtainingEuropean Community (EC) export licences for it, traders said.    They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brusselssaying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79,250tonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1.    The traders said it is also likely that French producers,who put over 700,000 tonnes into intervention, will withdraw asignificant proportion of this for the same reason before theyare due to accept payment for the sugar in early May.    Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the levelof export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders,with generous subsidies, had been due to producer threats toleave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most ofthe old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May.    The EC has so far granted licences for 2,467,970 tonnes outof around 3.1 mln tonnes targetted for export in the 1986/87series of tenders. This would indicate the likelihood of hightonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders andsubsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bidsfor the export licences, traders said.

reut2-017.sgm, UGANDAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSES NEW TAXES, The Ugandan government, in its fouryear investment and development plan, proposed taxing land andfood crops in an attempt to broaden its revenue base away fromdependence on coffee sales.    The government also said in the plan, made available toReuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would dolittle to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit.    The plan, the first since President Yoweri Museveni tookpower 15 months ago, seeks to raise 2.4 billion dlrs ininvestment funds from abroad between 1987 and 1991.    It says the government had already secured 1.4 billion dlrsin pledges before Islamic lenders promised a further 494 mlndlrs at a conference in Kampala last week.    Uganda already had an external debt of 984 mln dlrs at theend of 1986 and in the nine months of the current budget debtservicing will cost 204 mln dlrs, almost 50 pct of exportearnings of 431 mln, the plan said.    The new fiscal measures include a proposed tax on largeland holdings, regardless of whether the owners are exploitingthem, and taxes on maize, beans and other crops sold by theProduce Marketing Board.    The plan says the aim is to spread the tax burden, which inUganda has traditionally fallen almost exclusively on coffeefarmers. Coffee provides over 90 pct of foreign exchangeearnings and more than 70 pct of government revenue.    On exchange rate policy, it repeats Museveni's argumentthat any form of fotation would not help allocating resources.    Western governments and multilateral funds say the Ugandanshilling is grossly overvalued and the government must changethe exchange rate if it wishes to encourage investment. Theshilling sells on the black market at more than 15,000 to thedollar, compared with an official rate of 1,400. REUTER&#3;

"The M-1 surge will be very temporary. About two thirds ofthe increase is likely to be washed out in the following week,"said Kim Rupert, an economist at Money Market Services Inc.    Rupert said a huge increase in M-1 for the April 20 week isimplied by very strong deposit survey data and by anunexpectedly sharp gain in required reserves in Federal Reservedata released Thursday.    Those numbers, covering the two-week bank statement periodthat ended on April 22, show a 2.5 billion dlr jump in basicrequired reserves. Economists said this largely reflected theparking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock marketsales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes.Fed seasonal adjustments do not adequately compensate for theseand other special factors.    Analysts noted that income tax refunds from the Treasuryalso appear to be coming earlier than usual.    They also are not adequately compensated for by the Fed'sseasonal adjustment factors to the money supply.    The Federal Reserve is no longer targeting M-1 because thelink between M-1 and economic growth has largely been severedby financial market innovation and deregulation.    As such, there is likely to be little financial marketreaction to the huge M-1 increase that is expected to beannounced next week. Reuter&#3;

But, they said, logic and their own research do notsupport the rumors.    "Apparently a rumor is floating around trading circlesabout the Japanese doing something about tariffs on wood andpaper products," Lowell Moholt, director of investor relationsat Weyerhaeuser Co said. "And we can only assume that thisrumor is one of the factors hurting the stocks."    "I have talked to many people, some with governmentcontacts, and most of them have been mystified by the rumor,"said Moholt.

"My sources told me there is no grain of truth to theJapanese imposing tariffs," Sherman Chao, analyst with SalomonInc said. "The realities and the logic do not support theserumors," he said.    "The Japanese have a lot more to lose by imposing tariffs.They are running a trade surplus," he said, "and if theystarted a trade war it would hurt them more than the U.S."    Chao said that U.S. producers annually export about twobillion dlrs of forest products to Japan. "Three quarters ofthat is in the form of wood products, meaning logs, wood chipsand lumber, and the balance is paper products."    "They (the Japanese) don't have any domestic sources tomake up for the restrictions," Chao said, "so it's not likethey would put a tariff to protect their own industry."    "The rumors do no make economic sense, and I am skeptical,"analyst Mark Rogers of Prudential Bache Securities said, "butpolitics has been known to override economic concerns."     Speculation has surfaced on Wall Street recently that theJapanese would take action to retaliate against tariffs theReagan Administration imposed last Friday on Japaneseelectronics products.    Rogers said the rumor fueled the profit taking that wasalready occuring in these stocks.

Soviet industrial production from January to March grew by2.5 per cent compared with the same period last year, but fellshort of its target by 0.8 percent, official statistics showed.    "The Council of Ministers (government) emphasised that theresults did not meet the Communist Party's exacting demands forthe radical reconstruction of the economy," Tass said. "The firstquarter economic results were deemed unsatisfactory."    The government said poor economic results last January,when industrial production was 0.1 lower than in January 1986,had been overcome to a considerable extent in March, but thenegative effects had not been completely eliminated.     It singled out failings in the engineering, chemical andtimber industries, as well as light industry.    Growth in the machine-building sector, a priority inKremlin plans for economic renewal, also fell short of targetby 4.2 per cent, with below-level output in nearly all branchesat a cost of 723 million roubles (1.08 billion dollars) inundelivered products.    The sales volume of consumer goods fell 2.7 per cent shortof planned growth, with a resulting decline in income to thestate, the figures showed.

reut2-017.sgm, U.S. GASOLINE SURPLUS SEEN OVER NEAR TERM, Unless U.S. refiners reduce the amountof gasoline they now produce, the oil industry will enter thecoming summer driving season with the largest surplus of motorfuel since 1984, oil analysts and traders said.    "They key question is how much gasoline refiners produce inthe coming weeks," said Larry Goldstein of Petroleum IndustryResearch Inc. "If refiners cut output and demand turns upward,gasoline stocks could begin to draw, and the surplus couldpotentially turn around in four to eight weeks," saidGoldstein.    The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. gasoline stocksfor the week ended April 17 are 37.6 mln barrels above lastyear's levels, and analysts said they don't believe theexpected one to two pct rise in demand will take care of thesurplus before the start of the summer driving season, whichbegins Memorial Day weekend.    The API said the last time stocks were this high was in1984, when there was a 27 mln barrel excess. Oil traders saidthat the surplus held throughout the summer of 1984, depressingprices for the motor fuel.    Over the past several weeks, analysts said they expectedrefiners to reduce production because there was no profit incontinued production of gasoline due to the surplus. However,refineries continued to operate at higher levels, they said.    U.S. refineries have been running at about 78.8 pct ofcapacity during March and April this year, compared to 77.5 atthis time last year, API statistics show.    Because of the current excess in stocks, one planner for amajor oil company said he believed that most companies arecontemplating cutting refinery throughput over the near term.    He said some refiners appear to be selling lessaggressively in order to have product on hand to meet theexpected rise in demand this summer.    Goldstein said that other factors, such as higher speedlimits, the gasoline lead phasedown, and possible newrestrictions on gasoline vapor pressure could tighten thesupply situation this summer.    However, a planner at another major oil company said thatalthough large inventories are dampening the price outlook forgasoline this season, he does not expect refiners to cut outputsoon.    That oil company planner said high crude oil runs reducethe refiner's average costs, making the incremental barrel ofgasoline cheaper to produce.    Most analysts expect a slight upturn this summer over thesummer of 1986. Bo Poates, an analyst at the Energy FuturesGroup Inc said he foresees demand up about one pct in thesecond and third quarters of 1987.    Chase Econometrics' Scott Jones sees gasoline demand rising1.9 to 2.2 pct for the year, due mainly to continued lowprices. Reuter&#3;

June live cattle futures are called 0.20 to 0.50 cent loweron Monday and back months of cattle are expected 0.50 to 1.00cent lower. Pork bellies are expected 0.50 to 1.00 cent or morelower, the analysts said.    Disappointment was voiced over the placement and total onfeed figures in the cattle report. Both the quarterly sectionand monthly 7-state part showed the amount placed on feed andon feed numbers at the high end of expectations.    The other disappearance figure of only three pct above ayear ago in the 7-state section was also vieved as negative.Most of the early guesses predicted a much larger number fordeath loss following the two winter snow storms that struck thewest in late March, they said.    However, weight groupings were friendly to the nearbyfutures and should prompt some bull spreading on the decline,they said.    William Arndt from Dean Witter noted that the 900 to 1,100lb steers and 700 to 900 lb heifers were at 94 pct of a yearago and should lend some support to June futures. However, 700to 900 lb steers at 119 pct will weigh on August, he said.    "The big reduction in cattle weighing over 900 lbs shouldbe friendly to the market for at least the next 30 to 60 days,"AGE Clearing analyst Jerry Abbenhaus said.    Movement of bellies into frozen storage was at the high endof expectations and should weigh on futures tomorrow,especially as futures prices ended weak today, they said.    Other parts of the cold storage report were also viewed asnegative to livestock and meat futures.    "We have a lot of poultry in storage. Even though we havesmaller pork supplies, the decline is not enough to offset theincreases in poultry," Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levittsaid. Also, there is more beef in storage than last year andthis was achieved on smaller production. Reuter&#3;

Peru plans to produce 63 mln ounces of silver this year, andis the largest producer of the precious metal after Mexico.

reut2-017.sgm, OECD WARNS SWEDEN ON LABOUR COSTS, High labour costs and slower corporateinvestment could hinder Sweden's economic growth after 1987,the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development,OECD, said.    The Swedish economy grew at a slower rate in 1986 than inprevious years. GDP rose about 1.7 pct in 1986 compared with2.2 pct in 1985. But this growth depended largely on externalfactors, particularly lower oil prices, the OECD secretariatsaid in its latest annual report on Sweden.    It warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly inSweden than in other OECD countries.    Because of high labour costs Swedish industry, whichlargely relies upon export markets, was losing market share.Wages in the manufacturing sector grew by seven pct in 1986, inline with 1985 increases, while public sector wages rose anestimated 9.2 pct in 1986, up from six pct in 1985.    This was significantly higher than average wage increasesof 3.75 pct for the seven largest members of the OECD in 1986.    The report said wage moderation was central to maintainingeconomic growth in Sweden. It suggested that wage negotiationsshould be at least partly centralised to control the totalwages bill and hold down inflation and unemployment levels.    Helped by low oil prices and the government's tight fiscalpolicy, inflation fell to just over three pct in 1986 fromalmost six pct in 1985 but remained higher than in most otherOECD countries, the report said.    Unemployment, a principal policy target, was at 2.7 pct in1986, in line with 1985's 2.8 pct and well below the OECDaverage of 8.6 pct. The report said Sweden's employmentpolicies accounted for the high levels of wage inflation.    It also said that economic growth in 1986 reliedincreasingly on private consumption because corporateinvestment in machinery and equipment had shrunk.    The total volume of industrial investments dropped by twopct in 1986, with sharp declines in spending by the wood, pulpand paper industries. This compared to a 19 pct rise in 1985when there was heavy investment in these industries.    The OECD said Sweden should now make an effort to boostcorporate investments and reduce its dependence on domesticconsumption for economic growth. It suggested there was roomfor reform in the tax system.    Sweden should continue to cut public sector spending,especially in local government, to keep in line with itstighter fiscal policy, the report said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, PERU PRESIDENT WARNS OF RETALIATION ON SILVER, The Peruvian government's freeze on silversales, which has contributed to a sharp boost in the metal'sprice, could draw retaliation by rich nations and big tradersseeking lower prices, President Alan Garcia said.    Peru, the world's second biggest silver producer, stoppedselling its refined silver and state-marketed ore on tuesday.Since then, the metal's price has risen to its highest level innearly three years. It closed today at over nine dlrs an ounceon world markets.    Garcia said the move showed that a small nation like Perucould move international markets and did not have to acceptcheap prices for silver, traditionally one of the top revenueearners of the country.    Peru exported its refined silver last year at an averageprice of 5.40 dlrs a troy ounce. As recently as one month ago,silver bullion was trading for about 5.70 dlrs an ounce onworld markets.    "One thing is that Peru, which produces silver, sells itsilently and in a submissive manner at the price world marketswant," he told reporters at the presidential palace.    "The other is that a nationalist government says, 'wait amoment I can't sell silver at these prices,'" he added.    The peruvian energy and mines minister, Wilfredo Huayta,said the government would maintain its freeze on new sales ofsilver until the price of the metal reaches "the true value thisraw material should have." He did not specify this level.    Garcia said rich nations and big traders, faced with Peru'sstance, could try to defend themselves.    "They have some stocks, they have silver deposits, they canmake fictitious sales and that way try to make the price of ourmineral fall in the world market," Garcia said.    "Whatever manoeuvre they take will be answered by Peru," hesaid. "Peru is in a position of action."    President Garcia had recently spoken by telephone withMexican President Miguel de la Madrid, Huayta said. Mexico isthe world's biggest producer of silver.    Mexico and Peru together produce nearly nearly 40 pct ofthe world's silver, the official newspaper El Peruano said.    The newspaper added that Peruvian central bank presidentLeonel Figueroa and the head of the central bank of Mexico,Miguel Mancera Aguayo, met in Mexico City yesterday tocoordinate actions aimed at consolidating the upward trend ofthe price of the metal.    Analysts in Zurich, a major silver trading centre, saidtoday the rally in silver prices was also fuelled by investorsbuying the metal to protect themselves against inflation, whichthey fear could be rekindled by the dollar's weakness.    On an historical basis, silver is still relatively cheapcompared to gold, which some investors believe could set thestage for further rises, they said. Reuter&#3;

A Conade report, dated April 21 and obtained, said that thecountry's gross domestic product (gdp) would fall by anestimated four pct compared to 1.5 pct growth last year. Conadefunctions as the country's main planning institution.    Crude output will fall to 61.2 mln barrels in 1987 from105.6 mln in 1986, Conade said. It forecast exports of 22.9 mlnof crude and derivatives against 63.3 mln last year.    The March five earthquake killed up to 1,000 people andcaused an estimated one billion dlrs in damage. It paralyzedEcuador's crude output because it ruptured the country's mainpipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of jungle oilfields, tothe Pacific Ocean port of Balao.    It will take until at least end-July to repair the line andreturn output to normal levels, oil officials said. Ecuadoroutput was about 250,000 barrels per day before the tremor.    Conade forecast total 1987 exports of 1.77 billion dlrs,572 mln dlrs of which would be oil and derivatives.    Imports were forecast at 1.70 billion dlrs. Total 1986exports were 2.18 billion dlrs, of which 979 mln dlrs werecrude and derivatives, with total imports 1.66 billion dlrs.    Conade predicted that payments on Ecuador's 8.16 billiondlrs foreign debt will be limited to 947 mln dlrs this yearagainst 1.489 billion dlrs last year. Conade's projectedceiling on payments is not legally binding.    The current account balance of payments deficit was seen at934 mln dlrs in 1987. It was 696 mln dlrs in 1986. Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, BUNDESBANK AIMS FOR TIGHT MONEY POLICY - SCHLESINGER, The Bundesbank is trying to keepmonetary policy tight in order to counter inflationarytendencies, Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger wasquoted as saying.    "We are trying to keep the monetary framework tight, so thatinflationary pressures cannot develop," he told the FrankfurterNeue Presse daily in an interview.    "Central bank money stock does not have to be reducedbecause of this, but it must continue to grow modestly," hesaid.    Bundesbank spokesmen were not available for comment.    On Thursday Schlesinger said in a contribution to theHandelsblatt daily that the accommodative monetary stance inWest Germany caused by outside pressures could not determinepolicy in the long term.    The improvement in West German terms of trade, providingroom for non-inflationary expansion of domestic demand inexcess of output growth, put the overshoot of central bankmoney stock in a more positive light, he said on Thursday.    Central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main monetarymeasure, was growing at an annual rate of 7.3 pct in March,above the 1987 three-six pct target range.    Money stock overshot the 3.5-5.5 pct 1986 growth target.    Schlesinger told the Frankfurter Neue Presse that the phaseof falling prices was over in West Germany.    Prices might still be lower on a comparison with theirlevel one year earlier. But the cost of living index has risento 120.7 in March from its November 1986 low of 120.0,expressing a slight rise in prices, Schlesinger said.    In March the cost of living was steady against February but0.2 pct below March 1986.    Schlesinger said a rise of between one and 1.5 pct during1987 would be acceptable, and effectively mean price stability.    Agreements so far in the current West German wage round areneutral as far as inflation is concerned because of thestrength of the mark, Schlesinger said.    Wage agreements in the public service and engineeringindustry were relatively high in view of the stable cost ofliving. But the higher costs would be compensated for, he said.    "I am thinking above all of the fact that in the course ofthis year we will in all probability have a stronger markagainst other currencies than last year," he said, adding"Without this mark revaluation effect, we would have had to saythat the wage rise agreements were not neutral for prices."    Schlesinger said exchange rate movements had increased thescope for redistributing wealth this year, but this developmentwas unlikely to continue in 1988.    "For this reason I cannot comment on that part of theengineering agreement which covers the coming years," he said.    Some 2.3 mln workers for the public services received a 3.4pct pay rise from January 1. An agreement for four mlnengineering workers raised pay by 3.7 pct from April 1, andthen raises pay by another two pct from April 1, 1988 and by2.5 pct from April 1, 1989. The engineering agreement also cutsthe working week by 1-1/2 hours to 37 hours in two stages. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, EC SAYS JAPAN CAR EXPORT RESTRAINT NOT ENOUGH, Japan"s 1987 car exportrestraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough, ECexternal trade chief Willy de Clercq said.    There are also strong signs Japanese exporters arediverting cars to the EC after the dollar"s fall against the yenmade their U.S. Market unprofitable, he told reporters aftermeeting U.S., Japanese, and Canadian trade ministers.    The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversionin Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due tocurrency movements over the past two years, it will move toprevent it, he said.    Over the period, the yen has risen against the dollaralmost eight times as fast as against the European CurrencyUnit, he said.    Japan has set an unofficial, voluntary 10 pct rise in carexports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop itsrising trade surplus with the Community, which hit a record 18billion dlrs last year.    But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumpedover 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales, and aseven per cent fall globally. "We think there is some diversionthere," said de Clercq.    Japanese officials say the overall annual rise will be only10 pct.    "But even 10 pct is 100,000 cars, whereas we sell only40,000 cars to Japan (per year) in total," he said.    The EC is also demanding that Japan ease its strict checksand requirements for imported cars, which Brussels says is anon-tariff barrier.    The EC is also worried because EC demand for cars isfalling this year, making any rise in Japanese imports evenmore serious for EC auto manufacturers.    De Clercq, who has taken a hard line on world tradeproblems at this weekend meeting in central Japan, said the ECappreciated Japan"s plans to cut exports and lift domesticgrowth instead.    "But even if all these measures are implemented, it willtake time. But there is not time," he said.    "There are burning issues on the table which cannot wait. Itwere better that the fire were put out immediately and not towait till the house burns down," he said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, TOP NATIONS AGREE OVER FARM TRADE ISSUE, Ministers from the majortrading nations have for the first time made a concertedcommitment to review the whole distorted structure of worldfarm trade, Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney said.    "We think we can get some movement on this," she toldreporters at a briefing following informal talks with the U.S.,Japanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here.    Canada, strongly supported by Australia, has championed thecause of both developed and developing nations which have seentheir farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy warbetween the United States and the EC.    Japan"s protected agricultural markets have also attractedcriticism.    The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted,developing nations which often rely totally on one or two farmsector exports to sustain their economies but which cannotcompete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products.    "Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so),but many countries cannot," said Carney.    She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitudeand had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under whichto discuss the issue.    Talks will now continue at the Organisation of EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD), which meets next month, andat the series of discussions on a new world trading framework,begun at Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year.    Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive rolein the farm talks, and that the United States was willing tosee short-term progress, as long as long-term solutions werenot affected.    Canada"s five point programme demands that farm productprices must reflect open world market prices, that any supportfor farmers incomes should not be linked to productionincentives, that there should be no new farm subsidies, no newfarm import barriers, and that any decisions should beimplemented collectively.    The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by theindustrialised world until Canada raised it last year at theTokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers.    The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism havecreated some absurd situations.    For example, to protect its farmers the Japanese governmentbuys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase priceto Japanese consumers.    "So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) marketto help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make aprofit on our wheat to help pay the price support for theirfarmers," said Carney.    The problem causes pain for many nations and increases thealready dangerously high debts that they owe mainly to U.S.,Japanese and EC banks. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, QATAR"S BANKS SET FOR FURTHER LEAN SPELL, Bank profits in the Gulf oil state ofQatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks areretrenching further in one of the region"s most overbankedmarkets.    Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit forseveral foreign banks, although locally-owned operations werein some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing marketshare.    &lt;Qatar National Bank SAQ>"s (QNB) General Manager, AbdullaKhalid al-Attiya, said: "The economy is not improving as wehoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks."    Oil-dependent Qatar, with a tiny indigenous population of60,000 to 80,000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about280,000, boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bankoperations.    Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-widerecession, aggravated this year by Qatar"s severe difficultymarketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices, has taken aheavy toll on the economy and bank profitability.    As a result, the only U.S. Bank, &lt;Citibank NA>, is thoughtto be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growinglocally based &lt;Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only startedoperations in 1984, bankers said. Citibank would not comment.    Other foreign banks have retrenched, with &lt;StandardChartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow.&lt;Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to localbusiness, bankers said.    One banker added: "Weak profits are here to stay for thetime being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment."    Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last yearwhen OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return tofixed prices. However, it soon became apparent that Qatar washaving difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices.    The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crudeprices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have beenrunning in recent weeks at 100,000 and 120,000 barrels per day,well down on the nation"s OPEC quota of 285,000, oil sourcessaid.    Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar"s revenue hasled to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector toprivate contractors after a marginal improvement in January.    Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profitslast year, as did the introduction of minimum reserverequirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing hasalmost dried up as a traditional source of bank income.    Of the local banks, QNB conducts the bulk of thegovernment"s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantageits rivals cannot expect to match, bankers said.    The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1mln Qatari riyals, while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to9.0 billion, making it by far the largest bank in Qatar.    But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridgingloans for the public and private sector to tide governmentdepartments and local business over the lean economic spell,Attiya said. "Generally speaking, we are overbanked in Qatar," hesaid, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community.    Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest,&lt;Doha Bank Ltd QSC>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to27.5 mln riyals, while &lt;Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>,registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985.    The newcomer Al Ahli Bank, continued to expand rapidly andreported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during thestart-up period from August 4, 1984 to end-1985.    Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to wincommercial deposits previously held by foreign banks,increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks toreexamine their staffing levels and overheads.    &lt;Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branchlast year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profitin 1985 of 12,000 riyals.    Two other long-established banks in the Gulf, the &lt;BritishBank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered, alsofound last year a difficult climate to make strong profits.    BBME"s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in1985, but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985"s resulthad been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions.    "Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline, while localbanks are increasing their market share," Farquharson said.    BBME"s operating profit was steady in 1986, edging up to12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985. "We are expecting thesame level of operating profit in 1987," Farquharson said.    Standard Chartered"s net profit last year recovered slightlyto 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161,000 in 1985. Staffnumbers were cut last year to reduce overheads.    Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatarmeans business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopesare rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation couldprovide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest ratesmay erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore. REUTER&#3;

"A further decline in the dollar or appreciation of the yenat this juncture I would regard as counterproductive," he told anews conference.    His comments echoed those made last week by U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker, who also warned against a further dollarfall.

Currency speculators and investors are convinced that afurther dollar fall is needed to help reduce the huge U.S.Trade deficit, dealers said.

Reagan, who will hold talks with Japanese Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone here this week, said he would lift tariffsimposed last week against some Japanese products as soon asTokyo complied with a U.S.-Japanese pact on semiconductors.    U.S. Officials gave the same message to former JapaneseForeign Minister Shintaro Abe in meetings in Washington lastweek.    In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Reagan said hewould tell Nakasone: "We want to continue to work cooperativelyon trade problems and want very much to lift these traderestrictions as soon as evidence permits.    Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mlndlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of traderetaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called hisstaunch anti-protectionist policies.    "In imposing these tariffs we were just trying to deal witha particular problem, not begin a trade war," he said.    But Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation totry to turn round the record U.S. Trade deficit, which has costmillions of U.S. Jobs and closed thousands of factories.    A vote on a trade bill sponsored by Congressman RichardGephardt is expected to come during Nakasone"s visit. It wouldpenalise nations with large trade surpluses and which arealleged to use unfair trade practices.    Reagan warned Congress that such action would undercut hisability to negotiate on trade issues with Nakasone and others.    "With my meeting with Prime Minister Nakasone and the Veniceeconomic summit coming up, it"s terribly important not torestrict a president"s options in such trade dealings withforeign governments," he said.

reut2-017.sgm, TRADE MINISTERS SAY GOVERNMENTS NEED CREDIBILITY, Four trade ministers ended aweekend meeting with a frank confession that their governmentsare losing credibility in world financial markets and will notregain it until they back their promises over trade andcurrencies with action.    "Until today we have anounced policies, but when it came toaction required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,"Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.    "From now on, if a government comes up with a certainpolicy, it must be followed by action," he said following twodays of informal talks with the trade ministers of the UnitedStates, the European Community and Canada in central Japan.    Last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140yen, despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leadingindustrial powers that currencies should be stabilised tounderpin world trade.    "We need credibility to gain confidence. When we haveconfidence, then we can have an impact," said Tamura.    His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations foughtover trade issues while calling for each other to honour freetrade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspiredconfidence in the markets.    "The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If youbelong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, ifyou want to be credible," said EC external trade chief Willy deClercq. Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney also agreed: "Weare meeting in a time of great trade tension. What the worldneeds to see is that we have the political will to deal withthese problems we face."    She said that next month"s meeting of the Organisation ofEconomic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leadersof the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum toshow this will existed.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the newsconference that the results of such high level meetings couldlead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing outworld trade imbalances perhaps years later.    "The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetingslike this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way itshould be pursued," he said.    "What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceedswhat is achieved in a tangible way," he said.    Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others"positions and policies was just as important toward reducingtrade tensions, he said.    Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks:    Currency stability was now essential, but currencymovements alone would not correct a U.S. Trade deficit withJapan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr ECdeficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplusof almost 90 billion, he said.    Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible exportrestraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows weremost dangerous, he said.    The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policiesover a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrialmeasures, and in line with a body of internationally agreedrules, he said.    In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-basedGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must bestrengthened, he said.    The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises tosolve the problem. The United States will try to reduce itslarge budget deficit and restore competitiveness within itsindustries.    Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expandits domestic growth and rely less on exports.    The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth andreduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress inthe Canadian economy. REUTER&#3;

Their current chairman, Belgium"s Paul de Keersmaeker,promised at the end of the group"s last meeting that ifagreement appeared in sight this week, he would keep hiscolleagues at the negotiating table for long days and nights.    But one diplomat told journalists: "I don"t think you need toworry about that. We are a long way from the crunch yet."    The commission has tabled a series of proposals which farmexperts say would together amount to the most swingeing attackon overspending on the bloc"s Common Agricultural Policy, andthe biggest blow to farmers" incomes, in years.    As well as cuts in common farm prices of 2.5 pct in the keycereals sector, quality standards for farm goods sold into ECsurplus stores would be raised and the period of the year whensuch sales were allowed restricted.    The experts say prices received by farmers would be cut byover 10 pct for many crops if such measures were agreed.    The effects, however, would be mitigated by Commissionproposals unveiled on April 14 for generous cash grants tofarmers worst hit by the struggle to curb EC food surpluses.    When ministers met on March 30 and 31 in Brussels forinitial discussions on the farm price package, several, notablyFrance"s Francois Guillaume and West Germany"s Ignaz Kiechle,said the proposals were unacceptably tough.    Only the Dutch and British delegations gave general supportto the Commission line that such drastic measures werenecessary to curb surplus food production in the EC and toreduce the massive cost of the CAP.    But even then, the British are among several delegationswhich oppose the Commission"s controversial plan to raise twobillion European Currency Units through a tax on imported andEC-produced oilseeds and fats.    In order to seek common ground, de Keersmaeker plans tospend the whole of tomorrow in bilateral meetings with each ofhis colleagues in turn.    Diplomats said although the ministers will meet together onTuesday, de Keersmaeker is likely to conclude that furthertalks at the level of officials are necessary and that the hardbargaining will have to wait until May.

The meeting will provide senior government officials withtheir first chance to discuss the recent sharp drop of thedollar, although the main focus of the gathering is longerterm, they said.    Deputy Finance Ministers, including Japanese Vice-FinanceMinister Toyoo Gyohten, will attend. The meeting will be heldin Italy, they said, but gave no other details.    The leaders of the G-7, the United States, Britain, Canada,France, Italy, Japan and West Germany, are expected to discussways of improving economic policy coordination in Venice.    The hope is that increased coordination will help reducethe huge imbalances in world trade and calm volatile currencymarkets. But economists say the strategy has so far not worked.    Japanese officials admitted there is little more they cando on their own to stem the dollar decline, which last week sawthe currency plunge to a post-war low below 140 yen.    The officials said they expected sentiment against thedollar to change soon, once the U.S. Trade deficit starts tofall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink.    "We have already seen some signs of improvement (in thetrade picture), but the market does not appreciate it yet," onesaid.    Last week"s passage of the Japanese government budget byparliament"s Lower House also paves the way for Tokyo to takeadditional action to stimulate its sagging economy and boostimports, the officials said.

reut2-017.sgm, EC MINISTERS LIKELY TO CRITICISE FINANCE IDEAS, Plans for a new-style EuropeanCommunity (EC) free of damaging budget wrangles receive theirfirst full review from EC foreign ministers today, but areunlikely to gather much support.    Diplomats said key EC capitals would voice strong criticismof proposals that would lead to a sharp increase in EC budgetpayments by bringing member states" contributions more into linewith national wealth.    They said the EC"s current paymasters, Britain, France, andWest Germany, would lead the opposition to the plans, designedto enable the community meet the challenges of the 1990s.    Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least fivebillion dlrs, EC Commission President Jacques Delors called inFebruary for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system.    Such action was necessary, he argued, to end a damagingcycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technologicalresearch programs and regional and social spending projects.    Ironically, diplomats said, the move could spark exactlythe type of row it was intended to avoid with industriallydeveloped northern states demanding assurances the new cashwould not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members.    Delors" plans, by linking a country"s contributions to itsGross National Product (GNP), would over the next five yearsadd some 18 billion dlrs to the present budget of 34 billion.    Currently, contributions are calculated on a percentage ofValue Added Tax (VAT) returns.    Under the new scheme, all countries would pay one pct oftheir VAT receipts to Brussels. Extra cash would then be raisedin line with needs by a levy on the difference between acountry"s total VAT receipts and its GNP.    London is one of the most resolutely opposed countries tothe scheme, arguing instead that money should be made availablefrom deep cutbacks in the EC"s heavily-subsidised farm sector.    Unofficially many EC capitals secretly support thewearisome budget wrangling, taking the line that the highlydiverse 12-nation Community can only take tough decisions whenforced to do so.    The issue is further complicated by a possible generalelection in Britain and acceptance that the EC problems cannotseriously be addressed by London until those polls are out ofthe way. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, ADB DELEGATES GATHER IN JAPAN AMID CONTROVERSY, Delegates from 46 countries aregathering for the 20th meeting of the Asian Development Bank(ADB) amid concern over the bank"s role in aiding regionaldevelopment.    The three-day meeting, the first to be held in Japan sincethe bank"s inaugural meeting in Tokyo in 1966, will opentomorrow with political controversy dogging its heels.    Taiwan, one of the ADB"s founders, will boycott the meetingfor the second year in succession in protest against China"sadmission last year.    Taiwan, which borrowed only 100 mln dlrs or 0.51 pct of theADB"s total lending of 19.4 billion dlrs over the past 20 years,is staying away because its name was changed by the bank to"Taipei, China."    But the boycott is likely to be overshadowed by thepresence of communist giants China and the Soviet Union.    Moscow is attending an ADB meeting for the first time inwhat is widely seen as a first step to eventual fullmembership.    China is expected to obtain its first loans from the bankin 1987.    A senior ADB official said Peking, now the bank"s thirdlargest shareholder after the United States and Japan, wouldalso take one of the 12 seats on the bank"s board of governors.    The official, who declined to be identified, expectedsparks to fly when governors met in formal session on Tuesday.    He said calls for expanded bank lending were expected frompoorer countries in the Asia-Pacific region, hit by plungingcommodity prices, tariff barriers in export markets, a growingresources crunch and balance of payments crises.    But the U.S. Delegation was likely to repeat warnings ADBlending should stress quality over quantity, the official said.    The debate over ADB lending is fuelled by the bank"s highlysuccessful money management.    With liquid reserves of about four billion dlrs, profitshave been rising steadily and touched 287 mln dlrs last year.    The key indicator of the ADB"s reduced role in regionaldevelopment is its net transfer of resources -- loandisbursements less repayments made by borrowers -- which fellsharply to 237 mln dlrs in 1986 from 421 mln in 1985.    In 1986, the bank approved loans totalling two billiondlrs, but only to 19 of its 29 developing members.    ADB chief economist Kedar Nath Kohli told Reuters the bank"sordinary lending had declined each year since 1984.    "I"m afraid if you exclude India and China, it"s going to godown even further in 1987," Kohli said.    Kohli said developing countries in the region were enteringa period of painful adjustments.    He said one country that seemed to be on the right trackwas South Korea, which had bucked the regional trend of risingindebtedness by cutting its foreign debt by about two billiondlrs last year.    One country that has complained about the ADB's lendingpolicies is Vietnam, which charged at last year's meeting thatthe bank had cut off its aid on political grounds.    The bank abruptly halted loans to Hanoi after the fall ofthe Saigon government in 1975. Despite Moscow's presence,however, the bank is not expected to change its Vietnam policy.    The Philippines, the ABD's second-largest borrower in 1986with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs, is happy with the bank'srole.    Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters he expected thefigure would reach roughly the same level this year. REUTER&#3;

The offer values Monier's current issued capital of 156.28mln shares at 547 mln dlrs and compares with the latest sharemarket price of 2.80 dlrs, equal to last Friday's close.    Monier recently said it proposes to make a one-for-twobonus issue before June 30.    CSR will shortly announce further details of the offerincluding a CSR share alternative, it said in a statement.    CSR said it currently holds 323,000 Monier shares or only0.21 pct of the company's issued capital.    Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, the holder of 49.87 pct of Monier,has agreed with CSR that Redland will not accept the offer forits stake initially, CSR said.    Instead, CSR has granted Redland two alternative options,the first giving Redland the right to accept the CSR offer atthe same price within six months of the closing date of thebid, the company said.    The second grants Redland the option to increase its Monierholding to 50.1 pct in the same period.    The second option is exercisable by Redland at 3.50 dlrs ashare, CSR said.    Both option deals are subject to the approval of Moniershareholders except CSR and Redland.    As previously reported, Redland and Monier had beendiscussing a possible Redland bid for Monier but the talksbroke off two weeks ago.    CSR said Redland supports the CSR offer as a means ofestablishing a fruitful joint venture in building materials inwhich they both have interests. At the end of the offer, theywill discuss how these interests may be developed.    Redland has indicated that it would be prepared to considerat a later stage an increase in CSR's Monier stake to enable itto become a CSR subsidiary, assuming Redland exercises thesecond option, CSR said.    It said the offer is generous because it will give Moniershareholders a price equivalent to 16.8 times after-taxearnings in 1985/86 ended June 30, a 25 pct premium overFriday's market price and a 125 pct premium over last reportednet tangible asset backing per share of 1.57 dlrs.    The offer is beneficial for both CSR and Moniershareholders, CSR's chief executive officer Bryan Kelman said.    "The acquisition will broaden CSR interests in buildingmaterials by the addition of complementary domestic andoverseas businesses in concrete and clay tiles, metal roofingmaterials and concrete blocks and piping," Kelman said in thestatement.    "Importantly, the acquisition will provide CSR with newgrowth opportunities in building materials both in Australiaand overseas," he added.

"No specific plans exist for applying for membership," YurijPonomarev, international managing director of the State Bank,told Reuters. "It's too early to draw up any plans."    The USSR is attending the 20th meeting as an observer.    "The sole purpose is to observe and collect informationfirst hand," Ponomarev said.    He said the Soviet Union was responding to a long-standingADB invitation to attend the meetings.    "This is one of the fastest growing regions in the world,"the State Bank official said. "It is in our interest to havegood contacts."    But those strengthened contacts will not be made at theexpense of the Soviet Union's other relationships, he said.    Delegates here said the USSR move was connected to recentefforts to develop closer ties with Asia. The policy wasannounced last year by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in aspeech at Vladivostok.    Moscow's decision to attend the meetings follows itsapplication last year for membership of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Delegates said the USSR faces lacklustre growth and issearching for ways to boost its economy.    Although the ADB said political ideology is not a critierafor membership, several delegates said politics would play alarge role in any decision to allow Moscow to join.    Moscow's application would have to be approved bytwo-thirds of the board of governors representingthree-quarters of the total voting power of member countries.    The basic votes of the 47 members are all equal and totalone-fifth of all votes. The remainder are proportional to thenumber of shares held by each member.    Japan is the largest shareholder, at 15.1 pct, followed bythe U.S. With 14.9 pct and China with 7.2 pct.    The U.S. Has more than 12 pct of the total votes,insufficient to block a Moscow membership bid.

The 14th yen aid package from Japan's OverseasEconomic Cooperation Fund was also discussed.    Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably toa Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and80 billion yen.    The aid package, originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87fiscal year ended March, was delayed because of thePhilippines' change of government last year.    "The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as weare asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49billion yen," he said. "But they are likely to bring it up tothat level for the 15th package."    Ongpin said Manila had 14 projects in the pipeline for the14th yen package.    "We are trying get the 15th package mainly in the form ofuntied commodity loans," he said.    Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in softloans to finance a land reform program, for which Japan isexpected to supply most of the financing, had been put offuntil next month because of delays in preparatory work.    Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reformprogram in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting ofthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) here.    Ongpin said the Philippines is very happy about the ADB'ssupport after President Corazon Aquino took over from deposedleader Ferdinand Marcos.    "But I would like to see them push more aggressively in thefield of lending to the private sector," he said.    The Philippines was the bank's second-biggest borrowerafter Pakistan in 1986, with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs.

It said: "The introduction of credit, while undoubtedlyfacilitating business, could result in unhealthy expansion ofthe volume of money in circulation..." adding that the ordinaryconsumer must learn how to use credit wisely.     The paper said in an editorial that "a sound approach andone that will not entail the risks of introducing uncontrolledexpansion of credit into the monetary system is the present oneof issuing renminbi in larger denomications."    Today, the first two of nine new bank notes, includingnotes for 50- and 100-yuan were introduced. The largestdenomination had been 10 yuan.    The paper said the new notes are necessary because of therapid development of the economy, which has made itinconvenient to carry large amounts of cash in smalldenominations.    Economists have been urging that personal cheques, buyingon instalment, letters of credit and credit cards be introducedmore widely, it added. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, INDIAN BORROWING FROM ADB SEEN RISING, India, which received its firstloans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1986, expects toincrease borrowing this year, an Indian official said.    The official, a member of the Indian delegation at theADB's annual meeting here, told Reuters the bank is likely toapprove three loans totalling between 350 and 400 mln dlrs in1987, up from the 250 mln in two loans in 1986.    The official said negotiations on a 100 mln dlr loan forthe modernisation of the Haldia and Madras ports had beencompleted and only need approval by the bank's board.    The official said an ADB team is now in India for a surveyof the second project involving imports of railway locomotives.He said the bank was also likely to extend a credit line to theIndustrial Development Bank of India.    The ADB in 1986 extended a 100 mln dlr line of credit tostate-owned Industrial Finance Corp of India.    The official said the ADB wants to gradually expand lendingto India. "They (the bank) do not want their traditionalborrowers from smaller countries in the region to getoverwhelmed by (India and China)," he said. China is expected toreceive its first ADB loan this year.    "We are quite satisfied at having opened this new window inborrowing," the official said. "Our projects are being vettedquickly. We have no complaints."    He said the ADB in any case would not be able to matchIndian borrowing needs.    "In fiscal 1986/87 ending June India will borrow two billiondlrs from the World Bank alone," he said.    "That represents the total ADB lending to all its borrowersin 1986."    The official said total Indian development assistance frommultilateral and bilateral creditors is likely to total fourbillion dlrs in 1986/87.    Asked to comment on U.S. Criticism of the quality of ADBlending, the official said: "The ADB is a regional bank andought to have a better understanding of realities in Asia."    "You cannot apply World Bank conditionalities everywhere," hesaid. "The U.S. Cannot impose one yardstick for every country." REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, SOAKING RAINS BOOST DRY AUSTRALIAN SUGAR CANE AREA, Good soaking rain is boosting the sugarcane crop in the key Mackay region of Queensland following aprolonged dry spell relieved only by intermittent falls, anAustralian Sugar Producers Association spokesman told Reuters.    The rains began late last week, developed into heavydownpours over the weekend and are continuing today, he saidfrom Brisbane.    The Mackay and Burdekin regions, which together grow abouthalf the Australian cane crop, have been the Queensland caneareas hardest hit by unseasonal dry weather since December.    The spokesman said the rain missed the Burdekin area, justto the north of the Mackay region on the central Queenslandcoastal fringe, although recent light showers have freshenedthe crop there.    Owing to the dry spell in the Mackay and Burdekin areas,the overall 1987 Australian cane crop is likely to be below the25.4 mln tonnes crushed in 1986 for a 94 net titre raws outturnof 3.37 mln tonnes, he said.    But any decline will not be as great as seemed likely acouple of months ago when it appeared the Mackay-Burdekin cropswere going to suffer badly, he said.    Preliminary crop estimates are expected to be availableearly next month, the spokesman said.    The crush in the Mackay-Burdekin is likely to start laterthis year, in late June or early July against mid-June lastyear, to allow the cane to grow and sweeten further, he said.    The crush normally runs to around the end of December.    Elsewhere in the sugar belt, the cane is doing well, withsome mill areas expecting record crops, he said.    Industry records show variations in the crop are not alwaysmirrored in raws output. In 1985, 24.4 mln tonnes of sweetercane than in 1986 produced 3.38 mln tonnes of raws. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, BUNDESBANK CALL TO BONN ON OVER-SPENDING RISKS, The Bundesbank urged the West Germangovernment not to relax efforts to rein in spending when taxesare cut in a 1990 fiscal reform package, saying that higherexpenditure could lead to a dangerous rise in interest rates.    The Bundesbank's 1986 annual report said the government'schoice of measures to compensate for any cut in tax income wasa key political task. "There will also be consequences for thestate's attitude on spending," it said.    It added that, while tax cuts should have a stimulatoryeffect on the economy, the government should not expect anysignificant increase in tax income in the short-term.    The reform will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, ofwhich 19 billion marks will be financed through as yetunspecified measures.    The Bundesbank noted that reducing tax preferences andfinancial grants as well as raising some indirect taxes werebeing considered.    "As experience shows that a tax cut is not self-financing... The question remains of how the rest of the tax cuts willbe financed," the Bundesbank said.    The Bundesbank noted that in 1986, spending had increasedby more than the three pct annual average rise for 1982 to1986. If this three pct limit were exceeded over a long period,there would be a danger that increased new borrowing would benecessary to finance deficits.    It added that interest rates in West Germany were now low,partly because of a high influx of foreign funds. But thesituation would become more difficult if the government'scredit requirements increased massively. "The anticipatedstimulatory effects on the economy from the tax cuts could bethrown into jeopardy by higher interest rates," it said. REUTER&#3;

The procedure would be slow as an abrupt turnaround inexternal factors such as oil prices and exchange rates was notexpected. It did not specify what levels it considered normal.    West Germany posted a record trade surplus of 124 billionmarks in 1986, after 86 billion in 1985 and its current accountsurplus widened to 76.50 billion from 44.6 billion.    Signs imports would continue to rise, a factor alreadynoted at the start of 1986, while exports rose only slightly,would lead to a smaller trade surplus, the Bundesbank said.    In real terms, West German imports rose 5.7 pct in 1986while exports only increased by 0.8 pct.    Germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional6.6 billion in February from 4.8 billion in January but wasdown from 6.85 billion posted in February 1986.

reut2-017.sgm, SIGN OF SLOWING IN GERMAN MONEY GROWTH -BUNDESBANK, Central bank money stock was growingat about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987, down from9-1/2 pct in the second half of 1986, so there are signs thatthe pace of growth is slowing even though it is still abovetarget, the Bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report.    The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pctgrowth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 forcentral bank money stock. In the previous year it grew 7.7 pct,outside the 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 pct target range.    The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 waslimited by a series of external factors.    These included the revaluation of the mark, growing foreignpayments surpluses of non-banks, and currency inflows.    The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshootin 1986, as an attempt to counter monetary expansion withinterest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upwardpressure on the mark, it said.    The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realisticif a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form wereinvested in long-term bank accounts or bonds, public bonds orforeign securities, the Bundesbank said.    But if companies and private households continue to holdtheir funds in liquid forms, or if there are further currencyinflows, growth will be closer to the upper end of the range.    "The more the conflict between external constraints anddomestic objectives relaxes -- and many things point to this atthe time of writing this report -- the more possible it will beto do justice again to the medium-term concept of money supplycontrol," the Bundesbank said.    It noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards againat the start of 1987.    There would be virtually no easing of other productioncosts in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unit-wage costs.    "Nevertheless, no inflationary trends are likely to set inthis year," the Bundesbank said.    A link between excessive monetary growth and intensifyingprice rises can only be observed in the long term, it added.    The continuing trend for non-banks to switch into long-termborrowing to take advantage of low interest rates, while forthe same reason shunning long-term investments, increases therisks in changing interest rates for banks refinancingthemselves with variable-interest deposits, it added.

reut2-017.sgm, EMS INTERVENTION SAID SOMETIMES COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, Attempts to hold currency ratesrigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary Systemintramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringingfunds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates stillconsidered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said.    "The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weakertendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatoryintervention when rates hit band limits," it said in its 1986annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansioncould be caused in the stronger currency nation without itscentral bank being involved in the activity.    "For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as muchroom for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when acurrency is in a phase of weakness," the Bundesbank said.    "In addition, speculative positions are made more expensiveto hold when interest differentials are increased."    In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of theextent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention thathas taken place since the foundation of the eight-currencysystem on March 13, 1979.    Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS centralbanks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against anotherparticipating unit.    Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreementbetween central banks when speculative pressure moves acurrency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet benear any allowed EMS limits.    At the start of this year, central banks were very activelyselling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily theFrench franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew.    But the announcement by the Bank of France that it wasceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight toits then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100.    Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banksbought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986realignment until the selling petered out on July 7.    But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginaland 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention.    The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the totaleventually filtered into the West German monetary system.    Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, theBundesbank said, without naming the banks involved.    Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983realignment came close to matching moves up to last January.Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in theperiod up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as thedollar surged.    This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion fromJuly 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, FUNARO'S DEPARTURE COULD LEAD TO BRAZIL DEBT DEAL, The resignation of Finance MinisterDilson Funaro is bound to focus attention on whether Brazilwill now adopt a more flexible debt stance and move towards anaccord with creditors, bankers and political analysts said.    With Funaro in charge, Brazil's relations with creditorssank to a low ebb, they said.    Bankers told anti-Funaro jokes from Sao Paulo to New Yorkand economic analysts said the personal animosity between theminister and U.S. Bankers was a real obstacle to reachingagreement on rescheduling Brazil's 111 billion dlr debt.    Commenting on Funaro, a foreign banker here recently toldReuters, "They (banks) see his removal pretty much as aprecondition for getting serious negotiations under way."    Funaro angered the banks in February by suspending interestpayment on Brazil's 68 billion dlr bank debt.    There was also a question of personal style. Bankersdisliked Funaro's aloof demeanor and in private heatedlyaccused him of arrogance and inflexibility.    However, Funaro did not fall because he upset foreignbankers but rather because his Cruzado Plan price freeze lastyear was a massive flop, economically and politically.    However, it is in the domain of the debt and Brazil'srelation with creditors that his departure will have the mostclosely-watched international repercussion, bankers said.    It became part of Funaro's trademark that he would have notruck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thuseffectively blocking a debt agreement.    He argued that if Brazil sought the help of the IMF, theFund would lay down conditions which would lead to recession.    Funaro and others who supported this position had memoriesof the IMF austerity program in Brazil in the early 1980s, aperiod when hungry crowds stormed supermarkets.    The foreign banker in Sao Paulo said, "I think Brazil couldhave an agreement with the IMF which would allow (it)acceptable growth."    Argentina, working with the IMF, won excellent terms for amajor portion of its 50 billion dlr debt earlier this month.    Given the IMF role in the Argentine accord, a U.S. Diplomathere said the agreement had been extremely damaging for Funarobecause it showed that cooperation with the IMF bore fruit.    Mexico has also taken the IMF path and, earlier thanArgentina, clinched a favourable pioneering agreement withcreditors on its 100 billion dlr debt.    Brazil is now the only one of the three biggest LatinAmerican debtors not to have a debt agreement.    Some Brazilian opinion, particularly in the businesscommunity, is favourable to an IMF accord.    A leading newspaper, Jornal do Brazil, carried a reportfrom Washington over the weekend saying it was a myth the IMFbrought recession and the best moment for an accord was now. Asit happens, a routine IMF mission is visiting Brasilia.    The government has repeatedly dismissed speculation it isconsidering any major change in debt policy and politicalanalysts caution against expecting changes on the IMF issue.    The government of President Jose Sarney has gained areputation for chronic indecisiveness and some analysts believethe government will turn to the IMF only if it comes to theconclusion there really is no option.    But such a policy shift looks more and more likely beforetoo long in the eyes of many analysts.    One major political obstacle, Funaro, is no longer in thepicture and the economic pressures on Brazil are growing.    The sharp drop in the trade surplus, which triggeredBrazil's present debt crisis, shows no sign of being reversed.In the first quarter of 1987 Brazil chalked up a surplus ofonly 526 mln dlrs, just a fraction of the 2.47 billion dlrsurplus it had in the same period last year.    Brazilian officials concede that time is not on their sidein the debt crisis.

He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oilprices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixedprice OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demandhave been in equilibrium since March.    If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second halfof the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPECproducers have not been able to produce more oil at currentprices, he said.    But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mlnbarrels at its next meeting in June.    He said in his speech that world oil production over thelast two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or twomln barrels a day less than world oil demand.    Oil production by industrialized countries, particularlythe U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, butsome of that slack will be taken up by increased production inCameroon, India and other developing countries, he said.    This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oilproducers and consumers in the industrialized world for theupper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlierspeech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company.

Nakasone leaves on his sixth official visit to the UnitedStates on Wednesday, only weeks after President Reagan imposedpunitive tariffs of 300 mln dlrs a year on Japanese electronicgoods for alleged violation of a semiconductor pact.    Japan also faces more possible sanctions amid calls in theU.S. Congress for further action to help improve tradeimbalances.    Japan's trade surplus with the United States reached arecord 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.    Nakasone told reporters that special envoy Shintaro Abe,who has just returned from Washington, told him protectionistsentiment in the United States is severe.    "We are well aware of a movement in the United States toenact legislation," Nakasone said.    He said friends at home and abroad have advised him not togo to the United States but it is now more important than everthat he express Japan's view and carefully listens to the viewsof the United States.    "My visit to the United States at this time will be the mostimportant visit of all," Nakasone said.    While in Washington, he said he hopes to have candid andfrank discussions with President Reagan and Congressionlleaders. He said he plans to discuss exchange rate stability,economic cooperation to developing countries and U.S.-Sovietdisarmament and arms control.    On the recently imposed trade sactions, Nakasone said hewould present evidence that Japanese semiconductor imports areincreasing and that Japan is monitoring exports to thirdcountries.    "We have full confidence we can present clear evidence," hesaid. "(Therefore), we will request that the sanctions be liftedat the earliest possible time."    On the trade imbalance, Nakasone said Japan has alreadytaken action. The volume of exports to the United States hasbeen cut, while U.S. Imports have increased.    But Japanese imports from Europe and other Asian nationshave recently surged, those from the United States remain weak,indicating a lack of U.S. Competitiveness, he said.    Nakasone said Japan will continue to strive to improve thetrade imbalance but the United States will have to become morecompetitive and improve its huge budget deficit.    He said he will also discuss the forthcoming Venice summitof the seven major industrial nations in June.    "We can further enhance the efforts for improving peace,disarmament and the world economies as a whole throughsolidarity," Nakasone said. REUTER&#3;

The radio report, monitored in Bangkok on April 20 but onlytranslated here over the weekend, said the threatened damagewas spread over twice as large an area as last year.

"The Asia-Pacific region is an area of special concern forus in our bilateral and multilateral assistance."    He said Tokyo was ready to study setting up a specialJapanese fund at the ADB, like the one at the World Bank.    The World Bank fund is earmarked for use by developingcountries.    Developing countries and the United States have criticisedJapan for failing to use its trade surplus to help poorcountries.    Later this week, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone isexpected to tell President Reagan that Japan plans to extend asmuch as 30 billion dlrs to developing countries over the nextthree years, Japanese officials said. The exta ADB fundingwould be part of that amount.    "Our cooperation is intended to contibute to ... Alleviatingthe burden on (developing countries)," said Miyazawa, who isalso chairman of the ADB board of governors.    "The developing countries today find themselves in a verydifficult situation," he said. "With a few notable exceptions,those countries that are highly dependent upon commodityexports face a rough road ahead."    While the developing countries can help themselves bystriving to become internationally competitive and seeking toattract foreign investment, the ADB also has a role to play, hesaid.    Miyazawa told the meeting the bank must beef up itseconomic advice program to developing nations and must workvigorously to identify development projects for loans.    He also called for more use of loans that were not tied todevelopment projects, but provided more overall help to theborrower.    ADB President Masao Fujioka supported Miyazawa's view.    "The bank has been fondly described as the family doctor,"Fujioka said. "The bank will now have to equip itself to meet arange of services required to attend to varied needs of itsdeveloping members."    Miyazawa told the meeting Tokyo was ready to allow itsExport-Import Bank to co-finance ADB loans. These would nothave to be used for the purchase of Japanese equipment.

Washington is opposing the Japanese efforts because itwould mean the end of the long-standing parity between the twonations in the Bank, U.S. Officials said.    Right now, the two countries' voting shares are aboutequal, Japan having 12.53 pct and the United States 12.36 pct.The slight difference is due to a temporary delay in the U.S.Subscription to the Bank.

The issue is further complicated because other membernations would have to give up some of their power in the Bankif Japan were to increase its influence, he said.    Tokyo raised the issue at last year's annual meeting inManila, arguing that the 3.7 billion dlrs it has contributed tothe Bank's soft loans fund entitled it to a greater say in theoverall organization.

Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably toa Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and80 billion yen.    The aid package, originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87fiscal year ended March, was delayed because of thePhilippines' change of government last year.    "The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as weare asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49billion yen," he said.

Montri told reporters he will seek a meeting with U.S.Ambassador William Brown to determine why the U.S. Failed toset its weekly rice prices in accordance with rising worldprices during the period.    He said the U.S. Has followed a policy of weakening worldrice prices by announcing highly subsidised export prices lowerthan those quoted by Thai traders.    Thai officials said weekly rice prices as announced by theU.S. Agriculture Department were unchanged for 11 weeks up toApril 8.    Thailand, a major rice exporter, has criticised the U.S.Farm Act which provides heavy subsidies to U.S. Exportersenabling them to compete with Thai exporters.    Thai officials said average export prices of Thai rice fell19 pct last year and another 5.8 pct during the first quarterthis year.    The Board of Trade said Thailand exported 1.23 mln tonnesin January/March, down from 1.29 mln a year ago.    It said the export decline was partly due to the reluctanceof Thai traders to accept all foreign orders as world pricesdid not rise in line with firming domestic prices.    The board said, however, that Thailand may export more ricelater this year, especially to Africa, the Middle East andAsia, due to lower production in many drought affected Africancountries and to expected small exportable surpluses in Burmaand Pakistan.

The meeting will provide senior government officials withtheir first chance to discuss the recent sharp drop of thedollar, although the main focus of the gathering is longerterm, they said.    Deputy Finance Ministers, including Japanese Vice-FinanceMinister Toyoo Gyohten, will attend. The meeting will be heldin Italy, they said, but gave no other details.    The leaders of the G-7, the United States, Britain, Canada,France, Italy, Japan and West Germany, are expected to discussways of improving economic policy coordination in Venice.    The hope is that increased coordination will help reducethe huge imbalances in world trade and calm volatile currencymarkets. But economists say the strategy has so far not worked.    Japanese officials admitted there is little more they cando on their own to stem the dollar decline, which last week sawthe currency plunge to a post-war low below 140 yen.    The officials said they expected sentiment against thedollar to change soon, once the U.S. Trade deficit starts tofall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink.    "We have already seen some signs of improvement (in thetrade picture), but the market does not appreciate it yet," onesaid.

reut2-017.sgm, WORLD OIL DEMAND LIKELY TO INCREASE, SUBROTO SAYS, Oil prices have stabilized in worldmarkets and demand is likely to increase in the second half ofthe year, Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said.    He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oilprices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixedprice OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demandhave been in equilibrium since March.    If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second halfof the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPECproducers have not been able to produce more oil at currentprices, he said.    But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting,whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mlnbarrels at its next meeting in June.    He said in his speech that world oil production over thelast two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or twomln barrels a day less than world oil demand.    Oil production by industrialized countries, particularlythe U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, butsome of that slack will be taken up by increased production inCameroon, India and other developing countries, he said.    This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oilproducers and consumers in the industrialized world for theupper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlierspeech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company.    "If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resumeits former role in world oil markets," he said.    "But don't expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30dlrs a barrel, at least not in the next three or four years,"Subroto said. REUTER&#3;

The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritativeSaudi sources as saying the Kingdom's oil price policy wouldnot change "unless and until there is a strong revival in thegrowth of demand for oil."    MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi pricehawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources.    The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on thelong-term need to restore the competitive position of oil ingeneral and OPEC oil in particular against other energysources.    "Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with itsOPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint tomaintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level," MEESsaid.    The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeksof April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mlnbarrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week,causing the month's average to be below quota, MEES said.    MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures forMarch and Reuter estimates for March.    It said Iranian production had risen by 500,000 bpd thismonth to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd, around its quota level. In Iraq, withan OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd, output rose this monthto two mln bpd, not including "war relief" supplies from Kuwaitand Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said.    Nigeria, which has had problems selling its full 1.238 mlnbpd entitlement, increased its output to 1.2 mln bpd, it added. REUTER&#3;

Balladur, asked at a news conference if coordinated marketintervention by central banks was sufficient to halt thedollar's recent slide, said "each country has to fulfillcommitments" outlined in the G-7 accords.    Earlier this month in Washington, finance ministers of theU.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canadareaffirmed an earlier Paris accord to arrest the dollar's fall.

reut2-017.sgm, NORWAY BOURSE PRICE BOOM WILL NOT LAST - ANALYSTS, Norway's stock exchange has touched recordlevels, propelled by higher oil prices and foreign buyinginterest. But analysts say the bullish trend probably will notlast. Tight restrictions on foreign ownership of shares haveheld back development on the market, they say. While some ofthese rules could soon be eased, Norway's unresolved economicwoes mean the prices boom is likely to be short-lived.    Last Thursday, the all-share index reached 325.48 points tobeat the previous record of 325.31 set in mid-November, 1985.    Brokers say the new record, spurred by firmer oil pricesabove 18 dlrs a barrel which are crucial to Norway's economy,has for now set the Oslo bourse apart from the currentfluctuations on other world stock markets.    "It's an underdeveloped market...Virgin territory ," JennyTora, a Scandinavian securities analyst with London-basedstockbrokers James Capel, told Reuters.    But the attraction for foreign investors of the stockmarket, where price/earnings ratios average around a relativelylow 11, is tempered by restrictions and some nervousness aboutthe future of Norway's economy, analysts say.    Foreign ownerhsip is limited in all sectors and variesbetween 10 and 40 pct of the shares of any company - and theclass of shares rarely carry voting rights.    "It's often hard to get stocks as the quotas are full," Torasaid. "There can be problems of liquidity in the market. You canget into the market, but perhaps not get out."    Analysts said this meant that foreign interest had beenrestricted mostly to professional trading rather than clientbuying, and that the market missed some speculative impetus.    There are also no stock options, and bonds cannot be heldby foreigners in Norwegian securities trading.    Thor Bang, chief economist at Den Norske Creditbank A/S,Norway's biggest bank, said he thought the stocks boom hadlittle foundation in Norway's economic situation.    "One of the factors (in the rise) is a belief in...Politicalstability," he told Oslo's business daily, Dagens Naeringsliv.    The minority Labour government has looked increasinglystable since it came to power in May, 1986, with the formerright-centrist coalition in disarray.    But stock market analysts say continued economic problemscould soon jeopardise the bourse's bull trend, in spite of theappreciation of the crown against the dollar.    Although firming oil prices mean better news for Norway,Western Europe's biggest oil producer after Britain, analystspoint to high interest rates, uncertainty over the future priceof oil and a weighty current account balance of paymentsdeficit as threats to the bourse.    Interest rates stand at around 14 pct, while annualinflation is 10 pct. The current account balance of paymentsdeficit stood at 32.8 billion crowns last year, against asurplus of 26.8 billion crowns in 1985.    "I'd be very cautious about present stock levels," ChrisHonnor of London-based brokers Grieveson Grant said.    The record-breaking performance last Thursday meant thatthe all-share index had increased by 16 pct from the start of1987.    On Friday the index leapt another 7.78 points to 333.26.But analysts noted this was largely due to much better thanexpected profits in the first quarter from Norsk Hydro,Norway's largest diversified corporation.    Foreign investors, spurred by the appreciating crown andthe rise in oil prices, have been more prominent in the marketthis year, although they still trade selectively mainly inNorsk Hydro, Norsk Data and a few other top-traded industrials.    Earlier this month the government proposed allowing theshare of foreign ownerhsip permitted in financial institutionsto rise in a bid to boost competition. Depending on thecircumstances, the share foreign owners can have will rise from10 pct to between 15 and 25 pct.    Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest fully private oil company,has also said it will seek government permission to boostpermitted foreign share ownerhsip to 40 pct from the present 20pct. Saga shares have registered some of the strongest gains onthe bourse because of the move, adding more than 60 pct totheir value so far this year. REUTER&#3;

The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said: "Iwould not draw any conclusion from the cancellation...I wouldjust say it's the press of business."    But he added that the visit by the Japanese leader was "partof the press of business."    The spokesman denied the cancellation was linked to thecurrent turmoil in the financial markets.       Nakasone's visit is expected to be crucial for the currencymarkets. Unless the Japanese prime minister brings with himmeasures to stimulate the Japanese economy by fiscal expansionor lower interest rates, the visit is likely to be consideredby currency markets as an outright failure.    In addition, it is thought highly unlikely that Nakasoneand Reagan will agree on the removal of U.S. trade sanctionsimposed earlier this month on certain electronic goods.    But the participation in the talks by Baker, theadministration's top policy maker on international economicaffairs, suggests that hard bargaining between the two sidesmay be in prospect.       Asked if the trip by Baker, who was to have left April 30and returned May 6, had been dropped in the last couple ofdays, the Treasury spokesman replied: "I would think so."    He described the trip as "purely ceremonial."    Both Japan and the United States have a lot to lose from anunsuccessful outcome to the this week's talks.    Tokyo and Washington are aware that nervous currency markets stand ready to bail out of dollars and buy yen, whicheconomists fear could send world interest rates soaring andeven lead to global recession.

Two rounds of talks between President Reagan and Nakasone,scheduled for Thursday and Friday, come on the heels of theimposition by the United States of punitive tariffs on Japanesegoods for the first time since World War Two.    In the past, bilateral trade friction involving cottongoods, steel, television sets, textiles and cars have endedwith Japan taking on voluntary export curbs.    Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of aprotectionist trade bill by the U.S. House of Representatives.    A proposed amendment to the bill, drafted by RepresentativeRichard Gephardt of Missouri, will mandate a 10 pct annualreduction in the trade surpluses of Japan and other nationswhich have large trade gaps with the United States.    The United States last year had a record trade deficit of169.8 billion dlrs and Japan accounted for about one-third.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said recentlyhe was reasonably optimistic about the results of talks betweenthe two leaders.    Top U.S. and Japanese officials have shuttled back andforth across the Pacific to lay the groundwork for Nakasone'svisit. The last of the talks leading up to the main event willbe in Washington next Wednesday between U.S. Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz and Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari.    Nakasone will have an economic package worked out by theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and by an advisory bodyled by former Bank of Japan Governor Haruo Maekawa.    Japan plans to spend over 5,000 billion yen to boostdomestic demand, increase imports of U.S. products includingsupercomputers and give more help to developing countries,government officials said.    The government has been making last ditch efforts in timefor Nakasone's trip to address outstanding bilateral issues,officials said.    The issues include foreign access to a new Japaneseoverseas telecommunications venture and a six billion dlrinternational airport project in western Japan.    Nakasone and his party last week reached a compromiseaccord with opposition parties over a controversial sales taxplan in exchange for parliamentary passage by the Lower Houseof a government draft budget for 1987/88.    The accord, offered by House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara,virtually killed the Nakasone-sponsored plan, but left room forfuture tax reform plans, political analysts said.    Nakasone, who led his party to a resounding electoraltriumph last July, saw his popularity drop because of the salestax.    His party suffered setbacks in an Upper House by-electionand nationwide local elections in the past two months.    Mitsuru Uchida, professor of political science at WasedaUniversity, told Reuters: "I doubt that whatever Nakasone doesin Washington -- no matter how good it might be -- would helprestore his weakened power-base at home."    Many analysts said Nakasone might step down after theVenice summit of industrialized nations in June. Reuter&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, EMS INTERVENTION SAID SOMETIMES COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, Attempts to hold currency ratesrigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary Systemintramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringingfunds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates stillconsidered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said.    "The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weakertendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatoryintervention when rates hit band limits," it said in its 1986annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansioncould be caused in the stronger currency nation without itscentral bank being involved in the activity.    "For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as muchroom for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when acurrency is in a phase of weakness," the Bundesbank said.    "In addition, speculative positions are made more expensiveto hold when interest differentials are increased."    In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of theextent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention thathas taken place since the foundation of the eight-currencysystem on March 13, 1979.    Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS centralbanks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against anotherparticipating unit.    Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreementbetween central banks when speculative pressure moves acurrency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet benear any allowed EMS limits.    At the start of this year, central banks were very activelyselling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily theFrench franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew.    But the announcement by the Bank of France that it wasceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight toits then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100.    Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banksbought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986realignment until the selling petered out on July 7.    But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginaland 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention.    The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the totaleventually filtered into the West German monetary system.    Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, theBundesbank said, without naming the banks involved.    Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983realignment came close to matching moves up to last January.Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in theperiod up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as thedollar surged.    This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion fromJuly 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, TRADE MINISTERS SAY GOVERNMENTS NEED CREDIBILITY, Four trade ministers ended aweekend meeting with a frank confession that their governmentsare losing credibility in world financial markets and will notregain it until they back their promises over trade andcurrencies with action.    "Until today we have anounced policies, but when it came toaction required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,"Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.    "From now on, if a government comes up with a certainpolicy, it must be followed by action," he said following twodays of informal talks with the trade ministers of the UnitedStates, the European Community and Canada in central Japan.    Last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140yen, despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leadingindustrial powers that currencies should be stabilised tounderpin world trade.    "We need credibility to gain confidence. When we haveconfidence, then we can have an impact," said Tamura.    His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations foughtover trade issues while calling for each other to honour freetrade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspiredconfidence in the markets.    "The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If youbelong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, ifyou want to be credible," said EC external trade chief Willy deClercq.    Pat Carney of Canada said "We are meeting in a time of greattrade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have thepolitical will to deal with these problems we face."    She said that next month's meeting of the Organisation ofEconomic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leadersof the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum toshow this will existed.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the newsconference that the results of such high level meetings couldlead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing outworld trade imbalances perhaps years later.    "The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetingslike this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way itshould be pursued," he said.    "What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceedswhat is achieved in a tangible way," he said.    Progress in personal contacts and understanding eachothers' positions and policies was just as important towardreducing trade tensions, he said.    Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks:    Currency stability was now essential, but currencymovements alone would not correct a U.S. trade deficit withJapan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr ECdeficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplusof almost 90 billion, he said.    Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible exportrestraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows weremost dangerous, he said.    The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policiesover a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrialmeasures, and in line with a body of internationally agreedrules, he said.    In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-basedGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must bestrengthened, he said.    The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises tosolve the problem. The United States will try to reduce itslarge budget deficit and restore competitiveness within itsindustries.    Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expandits domestic growth and rely less on exports.    The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth andreduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress inthe Canadian economy. Reuter&#3;

The government said this would help freeze this year'strade surplus with the United States at the 1986 level.    "The surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dollars last yearfrom 4.3 billion in 1985, was projected to top 10 billion thisyear but the government has taken steps to constrain it to theseven billion dollar level," one Trade Ministry official toldReuters.    A government statement said the 2.6 billion dlrs was inaddition to about two billion dlrs of purchases made last monthby a South Korean trade mission to the United States.    The announcement follows a visit here this week by U.S.Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that if SouthKorea wanted to avoid protectionist retaliation it should notfalter in its policies to open its market and cut its surplus.    The statement said the government, state agencies and otherpublic institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars,computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical andlaboratory equipment and other products. "This amounts includes89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originallyreflected in their budgets," it added.    The list includes 1.13 billion dlrs of capital goods, 700mln of farm products, 50 mln of aluminium, zinc, polyethyleneand other raw materials, and 250 mln of steel, electronics andshipbuilding parts which would be shifted from other nations.    Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had alreadybought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn andsoybeans.    This meant the country would buy from the United Statesnearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports ofsuch commodities this year, they said.    The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs,accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrainexports and cut export financing, the statement said.

Speaking to a banking trade group, he also said the peak ofdebt writeoff has not yet been reached.    Medlin told the Bankers Association for Foreign Trade thatultimately "our nation's budget and trade deficits will bebalanced either through voluntary restraints in spending andconsumption or through forced austerity imposed by adispassionate and unmerciful international market place."    He said the continuing weakness of the dollar and therecent increase in inflation and interest rates "provide earlywarning that the classic laws of international economics stillare in effect."    He also told the association that trying to reduce thetrade deficit by erecting protectionist barriers to importswould not give lasting relief.    "However, the imposition and enforcement of fair traderules could help improve imbalances with nations which practiceprotectionism and deception on us."

reut2-017.sgm, PRESSURE GROWS FOR U.S. ACTION TO AID DOLLAR, Pressure is growing in the financialmarkets for the U.S. to take overt action to stabilize thedollar even though doubts linger that it has fallen far enoughto help redress world trade imbalances, economists and dealerssaid.    Some experts believe that a half-point increase in the U.S.discount rate, preferably in conjunction with rate cuts inTokyo and Bonn, would be enough to discourage sellers.    But many fear that more drastic action, such as a U.S.issue of yen-denominated Treasury bonds, may be needed.    Despite official warnings about the dangers of a furtherdollar decline and concerted central bank intervention, thedollar extended its recent sharp depreciation, touching a40-year low of 137.25 yen in Tokyo earlier today after closinghere on Friday at 139.30/40.    The impact on other financial markets was devastating.    In Tokyo, the stock market suffered its largest single daydecline; in London, gold bullion prices rose to four-year highsand in the U.S., long Treasury bond yields surged above 8.80pct and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 40points in hectic early trading.    "The problem now is linkage. This is not just a currencyproblem. It is affecting all the markets," said one seniortrader at a major U.S. bank.    Up until September of last year, international efforts toredress world trade imbalances appeared to working like adream; the dollar was falling in an orderly manner, worldinterest rates were tumbling and inflation was kept in check.    In recent months, however, this strategy has begun to showsigns of severe stress, with the U.S. imposition of punitivetariffs on Japan threatening to unravel this spirit ofcooperating and condemn the world to a damaging trade war.    "The markets fear that we have built up a momentum that isreally difficult to stop. A U.S. rate hike has become aninevitability," one currency dealer said.    "At this point, nothing short of a Fed discount rateincrease, ideally combined with further discount rate cuts byJapan and Germany, would seem capable of stabilizing thedollar," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.    Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc predicted a 1/4to 1/2 point U.S. rate increase before May 19 and a rise inU.S. bank prime lending rates to eight pct from 7-3/4 pct inthe near future.    But many economists feared that any moderate U.S. rateincreases, which appear unlikely to be matched by rate cutsoverseas, would be too little, too late.    "They should have done this 10 days ago. It would have donethe trick then," said one currency analyst.    "If they do it now, it would be seen as a defensive measurenot an offensive one. It would show policy weakness notstrength," added one trader.    In addition, economists fear that a discount rate risemight place additional strain on a sluggish U.S. economy andtempt embattled debtor nations to retaliate.    A U.S. discount rate increase would also fuel theprotectionist fires in Washington, where the House is expectedto pass a protectionist trade bill, whatever compromisesPresident Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone can come up withduring their summit later in the week.    "Politically, they can't really do it this week," said onecurrency analyst, pointing out that if it failed to stabilizethe dollar, it would only weaken the U.S. negotiating stance.    Even if the U.S. retains the upper hand, economists andtraders do not hold out high hopes for any major newinitiatives from this week's talks.    At best, the experts see some sort of accord whereby Japanwill agree to stimulate growth and open its domestic markets tooutsiders while the U.S. promises to lift its tariffs andsupport the Group of Seven dollar stabilization agreement.    But many fear that this may not be enough to assuage themarket's speculative selling fervor, which has now raised fearsof weak overseas interest at next week's quarterly U.S.Treasury refunding program.    Japanese and European investors have traditionally playedan active role in these auctions, which are expected to total28 to 29 billion dlrs.    Consequently, thoughts are turning to the possibility thatPresident Reagan may try to remove foreign investors' worriesabout currency risk by financing part of the U.S. budgetdeficit in yen or mark bonds, rather than dollars.    While similar action by former President Carter helped tostabilize the dollar in 1978, the White House is clearlyreluctant to take such a step, economists said.    This hesitance was amply shown last Friday when U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker said, "there might well be somewho would view (yen-denominated bonds) as a lack of confidenceby the U.S. in its own currency."    Baker added, "therefore we don't think it's an appropriatething to do."    A foreign exchange analyst at a major Japanese bank hereshared Baker's doubts. "Dollar defending measures are veryunlikely. They will confirm the dollar's weak undertone andlead to further speculative dollar selling," he said.    Thus, it may be less destabilizing for the authorities tostop trying to fight the market's bearish sentiment.    In a recent lengthy report, economists at Morgan GuarantyTrust Co concluded, "the dollar should be left free to trade atwhatever level market forces produce." Reuter&#3;

Du Pont said after-tax operating income for its chemicaland specialty products businesses totaled 393 mln dlrs in thelatest quarter, rising 55 pct from last year's first quarterdue to improved results from most businesses, notably fibers,white pigments and specialty polymers.    Results benefited from improved worldwide demand and lowercosts attributable to lower energy feedstock prices, earlierrestructurings, and efforts to improve productivity.    It said sales of these businesses were up eight pct to 4.2billion dlrs on a sales volume increase of five pct and threepct higher average prices, reflecting a weaker dollar.    Du Pont said after-tax operating income from the petroleumsegments dropped 64 pct from a year ago to 55 mln dlrs in thelatest quarter.    These results reflect lower refined petroleum productmargins and lower worldwide crude oil and domestic natural gasprices. Coal earnings were down 27 pct on lower prices.

In a speech at the World Petroleum Congress here, Rawl saidoil companies would increasingly be forced to turn to enhancedrecovery techniques, very heavy oil and synthetics tocompensate for substantial declines in conventional oilproduction.    "What our current outlook suggests is that total worldenergy consumption will continue to grow steadily in an evermore energy efficient world," Rawl said. But, he added, Exxonprojects that "despite today's ample supplies, the world willalso be facing up to inherent limitations on the availabilityof oil and gas, which currently supplies more than half of theworld's energy needs."    The Exxon chairman told some 1,500 oil executives fromaround the world that some synthetics projects could becomepractical when oil reaches 30 dlrs to 40 dlrs a barrel range inreal terms.    "The question is when and how this will happen," he said."I believe that synthetic projects will not only re-emerge butwill become commercial well below those we were thinking aboutthe last time oil prices moved substantially higher."    Rawl said synthetic fuel would become economic at lowerprices because companies are investigating "a new generation ofideas that promise substantially lower costs" and projectsbegun in the late 1970s, which have since been suspended.    Rawl also said companies must find new and more effectiveways of enhanced recovery from existing oil fields.    "It would be my view that new oil discoveries, even withadvanced technology, are likely to slow down - not reverse -the decline in worldwide oil discoveries," he said. "So it isessential to find a better way to recover more of thediscovered oil from producing fields using chemicals, solvents,heat, and other techniques."    Rawl emphasized that private oil companies need someassistance from government in developing synfuels technology."More importantly, they need to provide a political andeconomic environment that is stable enough to allow thedevelopmental process to function effectively, he said.    Rawl also said stable energy markets serve the bestinterest of producing and consuming nations by allowing bothgroups to plan for steady economic growth.    He did not make any oil price prediction, saying only thatthe economic goals of the U.S. and other nations can only beachieved if world oil prices "stabilize within a reasonablerange."    "Prices must be high enough to meet realistic aspirationsfor income and encourage resource development in the producingcountries, but not so high as to inhibit economic growth inconsuming nations," he said.    The Exxon chairman also criticized "the occasional attemptof consuming nations to try to control domestic oil prices,calling such protectionist measures disruptive to the world oilmarket. Reuter&#3;

But he said the United States would do what is necessary tosee that other nations lived up to their trade agreements.    In a speech prepared for delivery to the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce, he said, "I hope that, before long, we can lift these(Japanese trade sanctions) and that this episode will berecorded as a small incident in the building of ourrelationship."    But, Reagan added, "we will do what is necessary to see thatother nations live up to their obligations and tradingagreements with us. Trade must be free. It must also be fair."    Reagan said the decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300mln dlrs worth of electronic exports to the United States senta message it was time to complete a U.S.-Japan "trade bridge."  "The final answer to the trade problems between America andJapan is not more hemming and hawing, not more trade sanctions,not more voluntary restraint agreements - though these may beneeded as steps along the way - and certainly not moreunfulfilled agreements," he said.    Reagan said the answer was genuinely fair and open marketson both sides of the Pacific - "and the sooner, the better."    Reagan said the administration's tools for dealing withunfair trade practices met the need for both firmness andfinesse.    He said trade legislation pending in Congress would bedangerous because it would force the administration to use "asteamroller against unfair practices every time, no matterwhether the steamroller would open the trade doors or flattenthe entire house," he said.    Reagan said that ending every unfair trade practice inJapan would cut the U.S. trade deficit by only about 10 pct.    "If our trade deficit is to come down, more must be done --and is being done," he said.    "The change in the dollar's value is part of it, and sincethe middle of last year, the actual volume of our exports hadbeen on the rise," he said.

Akers repeated his assessment of the company's outlook whenfirst quarter results were announced last week that "althoughthe worldwide economic situation remains unsettled, we see someencouraging signs."    He said IBM shipments in the first quarter exceeded the1986 level, "the first time that has happened since 1985."    Akers said that IBM will increase its emphasis on serviceand support of customers this year and that by the end of 1987it will have 20 pct more sales representatives and systemsengineers than two years ago.    He said the company is accomplishing this by both moving asmany existing employees as possible into marketing and throughnew hires.    Akers said IBM will increase its U.S. software programmingworkforce, both through retraining and hiring, by nearly sixthousands people over early 1985, to a yearend total of 26,000.    Last year IBM announced that it would try to reduce itsworkforce without violating its historical no-layoff policythrough early-retirement offers and retraining.    Earlier this month, the company introduced a new line ofpersonal computers and this summer it will begin shipping a newgeneration of minicomputers it hopes will compete successfullyagainst offerings from Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC>.

Earlier today, Buchanan-Smith gave the go-ahead to MobilCorp for two new North Sea developments -- the Ness oil fieldand Beryl B subsea water injection project -- totalling 96 mlndlrs (60 mln British pounds).

Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a wheat bonus offer to the Soviet Union "is something that Ibasically leave to the Agriculture Department to figure out."    Last year, Shultz spoke out against President Reagan'sdecision to offer subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union --an offer Moscow spurned.    "I've always been a little put off by the idea that we wouldarrange our food supplies so as to price them in such a waythat the Soviet housewife could buy American-produced food forless than the American housewife could buy it," Shultz said.    "It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in worldmarkets, we have to meet the price," he added.    Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteriaof USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S.customers "questionable."    An across-the-board EEP would mark a "considerable change" inthe current program, which Shultz said is designed "to say toother countries that subsidize, particularly the EuropeanCommon Market, that we're not going to give up our markets tothose subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag thatwill meet that competition and hold our markets for ourfarmers."

reut2-017.sgm, NORTH AMERICAN GAS MARKET SOUGHT BY FERC, Blocking Canadian gas importswould not serve the long-term interests of the United States,said Martha Hesse, chairman of the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission, adding that the development of a freely open NorthAmerican energy market should be encouraged.    "I firmly believe that the long-term interest of U.S.consumers would not be served by any attempt to promote a 'Madein America' label for gas," she said at an oil and gasconference.    She said the commission recognizes the important roleCanadian gas plays in the American market, despite grumblingsamong U.S. domestic producers of the competition from north ofthe border.    Recent figures show Canada shipped 2.48 billion Canadiandlrs worth of gas to the U.S. in 1986, down sharply from the3.91 billion dlr total in 1985.    "But we do seriously recognize the importance in the yearsto come of the supplies of Canadian gas to U.S. markets," shesaid. "And even in the short term, competition is generally agood thing," she added.    She said the commission is concentrating on improving theaccess to U.S. pipelines, something that would be of greatbenefit to Canadian producers.    Hesse said transportation of Canadian gas is alreadyimproving, gas imports rising more than 21 pct in the first twomonths of the year. But Hesse declined to comment in detail onthe controversial December order, known as the "as billed issue",because it is the subject of a new hearing.    The order, which is being fought by Canada, involvesbarring U.S. pipeline companies and consumers from payingcertain Canadian shipping expenses.    Hesse said the order was never intended "as an attempt toextend the arm of U.S. regulations across the border."    However, a senior Canadian government energy officialwarned delegates the ruling could severely weaken Canadian gasproducers. "Besides the extra territorial effect, there is thepotential that Canadian consumers and producers may end upsubsidizing the cost of transportation services originallyincurred on behalf of U.S. customers," said Robert Skinner, anassistant deputy minister in Canada's energy department.

reut2-017.sgm, U.S. BEEF, CITRUS TALKS WITH JAPAN SEEN TOUGH, The Reagan administration is expected toface tough resistance from Japan and from some entrenched U.S.interests, if it hopes to succeed in forcing Japan to end beefand citrus import controls by April, 1988, U.S. and Japaneseofficials said.    Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter took a hardline stance on beef and citrus intalks here last week, insisting that the quotas be abandoned byApril, 1988.    But that stance will be difficult to maintain because Japanwill resist the pressure fiercely and because some U.S.suppliers of those commodities have an interest in maintainingthe quotas, U.S. and Japanese officials told Reuters.    Twice in the past, the United States has negotiated withJapan on beef and citrus import quotas -- during the Tokyoround of multilateral trade negotiations in 1978, and inbilateral talks in 1984.    Each time the U.S. demanded an end to the quotas at theoutset but ultimately accepted substantial increases instead.The current agreement calls for an increase in high qualitybeef imports to 58,400 tonnes in fiscal 1987, oranges to126,000 tonnes and orange juice to 8,500 tonnes.    Lyng has said repeatedly that this time the United Stateswill not settle for simple increases in the quotas. Japan hasbeen given plenty of time to reform its agricultural supportsystem and the quotas must be scrapped, Lyng said.    Japanese officials want to begin informal talks on beef andcitrus in August or September in Hawaii, sources said.    If the U.S. intends to press its tough stance, and Japan,as expected rejects the demands, the issue may then be put tothe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for settlement,which would mean prolonging the friction beyond the April, 1988deadline set by the U.S., officials said.    In interviews here, Japanese officials insist that on beefthey will not liberalize imports, regardless of the U.S.pressure, because the Japanese beef industry is not competitiveand would be damaged by freer trade.    Most Japanese beef production still tends to be on smallfarms which Japanese officials said must be protected fromcheap imports by use of the quota system.    Furthermore, while the U.S. National Cattlemen'sAssociation is strongly supporting the tough administrationposition, some U.S. meat exporters and packers are ambivalent.    This is because to some U.S. exporters and packers beefexports to Japan under the quota system are a steady, reliablebusiness managed by a quasi-government Japan Livestock IndustryPromotion Corporation. Under quotas the U.S. share of Japan'sbeef market has expanded at the expense of Australia.    In the absence of quotas, some U.S. suppliers are concernedthe U.S. share might decline and exporting to Japan wouldbecome a riskier business, meat industry sources said.    Major U.S meat industry leaders will meet in Washingtonnext week, including cattlemen, processors and exporters, in aneffort to reach an industry-wide consensus toward Japan.    The citrus industry also appears split on the quota issue.California's Sunkist, the largest U.S. supplier of oranges toJapan, has expressed reservations about eliminating quotas.    A representative of Sunkist said the cooperative isconcerned that in the absence of quotas, lower quality orangesfrom Israel and South Africa might be competitive in Japan.    Ironically, some Japanese officials hinted that freshoranges may be a product on which imports could be freed with aminimum of impact on Japanese mandarin orange production.    This is because U.S. oranges do not directly compete withsmaller Japanese mandarins, officials said. But Japan wants tomaintain quotas on orange juice because it fears imported juicetastes better and would displace Japanese mandarin orangejuice, they said.    One scenario mentioned by both U.S. and Japanese officialsis that Tokyo may try to blunt the tough administration stanceby offering to scrap the quota on fresh oranges in return forU.S. acceptance of increases in beef and juice quotas.    Lyng has acknowledged that liberalization of beef andcitrus imports is a difficult objective, but he insisted duringthe week-long tour here that it is a high priority on theU.S./Japan agriculture agenda-- more important than the riceissue which received most of the attention.    Asked about the ambivalence of some in U.S. agribusiness,Lyng noted some interests on both the U.S. and Japanese sidehave benefited from quotas but this will not stop theadministration from pressing for liberalization.    And Lyng said the administration believes it can marshallmore support for eliminating the quotas now than ever before,because of concern about Japan's rising trade surplus.    "We're coming at this one (beef and citrus negotiation)with a much stronger view coming out of Washington. The timeshave changed. The trade balance is much worse," Lyng said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, DECLINE IN U.S. DOLLAR MAY BOOST OPEC OIL PRICE, The sliding value of the U.S. dollarmay soon force the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries to raise its oil benchmark price, setting the stagefor prices as high as 22 dlrs a barrel by yearend, topexecutives with U.S. oil companies said.    The current benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel wasestablished by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC) at its December meeting when the cartel set a15.8 mln barrel per day production ceiling.    But the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar, thecurrency used by OPEC for its oil sales, is making the 18 dlrprice difficult to sustain, said Fred Hartley, chairman ofUnocal Corp &lt;UCL>.    The U.S. dollar has fallen in value by about 10 pct sinceDecember and has fallen by a total of about 40 pct during thepast two years.    Hartley told Reuters he expected significantly higher oilprices this winter and would not rule out the potential for 25dlrs a barrel by the spring of 1988.    "I think June will be the critical month to see what theydo," said Hartley, who was in Houston to attend the WorldPetroleum Congress. OPEC has scheduled a regular meeting inJune which some experts believe is likely to revive suggestionsthat oil should be priced according to a basket of worldcurrencies instead of the U.S. dollar.    E.H. Clark, chairman of &lt;Baker Hughes Inc>, said the Saudikingdom's need to generate revenues -- rather than greaterworld demand -- would drive any price increases.    "The Saudis have made committments and have a balance oftrade based on receiving 18 dlrs a barrel for this oil. But theU.S. dollar won't buy as much as it did five or six monthsago," Clark said in an interview. "I'm betting on the Saudiking's need to sustain revenues."    Clark predicted that world oil prices would top 22 dlrs abarrel by January one.    However, the authoritative Middle East Economic Surveyreported yesterday that Saudi Arabia would not seek to increaseOPEC oil prices unless oil demand showed strong growth.    Saudi sources told the newsletter that the policy was basedon the longterm need to restore the competitive position ofOPEC oil against other energy sources.    Many oil industry experts are forecasting a modest increasein world oil demand averaging one pct annually during the nextfew years.    Michel Moreau, a director of the &lt;Elf Aquitaine Group>,said he believed the worldwide oil industry had reached aconsensus that prices of at least 20 dlrs a barrel werenecessary to cover exploration costs, royalties and taxes onnew production.    The 20 dlr level will be reached this year only if thecash-strapped nations of Nigeria, Egypt and Gabon refrain fromdiscounting oil prices or increasing production levels, Moreausaid.    "I think if more than two (OPEC nations) defect, theproduction agreement will fall apart," he said. "But thisthreat is the Saudis' big stick to keep producers in line.Nobody wants a repeat of the collapse that occurred in 1986."    Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, told Reutershe expected prices would remain at 18 dlrs through the end of1987, adding that 20 dlrs a barrel was a possibility.    Other major companies are taking a more cautious view ofprices, fearing that some OPEC members may yet upset thecartel's production agreement.    "This is a year of testing," said Alfred Munk, manager offoreign affairs at Amoco Corp. (AN). "If they fail, there maybe a price decline to about 14 dlrs a barrel."    French-owned Total CFP's vice president Pierre Vaillaudsaid, "Demand is not going up very quickly, at best maybe onepercent a year. You can't change the price with just one pct,"Vaillaud said.

reut2-017.sgm, U.S. MAY HAVE TO ACT TO SUPPORT DOLLAR, The prospect of renewed assaults onthe dollar might force the United States eventually to unveildistasteful measures to bolster support for its currency,monetary analysts and economists said.    Treasury Secretary James Baker has acknowledged that theReagan administration discussed the possibility of issuingyen-denominated U.S. government bonds to support the dollar.    But he has also dismissed speculation that he was ready totake such an unusual step. Nonetheless, monetary sources saythe issue has been seriously discussed by the administration.    "It is unlikely that we would undertake to do that now,"Baker said last week. "In our view there might well be some whowould view (issuing U.S. yen bonds) as, in fact, a lack ofconfidence by the U.S. in its own currency. And therefore wedon't think it's an appropriate thing to do."    But if the Reagan administration did announce measures,they could be a part of an internationally-coordinated effortto end the instability in financial markets with genuine actionto reduce massive economic imbalances, monetary analystsbelieve.    And, like a currency defense package unveiled by the Carteradministration, issuing yen bonds could be accompanied by arise in the discount rate, now 5.5 pct.    The Federal Reserve has resisted pressure to raise this keyrate so far, chiefly, some Fed officials say, because it couldhurt economic growth. Another concern is the fragileinternational debt situation.    Analysts who expect a currency support package are dividedover its possible timing. Some even believe an announcementcould come this week during a visit to Washington by JapanesePrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.    "It would give some real focus to the visit, and it mightsteady the dollar and prevent it from going down," said CharlesTaylor, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.    But monetary sources said they thought it unlikely that theReagan administration would resort to measures which wouldbring to mind the troubles of President Carter.    Until very recently, the current administration has urged alower dollar to help redress its huge trade deficit whileCarter faced a weak dollar as confidence in his economicpolicies collapsed. But today, Washington's policies areincreasingly in question.    The Carter plan was unleashed on Nov. 1, 1978. And it was aresounding success. "This package really gave credibility to theadministration to get the dollar up," said Robert Hormats,vice-president of Goldman Sachs Inc and a former senior U.S.economic in the Carter and Reagan Administrations.    The dollar then stood at just under 1.87 marks and around188 yen. Today it stands around 1.79 marks and 139 yen.    "The problem is now that the administration in rhetoric isevidencing concern about the dollar but in practice is reallydoing very little," Hormats said of statements to support thedollar by U.S. officials.    Several currency traders and foreign central bank officialsthink these statements still fall short of unequivocally sayingthe dollar has declined far enough.    Carter issued 6.4 billion dlrs of mark and swiss francbonds aimed essentially at buttressing pyschological supportfor the dollar but also at attracting foreign investors, whohad lost confidence in the dollar, to U.S. government notes.    The package was supported by a one pct rise in the discountrate, to 9.5 pct, drawings on U.S. monetary reserves at theInternational Monetary Fund and sales of U.S.-held SDRS toother IMF members.     It was also supported by increased Fed currency swap lineswith other central banks and stepped up official U.S. goldsales.    Stephen Axilrod, a former Fed official who is nowvice-chairman of Nikko Securities, said, "I think it's veryunlikely they would do that now."    He argued that it was politically difficult to take actionto support the dollar while Japan and West Germany have stillto fulfill pledges to stimulate their economies.    But most analysts believe a currency support package wouldonly work if genuine economic measures to redress world tradeimbalances are undertaken by the leading industrial powers.    It could coincide with the June Venice summit of leaders ofthe seven major industrial democracies -- the United States,Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    Hormats said he believed the currency has to declineslightly further for a package to have impact. He said theseven nations' Paris Accord to stabilize currencies was forgedtoo soon to fundamentally change market sentiment.    "I think we're nearing a point when they would feel(politically) comfortable doing this," Hormats said.    Many analysts think the administration's reluctance to actfirmly on the dollar has been due to its desire to keep up thepressure on its allies to bolster their economies and for fearof fanning protectionist sentiment in Congress.    But Hormats said "there will be a point at which thegovernment of the United States shows it does give a damn forthe dollar." Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, GOVERNMENTS SEEN MORE INVOLVED IN OIL DRILLING, The offshore oil drilling industrywill attract increasing numbers of government connected firmsin the 1990s, according to Ronald Tappmeyer, Vice Chairman ofReading and Bates Drilling Co.     Tappmeyer told the Offshore Technology Conference thatcontract drilling was reaching the same kind of situation thatoil producing companies reached when their oilfields werenationalized in nations as Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia.     He said local connections to the nation whose waters arebeing drilled was an increasingly important factor in themarket.     "We have seen contractors put at competitive disadvantagesin nations in which they had worked successfully for yearsessentially moved aside to make room for locally-owned firms ora locally-built rig," he said.     Tappmeyer, who is president of the InternationalAssociation of Drilling Contractors, said how far the trendwould spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism.     He added that international contractors will increasinglyfind their role restricted to regions that require specialexpertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severeenvironments such as in the Arctic and extremely deep waters.     Tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies toprovide the main financing for offshore drilling in the comingdecade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposingthemselves and drilling contractors will have difficultyproviding financing out of cash flow.     At the same time, he said he saw the financing as indirectas he does not see producers getting back in the rig-owningbusiness.     He also said projectfinancing will have to be backed upby work commitments to guarantee the payoff of constructioncosts.     For the time being, he said there was a superabundance ofrigs. But he said there will be a need for new, technologicallyadvanced rigs within a few years.     He said the floating-drilling rigs were most likely tobenefit from new developments in technology, adding that by2,000 there should not be an ocean left that is too deep, toocold, too stormy or too remote to be explored.

reut2-017.sgm, EC OFFICIALS PLAN NEW EFFORT ON FARM PRICE TALKS, European Community (EC) leaders hopeto make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks onreforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when ECagriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions herethis morning.    Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessenmet Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night toplan a new initiative.    Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker, who currently chairs ECfarm ministers' meetings, were said to be disappointed by thelack of progress in the talks so far this week.    The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a toughpackage involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct infarmers' returns for many crops this year.    Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 butare only this week getting down to serious negotiations.    Yesterday, they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by2.5 pct, and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to ECstores, to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by largermargins, and to impose a tax on EC-produced and importedoilseeds, a proposal which would be likely to sour EC traderelations with the United States.    Diplomatic sources said ministers, all of whom are opposedto at least one of these propositions, maintained entrenchedpositions yesterday, making the task of de Keersmaeker insteering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one.    They said he could also be treading a minefield if hesought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers overplans to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressedin a notional common currency, are translated into thecurrencies of member states.    West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday hewould veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area,saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currencynations.    The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present apaper to his colleagues which, while not having the status of acompromise proposal, would attempt to narrow their options.    But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministerslike Kiechle, with his commitment to maintaining traditionalrural patterns, and others who see runaway farm spending asunacceptable economically, is likely to prove extremelydifficult to bridge.    They agreed with EC farmers' union association presidentHans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in Juneappeared to be the best that could be hoped for. Reuter&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, NERVOUS CONSOLIDATION SEEN IN CURRENCY FUTURES, Currency futures at the InternationalMonetary Market (IMM) are likely to consolidate near currentlevels in nervous trading conditions over the next few days,although underlying sentiment remains positive, currencyanalysts said.    "Currencies are likely to muddle around these levels," saidShearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Parker Mills.    Traders are unwilling to establish either long or shortpositions in futures because of uncertainty over upcoming tradetalks and U.S. trade legislation, they said.    Japanese prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and PresidentReagan will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss trade tensionsbetween their two countries, while at the same time theDemocratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will be voting ona controversial trade bill.    "Unless something really surprising comes out of theNakasone/Reagan talks, I don't see the dollar getting above 142(yen) and 1.83 (marks)," Mills said.    The equivalent in futures of those interbank levels areabout 0.007050 to 0.007025 in the June yen contract and about0.5500 in June marks, she said.    June yen closed at 0.007191 on Tuesday while June marksfinished the day at 0.5602.    Mills said, however, that "the chances of them (Reagan andNakasone) coming up with something new are limited." Onepossibility might be a Japanese discount rate cut, but "theyprobably won't do that unless we raise our discount rate."    Recent firmness in the federal funds rate and the FederalReserve's slowness in adding reserves to the banking system hasheightened sentiment that the money-policy making body hasalready tightened credit and a discount rate hike is possible,analysts said.    Recent weakness in currencies and strength in the dollarhas been more the result of nervous shortcovering ahead of themeeting rather than reaction to the White House statementMonday supporting a stable dollar, said Harris bank currencyanalyst Earl Johnson.    Traders "are worried about the outcome of the talks betweenReagan and Nakasone," and as the talks are late in the week,the market may not get a chance to react to any developmentsuntil Monday, Johnson said.    Until then, Johnson expects the dollar to remain in a broadrange between 1.77 and 1.85 marks and 137 to 140.50 yen.    Chicago Corp analyst John Bilson, however, expects a rallyin the European currencies over the near-term, while the yen,at this point is overbought.    "The Japanese are moving away from the U.S. market," andinvestment funds formerly directed to the U.S. are likely toflow into Europe, Bilson said.    The chief beneficiary of such a flow of funds will besterling, Bilson said.    "Sterling rates are about four pct above Japanese rates,despite the half point rate cut," Bilson said. Major U.K. bankslowered their base lending rates today to 9.5 pct.    In addition to a favorable interest rate spread whichshould attract funds, Bilson said the firm oil market and thestrong political situation of Prime Minister Thatcher also makeBritish investments attractive.    Passage of the trade bill, which includes an amendment byMissouri Democrat Richard Gephardt that would force a 10 pctannual cut in imports from countries with an excessive tradesurplus with the U.S. if they fail to remove unfair tradebarriers to the U.S. after six months of negatiations, wouldlikely pressure the yen, Bilson said.    Bilson, however, said the legislation is unlikely to pass,but that Nakasone is likely to bring a promise to open Japanesemarkets to U.S. goods and back it up with government contractswith U.S. manufacturers.

reut2-017.sgm, GLOBAL ECONOMIC ILLS MAY TAKE YEARS TO RESOLVE, A study by the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development says it may take yearsto resolve the huge economic imbalances now plaguing the worldeconomy, U.S. and western officials said.    The paper was expected to stimulate policy debate amongsenior officials of leading industrial nations preparing fornext month's annual meeting of finance ministers in Paris.    The May 11-13 ministerial meeting of the 24-nation OECD, aforum for coordinating economic policies, has taken on addedsignificance in view of the difficulties dogging the attemptsof major nations to achieve joint goals.    Despite two meetings of the seven leading industrial powers-- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,Italy and Canada -- pledges to change policy have still to beturned into action.    As a result, financial markets have been unusually unstableand have focussed their attention on every internationalmeeting for clues that change is in the air.    The study concludes that there needs to be much greaterfiscal action by the United States, West Germany and Japan toreduce their massive trade imbalances, a U.S. official said.    "We looked at what we could do to get from here to there.We've got to continue cutting the deficit, and there needs tobe domestic expansion (in West Germany and Japan)," the officialsaid, noting that significant actions are called for.    Officials noted the study strongly underscores the need foraction by West Germany and Japan.    Seperately, western officials said they understood thatU.S. overtures to Japan and West Germany to cut theirshort-term interest rates have been rebuffed for now.    Such rate reductions would have helped stabilize the steepdecline of the dollar, by widening the difference between bondyields in the United States, on the one hand, and in Japan andWest Germany on the other.    One official said that while the policy actions called forwere similar to those urged by the seven, the study shows "it'sgoing to take several years to resolve (the tradeimbalances)."    The OECD has set three pct as the necessary target foraverage annual growth in the industrial world if tradeimbalances are to be corrected and the Third World debt crisiskept under control.    The study strongly implies these targets will not be metwithout major action by the three leading nations, officialssaid.    Equally, it suggests that without major fiscal expansion byBonn and Tokyo, and a corresponding deep reduction in the U.S.budget deficit, the current trend of an upturn in U.S. interestrates and a weakening dollar will go uncorrected.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker says the dollar's deepdecline alone will shave only 15 billion dlrs off the roughly140 billion dlrs U.S. deficit in goods and services this year.    But the study group also found that progress has been madeand the seven main nations are moving in the right direction.    In Paris this February, the seven agreed that fiscalactions by the three major powers would help them stabilizecurrencies around levels ruling then.    The Reagan administration, this week facing the prospect ofa tough trade bill aimed at curbing foreign trade surpluses,also promised to fight protectionism.    The officials said Washington must move ahead with budgetdeficit cuts of around 36 billion dlrs, a figure set as a goalby the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives.    They also called for significant increases in the budgetdeficits of Japan and West Germany. Since the study group met,Japan has announced a roughly 35 billion dlr supplementarybudget which was warmly welcomed by Washington.    Nonetheless there is caution over both the timing and thecontent of the proposed Japanese budget.    Financial markets, unconvinced by yet another Japanesepromise of action, have pushed the yen sharply higher againstthe dollar.    While no West German fiscal action is promised beforeJanuary 1988, U.S. officials would welcome such a move. "We'dlove them to accelerate their tax cuts," one official said.    West German economic growth fell steeply in the firstquarter this year, but the official said Bonn has reassuredU.S. officials they expect growth to pick up again.    If faster German growth fails to emerge, Bonn could finditself under pressure to speed up tax cuts planned for early1988 when leaders of the seven meet in Venice this June. reuter&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, SOVIET SAYS DATA SHARING WILL HELP FIND OIL, A Soviet geologist said scientists needto coordinate data about onshore and offshore oil deposits tohelp identify global formations that would indicate otherpotential discoveries of oil and gas reserves.    Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich, the head of petroleumgeology at Moscow State University, told delegates at the WorldPetroleum Congress that exploration efficiency could also beimproved through new and more sophisticated technology.    "We should emphasize that when having the data aboutpetroleum distribution onshore and offshore, it is possible toclarify the idea of global regularities in oil and gasprospects," Semenovich said. "However, much work should be doneto coordinate data concerning the structure and oil and gasprospects in adjoining onshore and offshore basins."    Sharing the information could help geologists betterpredict regional trends and underground formations thatindicate the presence of oil or gas, he said.    Semenovich also said that existing estimates of thepotential oil and natural gas resources of the world may needto be revised upward as oil companies continue to examineunexplored regions.    The world, which has already produced 476 billion barrelsof oil and gas, has a current total of about 733 billionbarrels in proved reserves. Undiscovered resources areestimated at about 1.4 trillion barrels, or about half of thetotal ultimate reserves, Semenovich said.    "There are a lot of unstudied regions all over the worldand, as far as the already known basins, one continues to findadditional reserves," he said, noting that Antarctica has beenvirtually ignored. "The existing estimate of potentialresources of the world may need to be enlarged."    To find deeper and more expensive reserves, scientists willneed to use 3-D mapping of underground formations and laserspectrometry to measure bitumen in soils and plants among othertechniques, he said.    He estimated that continental slopes contain about 10 to 13pct of all offshore reserves.    Semenovich also said that virtually all of the total oiland gas resources now estimated to exist in the world would bediscovered and placed in production during the next 50 years.    After his speech, Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oilproduction was increasing. "The difficulties of 1985 have beenovercome and we're now back to normal production," he said.    The Soviet Union, the world's largest producer of oil, hadexperienced drilling and technical problems that cut totalliquids production from 12.45 mln barrels a day in 1984 to 12.1mln barrels a day in 1985. Last year, the Soviets produced anestimated 12.3 mln barrels.    When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coalgasification project in Soviet Central Asia, Semenovich saidthe project was important because of the lack of oil reservesin the region.    Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oilprices the coal gasification process would become economicagain. "It's too expensive for the time being," Semenovichsaid.    "Theoretical development is underway and tests are beingrun. For the moment, coal gasification is a very small part ofthe energy industry," he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, ADB MEETING ENDS, MARKED BY CRITICISM, The Asian Development Bank (ADB)today wound up a three-day meeting which was marked bycriticism of the ADB from both rich and poor member nations.    In speech after speech, the 20-year-old ADB was chargedeither with not doing enough to help countries in the region,or with funding projects which were not worthwhile.    The attacks often, but not always, broke down alongdeveloped and developing country lines.    The former, which provide the ADB with money, generallyemphasized the need for quality projects.    The ADB was not even spared criticism from its host countryand largest shareholder, Japan.    "I am not 100 pct satisfied with the performance of the ADB,"Japanese finance ministry deputy director-general FumiyaIwasaki told Reuters.    He said the Bank had only approved five pct more new loansin 1986 than in 1985. He hoped for a return to the more rapidgrowth rates of earlier years.    "The Asian economy is now changing. The ADB should adaptitself to those changes," he said.    But supporters of the ADB said it already was changing, andIwasaki made it clear Japan welcomed the steps being taken bythe ADB's president Masao Fujioka.    "So far, we have confidence in Mr Fujioka's leadership,"Iwasaki said.    To spur demand for loans, the ADB has restructured itscountry and agricultural departments to enable it to identifythe needs of developing member countries more quickly.    But some delegates said the ADB was putting too muchemphasis on the need to give out more money, and not enough onchecking the quality of the projects involved.    "The success of the Bank should not be measured by thevolume of its lending but by its contribution to thedevelopment process," chief U.S. Delegate Charles H. Dallaratold the meeting.    He said: "Project quality is an area which has attractedattention recently and on which the United States has expressedstrong views. Although over the years the majority of ADB loanshave been sound, we have had problems with some of the projectsbrought before the board of directors lately."    Australia voiced similar concerns.    Australian delegate C. J. Hurford said: "Bad projectsbenefit neither the Bank nor its borrowers. They damage theBank's reputation and ultimately lessen support from donorcountries and capital markets."    There were also criticisms of proposals from developingcountries that the ADB make more of its loans dependent oneconomic reforms in Third World nations.    "We are concerned with the Bank's increasing preoccupationwith dialogue," said India's delegate, S. Venkitaramanan.    "We have expressed our unhappiness with the insistence ofmulti-lateral agencies on global prescriptions," he said. REUTER&#3;

He told Reuters in an interview that he expected grossdomestic product to expand by only four pct in 1987. He said itaveraged five pct over the past three years.    For the first two years after the present troubles began in1983, production of key commodities like tea, rubber, coconutsand rice kept up, he said.    Tamils on the island are fighting for a seperate state.    De Mel said: "Private sector production in fact grew by 25pct in 1984 and 20 pct in 1985. But last year things took aturn for the worse."    He said prices of tea, the main export, fell to half their1984 levels. World prices of rubber and copra also fell.    "There was also a decline in income from tourism andremittances from Sri Lankans working in the Middle East."    He said any savings from the worldwide drop in crude oilprices were wiped out by the cut in commodity earnings.    "To add to all this we have had, between January and Marchthis year, the worst drought I have seen in my life," he said.    De Mel said the drought would seriously affect agriculturalproduction.    He said because of the fighting in the country, defenceexpenditure was now about 20 pct of the national 1987 budget of70 billion rupees.    Sri Lanka planned to borrow about 600 mln dlrs in 1987 fromthe World Bank and the Sri Lanka Aid Consortium which comprisesmembers of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD), he said.    "We also plan to ask the International Monetary Fund foranother 200 mln dlrs through a structural adjustment facilityand a compensatory financing facility to balance our exportrevenue cuts," de Mel said.    He said despite the unrest, Sri Lanka had succeeded inkeeping its total foreign debt to three billion dlrs byavoiding borrowing from commercial banks.    "Commercial bank debt accounts for only 15 pct of our totalforeign debt," he said.    He said the Mahaweli hydro-electric project was nearingcompletion. It was likely to cut dependence on oil imports.    "The project will more than treble our hydro-electric powerfrom 300 megawatts to nearly 1,000 megawatts," de Mel said.    He said 20 new townships would rise around the project,which is in the north-central part of the island. It wasexpected to irrigate 1.2 mln acres of land and indirectlyprovide employment for 500,000 landless families.    De Mel said Tamil guerrillas were waging a war of attritionin the island's north and east. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, ADB CHIEF SAYS CHINA LIKELY TO BORROW 300 MLN DLRS, China is likely to borrow up to300 mln dlrs this year from the Asian Development Bank (ADB),president Masao Fujioka said.    The loans would be China's first from the ADB.    "I think there will be at least one loan to China this year,and possibly a second," Fujioka told a news conference at theend of the ADB's annual meeting here.    Asked how large the loans were likely to be, Fujioka saidhe thought they would range from 100 mln to 150 mln dlrs each.    China is the ADB's newest member, joining in March 1986.    China is the third-largest shareholder after Japan and theU.S.. It was elected to the ADB's 12-member board yesterday.    Fujioka announced that the ADB's 1989 meeting would be heldin Peking. The 1988 meeting will be held in Manila.    Fujioka said the ADB would consider delegates' suggestionsthat it set up a task force of experts to define its futurerole. The ADB's performance was criticised by both its rich andpoor members at the three-day meeting just finished.    External experts had carried out a study on ADB policy forthe 1980s, Fujioka said. He said a similar study for the 1990swould be useful, but the ADB had no fixed ideas yet.    He said the ADB had already responded to members like theU.S., Which urged it to improve analysis of funded projects.    "We had already decided that the ADB should strengthen itsresearch capability," Fujioka said.    He said ADB lending had declined, but "the amount is not theonly thing that counts. We also want to be a catalyst by takinginnovative measures like the promotion of the private sector."    Fujioka also talked of the struggle between the U.S. AndJapan over their voting power in the ADB.    Total Japanese contributions to the ADB are higher thanthose of the U.S., So Japanese delegates asked for their votingpower to reflect this. The U.S. Opposed the move.    "It is advisable and wise, for institutions like the ADB tobe viable, that there be a reasonable relationship betweenfinancial contributions and voting power," Fujioka said.    But he indicated the problem remained unresolved.    Asked if the ADB would respond to a plea by Vietnam toresume lending which was cut off in 1974, Fujioka re-iteratedhis view that conditions there were not conducive to banking.    Fujioka declined to elaborate on Vietnam, but said therehad been no pressure from the U.S. Or any other country on theissue.

reut2-017.sgm, TAIWAN RESERVES RISE ON TRADE SURPLUS, SPECULATION, Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves haverisen to a new high of 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, and officialsattribute the increase to a surging trade surplus and theinflux of speculative funds.    The reserves, up from 54 billion dlrs on April 19, comparewith 27.3 billion a year ago, the Central Bank said.    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-shien told Reuters: "Therising reserves will certainly intensify our trade frictionwith the U.S."    A central bank official, who declined to be named, saidTaiwan's trade surplus is expected to exceed 5.5 billion U.S.Dlrs in the first four months of 1987, against 4.25 billion ayear ago.    The influx of speculative funds, mainly from Hong Kong,Japan and the U.S., Also played a major role behind the rise ofthe reserves, he said, but declined to give figures.    Banking sources said almost 10 billion U.S. Dlrs hadentered Taiwan since early 1986. About three billion of thefunds were remitted through different channels, including theblack market, since the start of this year, they said.    Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Councilfor Economic Planning and Development, said he expects thereserves to rise in the next few months because of thecontinuing high level of Taiwan's exports and the steadyappreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency.    "The latest government moves to open (the domestic) market,cut import tariffs and lift foreign exchange controls haveachieved little success," he said.    Vice economic minister Li Mo said tariffs were cut on some1,700 products in January and a further 862 this month in a bidto encourage more imports, especially the U.S.    More tariff cuts on about 300 imported products, includingtelevisions, video tape recorders, cosmetics and refrigeratorswill be announced in a month or two, Li said.    Li's colleague, Wang Chien-shien, said the government willsend several trade missions to the U.S. This year to buy aboutone billion U.S. Dlrs of products, including machinery, powerequipment, grains and precision tools.    "We earnestly hope to reduce our trade surplus with theU.S.," he said.    Taiwan's trade surplus rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S.Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985, and it widened to3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 against 2.78 billiona year ago, official statistics show.    The surplus has increased U.S. Pressure on Taiwan for afaster appreciation of its currency, which has risen by about18 pct since September 1985.    It opened at 33.10 to the U.S. Dollar today.

reut2-017.sgm, GERMAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN MARCH, West Germany's current accountsurplus widened to a provisional 8.8 billion marks in Marchfrom a slightly downwards revised 6.5 billion in February, aspokesman for the Federal Statistics Office said.    The trade surplus fell to a provisional 10.1 billion marksfrom 10.4 billion in February.    The Statistics Office had earlier put the February currentaccount surplus at a provisional 6.6 billion marks. Theprovisional February trade surplus was confirmed.    The Office said the March trade surplus had also risenstrongly from the year-ago month total of 8.5 billion marks,while the March current account surplus compared with only 4.3billion marks a year earlier.    The figures given by the office show nominal trade flows,but an office statement said that the current account surplushad also risen in real terms from February.    However, it attributed this partly to the fact thatpayments to the European Community had been brought forward inFebruary, with the result that transfers abroad in March wereunusually low.    The Statistics Office said March imports totalled 36.93billion marks, a rise of 15 pct from February and of 4.7 pctcompared with March 1986.    March exports of 47.06 billion marks were 11 pct higherthan in February and 7.6 pct higher than in March last year.    Other data reported in the current account balance showedthere was a 400 mln mark deficit in supplementary trade items,a 500 mln mark deficit in the services account and a 400 mlnmark deficit in transfer payments.    The Statistics Office said that in the first three monthsof this year the trade surplus had risen to 27.8 billion marksfrom 22.6 billion marks in the same period last year.    The current account surplus had risen to 20.0 billion marksfrom 15.6 billion. REUTER&#3;

Yurij V. Ponomarev, international managing director of theState Bank, said he will file a formal report when he returnsto Moscow, but it will not contain any recommendation onmembership. "We haven't started any process with a view towardmembership," he said.    Ponomarev downplayed the significance of his attendance,saying it only signalled a slight change in attitude by Moscow.Although this is the first time Moscow has attended the ADB'sannual meeting as an observer, Soviet bankers have come tomeetings in the past as guests, he said.    Delegates here saw the Soviet move as part of an overallstrategy to strengthen ties with Asia and improve thefunctioning of the Soviet economy.    Ponomarev declined to comment on remarks yesterday by asenior U.S. Official, who warned that Soviet membership in theADB would cause serious operational problems.    "How would the ADB, for instance, use the (Soviet) rouble asa basis for expanding its capital?" asked the U.S. Official, whodeclined to be identified.    Ponomarev said: "It is far too premature to speculate on thepotential difficulties that might be involved if we applied formembership."    In order to become a member, Moscow would have to gain thebacking of two-thirds of the board of governors representingthree-quarters of the voting power of member countries.Washington has just over a 12 pct voting share.

Japan, which holds 15.1 pct of the ADB's capital stock, andthe U.S. Which holds 14.9 pct, currently have near-parity invoting power.    "The ADB was set up in 1966 as a partnership between theU.S. And Japan," the official said.

Chang's remarks to parliament were in response to a call onMonday by about 20 members of the parliament who asked thegovernment to diversify into other currencies, including yen,marks and Swiss francs because of exchange rate losses.    The legislators said the bank lost about 3.8 billion U.S.Dlrs between September 1985 and September 1986 as the Taiwandollar rose to 36.77 to the U.S. Dollar from 40.45.    They said they expected the losses to continue because ofthe rising Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency.    Chang said the central bank could not sell the U.S. Dollarslike other private banks or enterprises because such tradingwould be speculative and risky.    "The U.S. Dollar is an international currency and is widelyused among trading nations," he added.

reut2-017.sgm, EC FARM MINISTERS END PRICES MEETING STILL DIVIDED, European Community (EC) agricultureministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeplydivided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of theEC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns.    Their chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker, told a newsconference after the meeting he would work on a paper settingout possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks, withthe hope that the ministers can get down to detailednegotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18.    But diplomats said the talks this week had served littlemore than to clarify member states' positions on the complexpackage of measures proposed by the commission.    The executive body has proposed measures which would resultin price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct.    Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced andimported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion Europeancurrency units, to help the EC's cash crisis, and changes inthe conversion of EC common farm prices into nationalcurrencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German andDutch farmers.    De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differencesbetween EC states on the oils tax proposal, the currencymeasures and the key question of cereals prices and associatedmeasures.    But he told journalists, "We have used this meeting to reachthe point at which real negotiations can start at the nextmeeting. Ideally they should have started now but ourprocedures took much longer than planned."    Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price packageby April 1 each year, although this target is seldom reached inpractice.    Diplomats said on all the points there were widelydiverging views, with Britain and the Netherlands, thecountries most supportive of commission proposals for cerealsprice cuts, strongly opposed to the oils tax.    However, de Keersmaeker said West German objections to themonetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue toresolve. "This is a very tough political nut, and because of thevery nature of the problem there is no technical solution," hesaid. Commission sources said farm commissioner FransAndriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of hisproposals to make an agreement easier.    However, because of the EC's budgetary crisis, he hadlittle room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact ofhis proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers, led byGermany's Ignaz Kiechle, are demanding.    EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that theEC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over fivebillion Ecus by the end of this year, even if the commissionfarm price package is adopted in its entirety.

He told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch the world waschanging rapidly and national attitudes had to alteraccordingly if growth was not to falter and world depressionset in.    Liberalisation of world trade in money, goods and servicesand technology was an overriding goal, he added.    World financial flows were now 12 times as large astraditional trade flows, the importance of commodities wasdeclining rapidly, countries such as those on the Pacific Rimwere becoming major growth areas, and the labour element inmanufacturing was declining sharply, Streator said.

reut2-017.sgm, SWISS PREPARED TO INCREASE CURRENCY INTERVENTION, The Swiss National Bank isprepared to increase its intervention on currency markets ifthe action can be properly coordinated with other centralbanks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three mandirectorate, said.    He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that interventionto support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes inexchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes ineconomic policy.    However, intervention could send signals that wouldcontribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements.    The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperationwith other central banks, especially where convincingcoordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lussersaid.    He said currency developments could not simply be talkedinto existence but needed to be matched by actions in the fieldof economic policy.    "Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise thedollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit anda slowdown in money supply growth in the United States areunavoidable," he said.    The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedlyin the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it hadintervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since lastOctober.    Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stabilitylay not in currency intervention by central banks but only inan improvement in international economic policy coordination.    This meant that industrial countries must avoid abruptswitches in economic policy and give priority to pricestability.    Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the viewthat easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatiblewith its primary goal of combatting inflation. The bank targetis for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987.    He noted that in 1978, when the Swiss franc rose sharplyagainst all currencies, the bank was forced to abandon itsmoney supply targets in favour of an exchange rate target, withthe result that inflation surged.    "Current exchange rate developments have not, until today atany rate, made any such measures by the National Banknecessary," he said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, LOWER MARK RATE SPECULATION NOT SHARED IN GERMANY, Speculation abroad that theBundesbank will steer money market rates lower, opening thefor interest rate cuts around Europe, is not shared by manyeconomists and money market dealers within Germany.    Speculation has developed that the Bundesbank wouldengineer lower rates to take pressure off the dollar/mark.    A strong rise in U.S. Market rates this month, promptingspeculation the Fed would raise its 5-1/2 pct discount rate,has raised the question whether Germany and Japan would alsobroaden interest rate differentials to support the dollar.    The U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is the key to the interestrate outlook, money market dealers in Paris said.    Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could takepressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said.    Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if thetrade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said.    But if no solution is found, the Paris dealers said, arenewed dollar fall would put strains on the mark/French francrate and force the Bank of France to raise short-term rates.    The three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate rose to six pctthis week from 5.6 pct at the start of April, and the yield onthe 30-year benchmark treasury bonds rose this week in Tokyo toa 14-month high of 8.86 pct from 7.66 pct in late March.    The dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above140 yen, underpinned by higher U.S. Rates and the Fed discountrate speculation.    But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which wouldput pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates.    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said yesterdaythe U.S. Had requested Japan to cut short-term interest rates.    The Bank of Japan was making efforts to do this, he said,adding the U.S. Had not asked for a cut in Japan's 2.5 pctdiscount rate, a move which Bank of Japan Governor SatoshiSumita said was not under consideration.    A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch centralbank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bankfavoured a cut in West German interest rates and would followsuit if it happened.    Citibank AG said in its April report that another expectedphase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut keymoney market rates in the next three to six months.    The Bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct onrepurchase pacts since February, with call money trading around3.70 pct for much of April.    Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reidsaid the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further,either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interestrate, allowing the market to set the rate.    "I'm fairly confident we'll see lower rates," he said.    Reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase ratewould have little impact on the German economy or fundamentalexchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions.    "A cut in German rates wouldn't be bad for the dollar, but Ithink its effect would be limited in duration unless it wasaccompanied by other measures elsewhere," he said.    Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad thatthe Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said theBundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at themoment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month.    The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to aninterest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month. Thatshould not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however,they said.    The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interestrate tenders, following the introduction of a new system tospeed up the tender process at the start of April, they said.    Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at theDIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said theBundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts.    "I don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a littleit would stop a wave of (currency) speculation," he said. But asharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force theBundesbank to take some action, he said.    Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut ininterest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth.    Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that themonetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows ratherthan credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate responseto excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to makethe mark and mark investments less attractive.    Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investorswould switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, whichhave swollen central bank money stock, into securities, whichwould take them out of the Bundesbank's key monetary measure.    A cut in interest rates at this stage however would leadinvestors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the nextmove would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buyingbonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen.    There are so far no signs that German investors areswitching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbankhopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bankeconomist Hermann Remsperger said.    But Phillips and Drew's Reid said prospects of lower ratesand a strong currency would attract foreign investors intoGerman bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors.    Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerlandin Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates wouldcontinue to drift lower in many European countries.    "The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britainbut more limited in West Germany, where we could see someconsolidation," he said. Switzerland could be forced to matchany cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising furtheragainst the mark, he said.    Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut inU.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as thepound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, SWISS PREPARED TO INCREASE CURRENCY INTERVENTION, The Swiss National Bank isprepared to increase its intervention on currency markets ifthe action can be properly coordinated with other centralbanks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three mandirectorate, said.    He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that interventionto support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes inexchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes ineconomic policy.    However, intervention could send signals that wouldcontribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements.    The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperationwith other central banks, especially where convincingcoordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lussersaid.    He said currency developments could not simply be talkedinto existence but needed to be matched by actions in the fieldof economic policy.    "Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise thedollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit anda slowdown in money supply growth in the United States areunavoidable," he said.    The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedlyin the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it hadintervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since lastOctober.    Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stabilitylay not in currency intervention by central banks but only inan improvement in international economic policy coordination.    This meant that industrial countries must avoid abruptswitches in economic policy and give priority to pricestability.    Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the viewthat easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatiblewith its primary goal of combatting inflation. The bank targetis for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987.    He noted that in 1978, when the Swiss franc rose sharplyagainst all currencies, the bank was forced to abandon itsmoney supply targets in favour of an exchange rate target, withthe result that inflation surged.    "Current exchange rate developments have not, until today atany rate, made any such measures by the National Banknecessary," he said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, U.K. ECONOMY STRONGER THAN AT BUDGET, LAWSON SAYS, The U.K. Economy looks stronger than itdid only last month, when the government unveiled its budgetfor fiscal 1987/88, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid.    He told Parliament that "all the indicators that have beenpublished since the budget confirm that, if anything, we aredoing even better than I suggested then." The budget wasunveiled on March 17.    "The PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing Requirement) has come outlower than I forecast in the Budget. Inflation, too, is lowerthan I suggested ... (and) the current account of the balanceof payments is also performing better, so far, than Ipredicted."    The budget foresaw inflation easing to 4.0 pct at the endof this year after peaking at around 4.5 pct. Lawson said atthe time that the overall 1986/87 PSBR would be around 4.0billion stg. It was in fact lower, at 3.3 billion stg.    He had also projected average GDP growth in calendar 1987of 3.0 pct after 2.5 pct in 1986. Lawson today said "outputappears to be rising, if anything, rather faster."    Speaking during a House of Commons debate, he said, "by theend of this year we will have registered the longest period ofsteady growth, at close to 3.0 pct a year, that the Britisheconomy has known since the (Second World) War."    The 1987/88 budget contained a proposal to cut the basicrate of taxation by two pence, to 27 pence in the pound.    Lawson today reaffirmed that the government aimed tofurther cut the standard rate to "no more than 25p." He said thatthat objective "should not take too long to achieve."    Turning to policies proposed by political oppositionparties, Lawson said those advocated by the Labour Party wouldentail extra public expenditure of some 34 billion stg.    That, he said, "would require either a doubling of the basicrates of income tax or more than trebling the standard rate of(valued added tax) VAT," which is currently 15 pct.    On value added tax, Lawson noted that the Conservativegovernment promised back in 1984 not to extend VAT to food.    "Beyond that, the incidence of taxation has to be determinedin the light of the budgetary needs at the time, and noresponsible government could conceivably take any otherposition," he said. Labour MPs have accused the Conservatives ofplanning VAT increases for some essential consumer goods.    Lawson reiterated his belief that reductions in taxationcan often produce higher, not lower, revenues  "thus leading tothe scope for still further reductions in taxation."    Lawson said "inheritance tax is expected this year to yieldalmost 50 pct more in real terms than Capital Transfer Tax didin 1978-79. The yield of Capital Gains Tax is forecast to be 80pct higher in real terms, and Stamp Duty up by 140 pct."    He said that "the greatly increased yield of CorporationTax, reflecting greatly increased company profitability, isclearly connected with the reform of Corporation Taxation Iintroduced in 1984, which brought the rate of tax on companyprofits in this country to the lowest in the industrialisedworld."

reut2-017.sgm, ENERGY/HEAVY OILS, The oil price collapse of 1986 putdevelopment of a vast petroleum resource -- heavy and extraheavy oils -- on hold. But as oil prices increase the long-termeconomic outlook is favorable, oil industry experts said.    "Estimated potential world reserves of extra heavy oilsexceed 500 billion barrels, of which more than half are locatedin Venezuela," Juan Chacin Guzman, President of Petroleos deVenezuela told the World Petroleum Congress.    "And this virtually unused resource represents a primeexample of the need to invest in technology to ensuretomorrow's energy future," he added.    Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor oflight oils because of economics and a very limited market. Notmany refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils.    "Improved technology has the potential for reducing thecapital investment and operating costs of typical heavy oildevelopment projects by 30 pct or more," Gordon Willmon, VP andgeneral manager, oil sands and coal department, Esso ResourcesCanada Ltd said at the World Petroleum Congress.    Crude oil prices fell under 10 dlrs dlrs a barrel lastsummer as OPEC members increased production to gain marketshare, but have since risen to around 18 dlrs because the  OPECproduction/pricing agreement is basically in tact.    Willmon said light and medium crude oils currently supply90 pct of world oil demand yet they account for less than 25pct of remaining petroleum resources.    "So future demand increasingly will be met from the variousforms of heavy oil," Willmon said. Heavy crude oil resourcesinclude extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands andoil shales (in sedimentary rock).     Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oildevelopment economical, including real and stable growth incrude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improvedtechnology.    He said he expects "all pieces of the puzzle to fittogether." But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is verysensitive to crude oil prices. And he said the most importantfactor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of theprice of crude.    Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eightdlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive foran oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil.    He said the current price differential is only about fivedlrs a barrel.    Willmon indicated that a benchmark crude oil price above 20dlrs would be ideal. But he said currently under study are abroad range of high potential cost-effective technologies forresources recovery, transportation and upgrading of heavy oils,which would permit commercial development despite a lower crudeoil price outlook.    Willmon said these technologies included enhanced recoveryby steam injection and oil-and-water emulsion to reduce theviscocity of the heavy oils so they can flow easily through apipeline. He said such technologies may substantially reducecurrent captial investment and operating costs.    But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may notencourage new investment, that oil prices need to show ameaningful and sustained recovery.   Most of the expenses associated with heavy oils productionis fixed operating costs as in an oil sands project, ratherthan in exploration, according to Robert Smith, Senior VPOperations &lt;Syncrude Canada Ltd>.    While exploration costs for conventional crude oil rangefrom four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for syntheticcrude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location andnature of the deposit are known, according to Smith.    But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean thateverything required to build and operate the plant must comefrom outside the area.    Willmon also said, "Public policy could best help byproviding financial support to offset the high cost oftechnology developmemt which would help generate projects thatcould survive even at low oil prices for extended periods oftime."    U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said, "The ReaganAdministration is firmly committed, without equivocation, tocontinuing our efforts to improve conditions and incentives inthe marketplace that will spur oil and gas exploration anddevelopment."

The SEC's unanimous decision granting so-called unlistedtrading privileges to the 25 NASDAQ securities will allow theMidwest Exchange to begin trading the issues by May 18 under aone-year pilot program.    Unlisted trading privileges allow trading of stocks on anexchange other than the one on which the stocks are listed.    Before it would approve the Midwest Exchange request forthe unlisted trading privileges, the SEC had insisted that itand the National Association of Securities Dealers, NASD, comeup with a way of reporting and combining information on stockprices and transactions.    SEC officials said they needed to be assured that information on the trading in and price of the securities wouldbe in one place, for accuracy and consistency.    But since the exchanges still have not come with a masterplan, the SEC approved an interim plan under which NASDAQterminals would be put on the Midwest Exchange floor.    All trades in the 25 over the counter securities done onthe Midewest Exchange will be quoted in the NASDAQ system aswell as on the Midwest Exchange under the interim plan.    The NASD, Midwest Exchange and several other exchanges havesaid they are working on a master plan for consolidating thereporting of price quotes and other information on stocks nowtraded on NASDAQ and listed on one or more exchanges.    But an SEC official said such a new master reporting systemis not expected to be in place until early next year. TheMidwest Exchange proposed the interim reporting plan so that itcan begin unlisted trading immediately, he said.    The 25 securities to be traded on the Midwest Exchange arethe first over the counter securities to be traded on anyexchange besides the NASDAQ. Some issues listed on exchanges,however, are traded on the NASDAQ.    The 25 securities had an average dollar volume last year of2.4 billion dlrs and made up 18 pct of the dollar volume of allthe securities quoted on the NASD's National Market System.

The variable import fee would be dropped if oil prices riseabove 25 dlrs a barrel, sponsors of the bill said.    Revenues from the fee would be used to buy domestic oilfrom stripper wells - those that produce 10 barrels a day orless - at a fixed price of 25 dlrs a barrel. Purchases wouldstop when prices rose above that level.    "Time is running out on the domestic oil and gas industry,"Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said in a statement.

reut2-017.sgm, EGYPT FUEL PRICE INCREASES PART OF REFORM PACKAGE, Egypt has embarked on reforms sought bythe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank byraising the price of diesel oil and other types of transportfuels.    The energy price increases were the first visible measurestaken in return for IMF standby credits and World Bank loans.    Effective today, fuel oil prices were trebled and prices ofgas oil, diesel and kerosene went up by over 50 pct, anEgyptian General Petroleum Corp (EGPC) official said. He saidfuel oil will sell for 28 Egyptian pounds a ton, instead of 7.5pounds.    Kerosene and gas oil were raised by 66 pct to sell for fivepiasters a litre, while diesel rose 50 pct to 4.5 piasters.    The government is expected also to act soon, possibly asearly as next weekend, to simplify the country's complexexchange rate system, bankers said.    Moving towards a more realistic exchange rate for the poundwas part of a package of reforms sought by the IMF and creditorgovernments. In return, Egypt stands to receive up to onebillion dlrs in IMF standby credits phased over three years tohelp it repay its 38.6 billion dlr foreign debt and guaranteerescheduling by western governments, the main creditors.    Energy price increases were also a condition of progress onWorld Bank project loans of up to 800 mln dlrs in energy,communications and other sectors which have been undernegotiation for several months, western diplomats said.    The U.S. And Western Europe have pledged political backingfor President Hosni Mubarak's government, committed to amulti-party political system and peace with Israel andstrategically poised in control of the Suez Canal.    Fuel price rises, postponed at least once and likely tolead to higher retail prices of basic goods, were a test of thegovernment's resolve to pursue economic reform, diplomats said.    But the new prices are still below world market levels.    There was no announcement of increases in more politicallysensitive products such as gasoline or natural gas, used forcooking, and the mass-circulation Al-Akhbar newspaper said theywould stay the same.    Official comment was not available on speculation amongbankers and diplomats that the Central Bank would soon tinkerwith the pound's exchange rates to try to channel more dollarsinto the banking system away from the illegal but toleratedfree market.    The Central Bank was expected to set up a committee inwhich 10 commercial banks, including the four state-ownedbanks, would decide the pound's value every day.    The official "incentive rate," currently set by the CentralBank daily, is around 1.36 pounds to the dollar, against 2.15on the free market.    Bankers predicted that the banks' committee might set ratesaround 1.80 or 1.90. But some doubted this would serve the aimof curbing the free market. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, NORTH AMERICAN GAS MARKET RECOVERY YEARS AWAY, Better times for the hard hitnatural gas industry remains two to three years away as aseemingly intractable supply bubble continues to depress salesand prices, industry officials said.    An uncertain regulatory environment, disputes over Canadianpricing policies and unusually warm winters are working againsta quick recovery in the sector, a number of corporate andgovernment speakers told an energy conference here.    "We see a tough, tough short-term market, both as to priceand volume," said Michael Phelps, vice president of &lt;WestcoastTransmission Co Ltd>, a major Canadian natural gas carrier.    But Phelps predicted a fall in U.S. supply -- caused by asharp drop in exploration -- and a slight demand increaseshould help to burn off the excess supply by 1990.    As a result, Canadian gas exports to the U.S. market shouldrise to up to 1.5 trillion cubic feet a year by the end of thedecade, nearly double 1986's total.    The health of the Canadian industry is heavily dependent onthe U.S. market where nearly one third of Canada's gasproduction is sent.    Cuba Wadlington, a vice president at Northwest PipelineCorp of Salt Lake City, shared the view that markets could bein balance by 1990.    He said while North American demand for natural gas hasflattened at about 18 trillion cubic feet a year, a return tomore colder winters in the next few years could quickly tightensupplies.    "Things are clearly working towards a shrinking of thebubble," Wadlington told Reuters in an interview.    However, recent decisions by the U.S. Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission (FERC) were sharply criticized byCanadian delegates who suggested the moves could prevent thecountry from participating in the market's recovery.    The key dispute, known as the as billed issue, involves aruling last December by FERC which effectively bars U.S.pipeline companies and consumers from paying certain Canadianshipping expenses.    The Canadian government believes the ruling could severelyweaken the country's gas producers. "Besides theextra-territorial effect, there is the potential that Conadianproducers and consumers may end up subsidizing the cost oftransportation services originally incurred on behalf of U.S.customers," said Robert Skinner, an assistant deputy minister inCanada's energy department.    But FERC Chairman Martha Hesse told the conference theruling was really intended "to assure equal, fair and opencompetition in the pricing of natural gas sold within ourcountry -- whatever the source of the gas."    Hesse maintained Canadian gas was crucial to the emergenceof a freely competitive, continent-wide, energy market.    Speaking to concerns in Canada that the U.S. is seeking tolimit Canadian gas shipments, Hesse said such a move would workagainst the long-term interest of American consumers. "We trulyconstitute a North American market," she said. "Natural gasmoving through pipelines recognizes no boundries." Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING MOVING INTO DEEPER WATERS, Offshore drilling for oil and gas willbe moving into deeper and deeper waters, according to Ronald L.Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co. and president of theMarine Technology Society.     Geer told a press conference at the Offshore TechnologyConference that the technology existed to drill exploratorywells in up to 10,000 feet of water.     But he added that as the industry moves more and more tofloating systems as opposed to fixed bottom supportedstructures, the financial risks involved were greater.     He said such projects involved six to nine year timeframes, and there was a "reluctance for people to stick theirnecks too far out."     Shell holds the world record for the deepest exploratorywell, at 6,900 feet, in the Wilmington Canyon in the Atlanticoffshore New Jersey in 1984.     The company is currently drilling a 6,700 foot well in theAtwater Valley in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Louisiana.     Meanwhile, Brazil's Petrobras set a world record forunderwater production when they brought a well in 1,350 feet ofwater offshore Rio de Janeiro state into production in January.     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in theGreen Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number ofcompanies, including Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell &lt;RD>,Dupont Co's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc, USX Corp's &lt;X> Marathon Oil Co,Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> and &lt;Placid Oil Co>, are working, many ofthem testing new deep-water technologies.     Of particular interest is the controversial Penrod-72system being operated by the Dallas-based Hunt brothers wholast year placed Placid Oil under bankruptcy court protectionin order to avoid foreclosures on its valuable oil properties.     They have been seeking the right to use assets to drilloil wells in the Green Canyon through Penrod, arguing thatcontinued development of the project is essential to theirability to get out of their financial crisis.     Earlier this month, the Hunts were granted permission by abankruptcy court to pursue the Green Canyon project.     The Penrod system involves a controversial floatingproduction platform with well heads sitting 1,350 feet down onthe ocean floor. Some 24 wells will be attached to thewellhead, with one satellite well sitting in a record 1,700feet of water.     Geer said he could not comment on the Penrod project,other than to note that it involves so many new technologies,it might have a problem fitting all the pieces together withina specific time frame.     He also said he believed the potential production from theproject could be in line with what the Hunt Brothers haveprojected.     The Hunts' creditor banks have contended the Hunts haveexaggerated the potential of the project.     "They're in the ballpark," he said, of the numbers, addingthat he did not have enough information to comment further. Reuter&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, GAS GROWTH SEEN HURT BY REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY, Demand for natural gas has failed togrow in proportion to the decline in oil deliveries because ofconcerns over unresolved regulatory issues in the UnitedStates, said industry analysts and gas utility company sources.    "Natural gas is not free to compete," said Larry Makovich,director of utilities service at Data Resources Inc, "problemson pipeline open access and take-or-pay liabilities still weighheavily on end-users' decision to switch to natural gas."    A manager with an East Coast gas distribution company,agreed that reluctance among end-users often stemmed from fearof unresolved regulatory issues.    "The fact that at the federal level open access is not yetfirmly in place threatens to impede free flow of natural gasfrom producers to consumers," he said.     Michael German, an economist with the American GasAssociation, said while a significant amount of gas was nowreplacing oil in dual-fuel boilers, the progress of expandingthe marketshare of gas was slow. First quarter natural gasconsumption data is not available until June.    In the first three months of 1987, residual fuel demandfell by an average of 55,000 barrels per day, according to theAmerican Petroleum Institute. Natural gas, however, was notable to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption.    AGA's German said that while industrial consumers wereconcerned with regulatory issues in their long-range capitalinvestment decisions, in the dual-fuel boiler market relied onspot purchases.    "With all the capability of switching (from oil to naturalgas) already there, price of the fuel is the only concern," hesaid, adding that compared with the same period last year,January natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower forindustrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities.    German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gasto lower demand in the utility sector as a whole.    "March was warmer than normal, which cut down gasconsumption not only in home heating but also in electricitygeneration," he said.     In March, according to API monthly statistics, residualfuel deliveries fell by 13.6 pct to 1.2 mln barrels per dayfrom the same period a year ago.    While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas priceshad put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electricutilities and industrial users, industry analysts believed therole of natural gas was over-stated.    Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in thefuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on streamin the last few years.    Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986, and he projectedthe same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988.     In contrast, oil and gas together represented only 15 pctof the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989,he said. Within this sector, gas share fell to 66 pct in 1986from 76 pct a year ago due to competition from falling oilprices, he added. But this year, gas was expected to recaptureonly two pct of the share, Makovich said.    Michael German of AGA agreed and said, "Nevertheless,outlet for several hundred billion cubic feet of gas a year issignificant in a glutted market." Reuter&#3;

Commodore Mohammed Hoseyn Malekzadegan told a newsconference Iran was ready to maintain security in the Gulf.    But he added "If there is any disruption in the movement ofour ships and our imports and exports, this waterway would notbe left open for any country."    The radio, monitored by the British BroadcastingCorporation, quoted Malekzadegan as saying Iran's navy now hadthe most advanced defensive equipment, including long-rangeshore- to-sea missiles and a range of sea-to-sea missiles.    He said it had also expanded operations to cover the wholeregion "from the most northerly point in the Persian Gulf to themost southerly part of the Sea of Oman."    Referring to U.S. fleet movements in and near the Gulf,Malekzadegan said they had so far not been directed againstIran's interests.    "Their movements have been on the basis of internationalregulations and in the open seas," the radio quoted him assaying. "However, if any movement or action is carried outagainst the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran inwhatever context, we shall decisively confront that move." Reuter&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, DAIWA SECURITIES TO OPEN CANADIAN HOUSE, Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, of Tokyo,plans to open a new Canadian company after a June 30deregulation of the Ontario equity market is implemented, DaiwaSecurities general manager for Canada Hajimu Watanabe toldReuters in reply to query.    The Toronto Stock Exchange earlier announced Daiwa becamethe first Japanese company to acquire an exchange seat, paying361,000 Canadian dlrs, the highest price ever paid.    "This is a prelude of our establishment of a new Canadiancompany," Watanabe said.    Watanabe said Daiwa's new Canadian brokerage house willconcentrate on investment in Canadian stocks by Japaneseinvestors, Canadians acquiring Japanese equity, and governmentand corporate financing, mainly in the Canadian bond market.    "We have now a huge amount of demand on the part of Japaneseinvestors for Canadian stocks," Watanabe said.    "So if we can get membership of the Toronto Stock Exchange,that should support our business very much," he added. Daiwa'sapplication for exchange membership is subject to approval byother members and the Ontario Securities Commission.    When asked, Watanabe declined to specify how much capitalDaiwa, the world's second largest investment dealer, wouldinvest in its Canadian subsidiary.    "It is quite confidential at this moment, but say our mainintention is not to create any friction with the Canadianhouses," Watanabe said.    He said Daiwa could easily set up its new unit with onebillion Canadian dlrs of capital, "but we are starting at quitea moderate figure."    "But small means quite big in Canadian terms," he added.    Daiwa, which established a representative office in Canadain 1980, is ready to open its Canadian house as soon as Ontariosecurity deregulation is implemented on June 30, Watanabe said,adding Daiwa is very pleased with its reception by Canadianregulatory authorities.    Watanabe said about 10 pct of Japanese investment inforeign securities goes to Canada, ranking second to the UnitedStates which receives about 50 pct.    "The Japanese institutional investors feel that it is ratherrisky to concentrate around the 50 pct" in one country, he said.    Japanese institutional investors are trying to diversify toother non-American vehicles, and there are very few candidatesthat remain safe investment objects, Daiwa's Watanabe added.    Investors in Japan are also feeling it is risky toconcentrate in fixed income paper, and are looking more towardsinvestment in paper equity and real estate.   "So, investment in Canadian paper, especially Canadianequity, should have a great future," Watanabe said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, NIPPON MINING PLANS MORE U.S. JOINT VENTURES, Nippon Mining Co Ltd president YukioKasahara said the state-owned Japanese firm hoped to findadditional joint venture partners to explore for U.S. oilreserves.    "We have to secure the stability of oil for Japan,"Kasahara told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. "Inthe exploration area I think Japanese companies are interestedin joint ventures."    Nippon Mining, for example, last September signed anagreement with Dupont Co's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc to participate in a135 mln dlr exploration venture that includes six wells on landand 14 offshore Louisiana. The first joint well drilled is inthe Gulf of Mexico's Green Canyon Block 182, a deepwater leasethat Conoco was almost forced to return to the federalgovernment undrilled because of low oil prices.    "At this moment we have no success but we will proceed withConoco. Maybe by the end of the year we will find oil there,"Kasahara said. He said that similar kinds of joint ventures"would be best" for Nippon Mining's oil exploration efforts inthe future.    Kasahara also said Nippon Mining was not planning toacquire any U.S. refining or marketing outlets. "Retail salesin general do not interest the Japanese oil companies," hesaid.    When asked whether he believed world oil prices mightstrengthen later this year, Kasahara said he expected prices tohold steady at today's level.    "Within this year I think the 18 dlrs a barrel willcontinue. But next year I don't know," he said. "For therefining business, stability is important. Whether the price is18 dlrs or 20 dlrs, we don't care."    But encouraging additional upstream efforts may requiremodestly higher oil prices, Kasahara added. "For exploration Ithink 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would bereasonable," he said.    The key factor in determining whether the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr abarrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran andIraq, Kasahara said. Saudi Arabia, he added, was an uncertainelement in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintainrevenues at the same time the weakened U.S. dollar has reducedoil profits.    Nippon Mining, which like all Japanese crude buyers isbenefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar, favorscontinuing to price OPEC crude oil according to U.S. currencyregardless of the dollar-yen relationship, Kasahara said.    "I hope the dollar would strengthen eventually and continueto improve. I would prefer to see the (OPEC) pricing remain indollars," he said. Reuter&#3;

The officials also expressed doubt that such a policychange was in the works.    Mexico is the world's leading silver producer and had anoutput of about 73.9 mln troy ounces last year, according topreliminary government figures.    Peru, the world's second leading silver producer, last weeksuspended sales of the precious metal in what authorities inLima said was an effort to protect its price in an unstablemarket.    Since the decision, Peruvian officials have said they willdiscuss cooperation in the silver market with Mexican officialsin scheduled meetings.    Last week, Peruvian central bank president Leonel Figueroaand the head of the central bank of Mexico, Miguel ManceraAguayo met in Mexico City in private talks said aimed atconsolidating the upward trend of silver prices.    Mexican minister of energy and mines, Alfredo del Mazo, isalso expected to meet soon with his Peruvian counterpart,Wilfredo Huayta.    However, no Mexican decision has been made to follow thePeruvian example of suspending new silver sales, Mexicanofficials said.    One Mexican mining sector official working closely with thegovernment's production and sales policy told Reuters therehave been no changes in policy handed down by the central bank.    "The same policy that has been followed will be continued,"said the official, who asked not to be further identified.    A spokesman for the central bank said the bank had noinformation on any silver policy changes.    An energy and mines ministry spokesman and an official inthe ministry's metallurgy department also said no governmentsilver policy change had been made.

"In China, production concentrates on the domestic market,and does not depend on the international price of oil," ZhaiGuang Ming, a director of the Chinese Ministry of Petroleum,told Reuters.    Chinese oil sold within the nation's borders is priced atabout one-third the 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price establishedby the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Zhai saidin an interview at the World Petroleum Congress.    The optimism in China is in sharp contrast to the UnitedStates where weak oil prices have prompted a steep fall in thenumber of active rigs from a 1981 peak of 4,500 to only 765last week according to the latest Baker Hughes Co rig count.    At this time, China actually has more rigs in operationthan any other country in the world, said Xianglin Hou, anothermember of the 20-man Chinese delegation at the Houston meeting.    But this does not mean good news for the sagging oilfieldequipment industry in the rest of the world, said Bryan Walman,international sales manager for Reed Tool Co in Houston.    Walman said more than 90 pct of China's drilling activityis on land and under the control of the Chinese governmentwhich requires local manufacture of drilling equipment.    But U.S. and other western nations do provide equipment forChina's fledgling offshore projects as well as participate inthe actual drilling, he said.    Amoco Corp &lt;AN>, for example, has reported a discovery in1,000 feet of water in the South China Sea.    "We're encouraged," said Alfred Munk, manager of Amoco'sforeign affairs, "but we need substantial reserves before wecan do commercial production in a remote area like that."     Zhai estimated that current Chinese oil production of 130mln tonnes a year should rise to total 200 mln tonnes annuallyby the year 2,000.    Chinese crude reserves total 23.6 billion barrels, withultimate resources estimated at 69.3 billion barrels. Reuter&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, U.S. INTERIOR SECRETARY OPPOSES OIL IMPORT FEE, U.S. Interior Secretary DonaldHodel said he does not support an oil import fee as a means tostimulate domestic oil and gas production.    "I am an advocate for incentives for exploration," Hodelsaid, but added, "I do not favor an oil import fee."    "It would inject the federal government so deeply back into the process, we would never get the government out again,and I think that would be in the long term disinterest of thenation," Hodel said in an address to a group of local businessexecutives.    Earlier today, Congressmen from oil producing statesintroduced a bill that would impose a fee on oil imports.    Hodel said he supports drilling incentives, such as repealof the Windfall Profits Tax and Fuel Use Act and deregulationof natural gas.    The secretary also said oil and gas exploration offshoreCalifornia and in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge isnecessary to prevent the U.S. from becoming too dependent onforeign supplies of oil for its energy needs.    Failure to approve such exploration, Hodel said, would leadto greater U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil.    "In the next two to five years, no matter what we do today,we are very likely to find the U.S becoming 50 pct or moredependent on imports for its oil requirements," Hodel said.    If OPEC were to raise oil prices sharply, Congress wouldlikely act to have the federal government fix gasoline pricesand allocate supplies, Hodel said.    "If they allocate supplies you and I, in the sametwo-to-five year time frame, could well find ourselves sittingback in gas lines," Hodel said.    Exploration for oil and gas in offshore areas and in theArctic National Wildlife Refuge would not jeopardizeenvironmentally sensitive areas, Hodel said.

reut2-017.sgm, FTC FINDS 17 BILLION DLR COST IN OIL IMPORT FEE, An oil import fee could costconsumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-termU.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of domestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said.    The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that afive dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil importswould increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs ayear.    After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against thecosts, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee wouldhave a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year.    Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cutthe federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energyconservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil.    But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs wouldreduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domesticoil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found.    "Any attempt to increase our energy security by limitingimports will actually reduce our long-run energy security byspeeding the depletion of domestic reserves," the study said.    The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domesticpetroleum refiners' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year,increase domestic crude oil producers' profits by about 13billion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to 8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said.    Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistentlyopposed government regulation of the oil industry at the stateand federal levels.    "This study backs up my belief that government regulationand interference with competition hurt both the market andconsumers," FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement. Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, OFFSHORE OIL INDUSTRY WAITING FOR TURNAROUND, The depressed offshore oil industry isstill waiting for a turnaround despite increasing optimisimthat world oil prices have stabilized around 18 dlrs a barrel.     "The perception of a turnaround comes from the change inprices," Charles Siess Jr, vice chairman of MarathonManufacturing Co, a subsidiary of USX Corp &lt;X>, and chairman ofthe National Ocean Industries Association, said in a pressbriefing at the Offshore Technology Conference.     "From the level of industry activity, there is noturnaround," he added.     John Huff, president of Oceaneering International Inc&lt;OCER>, was slightly more optimistic. "We are through the lowpart of the cycle -- there's an increase in interest forprojects," he said, adding, "whether it comes to orders, whoknows?"     The oil industry is recovering from last year's dramaticfall in oil prices, from 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to under10 dlrs in mid-1986. Particularly hard hit were the servicecompanies that provide the oil rigs with keys products, such aspipe and tools.     Earlier in the week, Secretary the Interior Donald Hodelannounced -- at the Conference -- the government's newfive-year offshore oil and gas leasing program, proposing 38sales, including tracts in the Gulf Coast, offshore Californiaand in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.     For the most part, the industry was disappointed with theplan, with most arguing that additional areas should have beenincluded. At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel.     Environmental concerns, particularly in California, hadlobbied strenuously against offshore oil development.     "The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails totake into account the environmental performance of the oilindustry," said Bill Bradford, executive vice president ofDresser Industries &lt;DI> and president of the PetroleumEquipment Suppliers Association.     Huff quoted National Academy of Science figures showingoffshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollutionin the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct andmuniciple dumping 31 pct.     "The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reservedevelopment program," said Siess, adding that with oil importsrising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one ofnational security.     Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president ofDupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, "We are more likelyto see a five pct increase in spending this year than thewidely-forecast five pct decrease."     Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in NewOrleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln.     However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading andBates Drilling Co &lt;RB>, said the oversupply of rigs wouldcontinue for the near-term, but added demand fortechnologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s.     Much of that demand is seen coming from the move intoicreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever moreexpensive and needing five to ten years to develop.     Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deepwater tracts.     Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, asubsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell &lt;RD>, and president of theMarine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drillexploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water.     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in theGreen Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number ofcompanies, including Shell, Conoco, USX Corp's Marathon Oil Co,Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> and Placid Oil Co, are working, many ofthem testing new deep-water technologies involving floatingplatforms.

Both measures, which take effect on May 1, were approved bythe cabinet. They will be announced to the nation by Lusinchiin a televised address tonight but the text of the decrees wasreleased this afternoon.    Businessmen, who met Lusinchi, opposed the pay rise, sayingit will fuel inflation. The inflation rate was 11.5 pct in 1986and private economists say it will be 25 to 30 pct in 1987.    The central bank said first quarter inflation was 6.3 pct.    The wage increase for public and private sector employeeswill be 30 pct on salaries of up to 2,100 bolivars a month. Forsalaries of from 2,101 to 6,100 bolivars 25 pct and for thoseof 6,101 to 20,000 bolivars 20 pct.    The measures were taken in response to a request from theVenezuelan confederation CTV for an increase to offset the lossin the purchasing power of workers' salaries. It estimated theloss at 40 pct.    The general wage rise is the third granted by Lusinchisince his government took office in February 1984.    The wage increases are a bonus and will not be consideredin calculating benefits or severance pay, the decree said.    At the same time, Lusinchi declared a freeze on lay-offsand firings for the next 120 days.    The price freeze applies to a group of 120 foods and otherconsumer goods declared to be "of primary necessity."    It does not apply to prices charged by agriculturalproducers or to goods for which the price is falling.    The decree establishes fines of between 1,000 and 500,000bolivars for merchants who violate the price control measure. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, JAPAN VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE EARNS HIGH RETURNS, Companies offering variable life insurancepolicies, introduced in Japan in October, look set to reportsparkling results when they report on fund performance laterthis month, fund managers at major insurance companies said.    The managers told Reuters some insurers showed variablelife returns topping 50 pct on an annual basis in the fivemonths to March 31. Industry sources said all 17 Japanese andU.S. Insurers offering variable life policies here have earnedreturns of more than 10 pct on their investments.    Returns on variable life policies, which are paid whenpolicies are surrendered, depend on the performance of fundsrun by insurers.    Managers said strong results are due to the loading offunds into the buoyant Tokyo stock market and into convertiblebonds and attractive short-term instruments such as large yentime deposits.    Japanese share prices rose 30 pct in absolute terms betweenNovember 1 and March 31. Key bond yields fell to around fourpct from five pct in the same period.    "Variable life avails itself of the times and clients arelikely to be attracted after the impressive results to be madepublic in early June," Ichirou Hayashi, general manager ofNippon Life Insurance Co Ltd's fund management office said.    The Finance Ministry does not allow disclosure of insurancecompany figures for the year ended March 31 until early June.    Nippon Life, the largest Japanese insurer, had about 50,000investors in variable life by end-March while the three U.S.Firms which offer variable life here have a total of some 7,550investors, fund managers said.    Equitable Life Insurance Co Ltd, American Life Insurance CoLtd and Sony Prudential Life Insurance Co, which is a jointventure between Sony Corp and Prudential Life Assurance of theU.S., Are the three U.S. Insurers offering variable life here.   "Although (variable life) appears to be a short-termfinancial instrument with death benefit, its first priority isto raise as much cash value as it can over the long period,"said Ichiro Kono, managing director and chief actuary of SonyPrudential. Variable life guarantees a fixed death benefit.    "Variables are also attractive to executives of companieswho wish to receive them as retirement funds with options forsettlement in annuities," Kono said.    Nippon Life's Hayashi said sales of variable life wereshaping up well as interest rate consciousness grows.    Insurance managers said they expect variables to surviveany credit market collapse since the funds should be able toreact to interest rate fluctuations more quickly than hugegeneral insurance accounts, assuming fund managers grow moresophisticated in global fund and risk management.    Japanese life insurers have cut dividends paid to holdersof regular insurance by as much as 0.45 of a percentage pointsince April 1 due to declining domestic interest rates.    Fund managers said regular insurance funds are investedmore conservatively with decisions based on long-termstrategies. Major life insurers are expected to report hugeexchange losses, estimated at over 2,000 billion yen, onforeign investment for 1986/87, they said.    "Asset mix is more of a concept for larger funds, not forour variables, especially after the huge currency losses madein the last fiscal year," Hayashi of Nippon Life said.    Industry analysts said shifts of funds ahead of tax changesdue in October are helping boost the demand for variable life.    The government is expected to impose a 20 pct withholdingtax on interest from certain instruments including singlepremium endowment insurance, much of which is maturing now, butvariable life will be free of such a tax.    But Sony Prudential's Kono said, "A large shift of fundsfrom single premium endowment to variable life is unlikely,because investors in the former are more short-termreturn-minded, while the latter doesn't guarantee short-termcash value."    Sony Prudential and Equitable Life each have three separatevariable life accounts. Equitable's funds specialise inJapanese stocks, U.S. Stocks and money market instruments whileSony's covers bonds, stocks and general investment.    Japanese insurers have only one variable account each.    The Finance Ministry allowed sales of variable lifeendowment with terms over 10-years and whole life insurancefrom October 1 last year but allowed single premiums only onthe latter. REUTER&#3;

The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points,take effect on July 1.    This brings to 157 the number of goods on which importtaxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said.    The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington hasasked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added.    Today's announcement follows Saturday's removal of importcurbs on 170 products.

reut2-017.sgm, LATIN DEBTORS MAKE NEW PUSH FOR DEBT RELIEF, Rising interest rates andprotectionist trade policies had prompted a new push by LatinAmerican nations to win debt relief, regional foreign andfinance ministry officials said here.    Officials of the Cartagena group of 11 debtor nations methere this week to draw up new proposals in reaction to whatthey called a deteriorating world panorama, and Citicorp'sdecision to create reserves against third world loans.    (SEE ECRA FOR SPOTLIGHT HEADLINES)    "We are looking at trade, interest rates and financialflows.....In order to put forward a basis for some permanentsolutions," Mexico's public credit director Angel Gurria said.    Recent developments have led to moves for a summit of LatinAmerican presidents and debate on new solutions.    Ideas include schemes to link debt payments to trade, andproposals for stable interest rates. The latter was proposed ina letter this week from Cartagena to G-7 leaders who are due toattend a summit in Venice this month.    Another idea is to include debt under Gatt negotiations,but Cartegena ministers have yet to endorse any proposals.    Speaking earlier in New York, Uruguay's Foreign Ministerand Cartagena group chairman Enrique Iglesias said Citicorp'sdecision could discourage new lending. But it might helpCartagena's bid to have old and new debt treated separately.    The Cartagena group, which has not met at ministerial levelfor over a year, wants to repay debt contracted before the debtcrisis at the low interest rates prevailing in the 1970s. Itwould pay new loans at current market rates.    "Many countries fear that what they have gained in months ofarduous debt negotiations they can lose at a stroke with a onepoint rise in interest rates," one official here said.    "The new increase in interest rates has come precisely whenwe thought they had still not come down enough," Iglesias said.    Latin American officials are also concerned that varyinginterest spreads granted to different debtor nations couldgenerate discord, as with the Philippines' recent protest atbeing given less favourable terms than Argentina.    There has been speculation Venezuela would demand a cut inits 7/8 pct spread, but public finances director Jorge Marcanosaid here there were no plans to renegotiate terms.    This week's meeting came after three Latin Americanpresidents meeting in Montevideo called for stable interestrates on the region's 380 billion dlr foreign debt. It wascalled to review developments since the last ministerialmeeting in February 1986 and to think up new ideas.    Since the last ministerial meeting there have been someadvances, such as Mexico's growth-oriented 77 billion dlr loanand refinancing package agreed last September. But there havealso been setbacks, like Brazil's payments moratorium.    The loans expected in the Baker plan have not materializedand debtors have been forced to browbeat reluctant banks.    "We have clearly stretched the restructuring process to itslimits and and the question is now where do we go from here?" asenior Mexican foreign ministry official said.    Existing debt strategy has been based on nursing debtoreconomies back to a position where they can again service theirdebts and qualify for new loans.    But after five years of economic adjustment, Latin Americandebtors are currently unable to raise voluntary credits, withthe exception of Colombia. Only Venezuela is paying backprincipal. Most countries have no prospect of paying theirdebts in the foreseeable future.    Citicorp has made clear its decision to move three billiondlrs to reserves does not mean it is writing-off the loans.    Latin American officials here said Citicorp's move wouldprobably boost trading of discounted third world debt in thesecondary market, implicitly downvaluing the amount owed. Butthey said it might make new lending even more remote.    Discounted debt can be bought by foreign investors throughdebt-equity schemes that generate new resources for debtoreconomies. Chile and Mexico are currently front-runners in thisfield, but most Latin American officials see these schemes aslimited and no panacea for the overall problem.    Most Latin officials set greater store on building upexport income than on debt-equity schemes.    Exports hit 97.7 billion dlrs in 1984, cutting the region'sdebt service ratio to 36 pct, but they fell to 78.3 billionlast year. So, even though interest rates had dropped the ratiohardly changed.    The Cartagena group has called for the debt-trade link tobe recognized before, but has not made detailed proposals.    Officials said initiatives discussed here would besubmitted to foreign and finance ministers of the 11 nations,before IMF and World Bank annual meetings later this year. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE, The use of tariffs and quotas toreduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will dolittle to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a governmentstudy said.    In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products lesscompetitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost ofimported products that are re-exported in different forms.    "Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather thanhelp, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy," it said.    The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilkeand Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, whichclimbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shiftingcurrency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.    Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such asforeign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrialcompetitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictionson mergers, added little to the problem, it said.    "Although each industry's competitiveness affects the levelof imports and exports in that industry, in general we findthat there have been no significant industry-specific changesaffecting competitiveness that would explain the increase inthe overall trade deficit," the study said.    "To the extent any government action is needed to deal withthe trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-widephenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,"the FTC study said.    Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shiftswere the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the reportsaid it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost somedomestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.    It also said it found a "fairly direct relationship" betweenthe increased trade deficit and the influence of shiftingcurrency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domesticdemand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreignconsumer demand.    The study examined seven factors which have been commonlyblamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies andtrade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack ofinvestment in U.S. Industry, declining research and developmentin U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oilprices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.    In each case, the study found little or no evidence thatthe factor had any impact on the trade deficit. REUTER&#3;

Elections are due by November 1988, but tension within thegovernment over a Middle East peace conference has led manypolitical analysts to predict the government may fall earlier.    Bank of Israel governor Michael Bruno told a newsconference the austerity since July 1985 had balanced thenational budget for the first time in 15 years, and pushedinflation from 400 pct a year to just below 20 pct in 1986.    But Bruno warned that if politicians followed their pastpractice of lifting customs duties and increasing governmentsubsidies on basic goods in order to curry public favour duringelections, the gains of the program could be lost.    "The great success of the national unity government inexecuting the economic programme ... Depends on its ability toshow proper judgement towards economic issues also whenelections are on the horizon," Bruno said.    He blamed a 12 pct rise in real wages in 1986 for a sharpincrease in private consumption, and said higher pay washarming attempts to push inflation to under 10 pct a year.    "The lowering of inflation was one of the striking successesof 1986," Bruno said.    "It is important to note that in this area of economicstability we still have to tread a delicate path to reach anannualised inflation rate of 10 pct in the second half of thisyear," he said.

reut2-017.sgm, GERMAN PRIMARY BOND MARKET SEEN REVIVING IN JUNE, West Germany's eurobond market mayrevive in June, after two month's relative dormancy, beforedozing off for the summer, bond market sources said.    Syndicate managers said many borrowers, anticipating lowerWest German interest rates, cancelled mandates during the lasttwo-week calendar, hoping borrowing costs would decline.    Borrowers are likely to return as domestic interest rateslose downward momentum, syndicate managers said. Asupranational issue via Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozcentraleis likely today and Dresdner Bank AG could lead a new bond.    New issue volume is likely to be helped by a recentdomestic legal change which indirectly lowered costs forEuropean Community state-backed borrowers, the sources said.    A statutory change to the West German Exchange AdmissionsAct, which went into effect on May 1, allows such borrowers tofile for bourse listing without a prospectus and without anunderwriting group. This saves them the 1/2 point listing feeformerly paid to banks.    The two most recent issues for Electricite de France, ledby Deutsche Bank AG, and Bank of Greece, led by Commerzbank AG,were brought to market under the new law, managers said.    Deutsche Bank confirmed that its bond was brought out inconformance with the new law. Commerzbank had no comment.    The success of Commerzbank's Bank of Greece deal,especially for the shorter of the two tranches of five andeight years, has also encouraged syndicate managers to bringout new issues during the new calendar period.    Many borrowers might also seek to get their bonds in beforethe market enters its quiet summer phase, referred to by Germanbond dealers as the "summer hole."    But syndicate managers said there are also some factorsstanding in the way of new issues.    One negative factor is that current swap conditions formarks into dollars are not favourable.    Syndicate managers said the yield spread between domesticSchuldschein notes and mark eurobonds is now too low to makeswaps profitable for eurobond borrowers.    Low yields on domestic notes comparable to mark eurobondsmean German banks can now borrow cheaply at domestic rates.    They would charge a high premium to borrowers taking upeuromarks for swaps as banks have little incentive to take onmore expensive euromark liabilities at present.    However, some foreign borrowers might anyway borrow inmarks out of a genuine need for the currency, managers said.    Another factor which might dampen the primary market isuncertainty about the dollar. Its rise last week over 1.80marks helped send West German government bonds lower by nearlyone pfennig over the week.    If the dollar looks poised to stabilize or rise further,foreign investors in mark eurobonds could switch out of them onthe belief that gains from the mark's appreciation were ending,dealers said.    The dollar is expected to remain stable this week beforethe seven leading nations begin their economic summit in Veniceon June 8.    In May, a total of 1.1 billion marks of new mark eurobondswere launched, compared with 1.0 billion in April.

reut2-017.sgm, VENEZUELA HAS NO PLANS TO SEEK REVISED DEBT ACCORD, Venezuela has no plans to tryto renegotiate the debt rescheduling agreement it worked outwith creditor banks in February, public finance director JorgeMarcano told Reuters.    Speaking here after a meeting of the 11-nation Cartagenagroup, Marcano said he was aware of political pressure at hometo reduce debt payments but did not think such a move wouldbenefit Venezuela.    "We have no intention of revising the terms of the accord,"he said. "There would be little to gain and in fact it wouldprobably be detrimental."    Venezuela agreed with its bank advisory committee on a 14.5year rescheduling of 20.3 billion dlrs in public sector foreigndebt, with an interest rate 7/8 pct over Libor. The previousagreement, reached a year before but never implemented, was for12-1/2 years with a 1-1/8 pct spread.    In Caracas there have recently been calls to invoke theagreement's contingency clause which the government used lastyear to amend the original terms after a 40 pct drop in oilincome.    But Marcano said the bulk of payments to be made this yearare on private debts and non-rescheduled public debts.    Marcano said Venezuela, which has reduced its debt by sixbillion dlrs since 1983, should have no problems in repayingrestructured debt this year or next.    Asked whether the government felt badly treated with its7/8 pct spread when Mexico and Argentina have won a 13/16 pctmargin, Marcano said he still felt Venezuela had a good deal.    "Venezuela has restructured its debt so that most of it isbeing repaid at 7/8 pct, which I think is better than the othercountries," he said. The rescheduling accord covers some 90 pctof Venezuela's commercial bank debt, which accounts for morethan 90 pct of the total public sector external debt.    Venezuela has almost no debt outstanding to multilateralagencies.    Marcano said attempting to revise the rescheduling accord asecond time would probably hurt Venezuela's bid to restore itcredit rating and raise new loans.    He said Venezuela now obtains trade credit lines without agovernment guarantee, something that Argentina and others arejust starting to try to negotiate in their restructuringpackages.    Venezuela is currently seeking loans in Japan and WestGermany to finance steel and aluminium expansion.    According to finance minister Manuel Azpurua, a 100 mlnmark credit has been lined up for the Venalum aluminium plant.    Marcano said no mandate has yet been given for a planned100 mln dlr bond issue, although he confirmed that talks werecontinuing with Morgan Guaranty and other banks.

reut2-017.sgm, TOSHIBA FORECASTS 11 PCT RISE IN 1987/88 GROUP NET, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> expects to report agroup net profit of 38 billion yen for the year ending March31, 1988, up 11.2 pct from a year earlier, assuming an exchangerate of 140 yen to the dollar, a company official said.    Osamu Iemura, a senior vice president, told a newsconference sales are forecast at 3,500 billion yen, up 5.8 pct.The forecasts are based on expectations of improved sales ofoffice automation equipment, a recovery in semiconductor marketprices and an increase in plant exports.    Toshiba said earlier that 1986/87 group net profit fell42.5 pct from a year earlier to 34.18 billion yen, the secondconsecutive year-on-year drop. Sales fell 1.9 pct to 3,308billion yen, the first year-on-year sales drop in 21 years.    Iemura said the results reflected trade friction oversemiconductor exports to the U.S., The yen's sharp rise againstthe dollar and a drop in exports to China.    The 1986/87 foreign exchange loss totalled 145 billion yen,including parent company losses of 120 billion.    The average value of the yen against the dollar rose to 161from 221 a year earlier, he added.    Weaker prices for semiconductors and office automationequipment cut total sales 245 billion yen, Iemura said.    Group sales of telecommunication and electronic devices,accounting for 36 pct of the total, rose five pct to 1,183billion yen in 1987/88 from a year earlier, helped by goodsales of word processors, workstations, medical equipment,point-of-sales systems and exports of personal computers.    Semiconductor sales rose to 410 billion yen from 360billion a year earlier but fell short of an expected 430billion. Sales are expected to be 460 billion in 1987/88.    Office automation equipment sales rose to 650 billion yenin 1986/87 from 600 billion a year earlier, Iemura said. Salesin 1987/88 are expected to be 695 billion yen, mainly due togood sales of computers in Europe and to expectations the U.S.Will remove its 100 pct import duty on computers.    Sales of heavy electric goods, accounting for 26 pct ofsales, rose 0.2 pct from a year earlier to 868.14 billion yen.    Home electronics sales fell 10 pct to 940.64 billion yen,mainly due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar and adrop in colour television exports to China, Iemura said.    Overall 1986/87 overseas sales totalled 1,021 billion yen,down three pct from a year earlier, Iemura said.    Overseas sales of telecommunication and electronic devicesrose nine pct from a year earlier to 493.90 billion yen, helpedby a 80 pct year-on-year rise in computer and computer-relatedequipment sales.    Home appliance sales abroad fell 24 pct to 312.10 billion,mainly due to the yen's appreciation, lower sales to China, andincreased competition with newly-industrialised countries.    Toshiba reduced the number of divisions to three from fourin reaction to market changes, effective April 1.    Group sales of telecommunication and electronic devices areestimated at 1,520 billion yen in 1987/88, Iemura said.    Home appliance sales are estimated at 1,260 billion yen andheavy electric goods sales at 720 billion.    Iemura said group exports to China are expected to rise to90 billion yen in 1987/88 from 30 billion in 1986/87 due to anincrease in sales of generators.    Sales to China were down from 70 billion yen in 1985/86 dueto a sharp drop in home appliance exports, he said.    Group capital spending in 1987/88 will fall to 197 billionyen from 213.30 billion in 1986/87, Iemura said.    Of total capital spending, investment in semiconductorswill fall to 65 billion from 68 billion.    Research and development spending will rise to 217 billionyen from 201.10 billion, he said.

The poll,conducted for TV-AM breakfast television by the Harrisorganisation, put the Tories on 43 pct, Labour on 35 and thecentrist Social Democrat-Liberal Alliance on 20 pct.    If translated into parliamentary seats in a generalelection, Thatcher would enjoy an overall majority of 50.    Since the general elections were announced on May 11,Thatcher's Tories have maintained the lead.    A survey of marginal seats for The Times of London, carriedout by the MORI organisation, showed that Thatcher would sweepback in with an overall majority of l40 seats, the same marginshe enjoyed in the 1983 general elections.    The Times poll of marginal seats where Labour ischallenging a Conservative incumbent -- and which it must winin order to dislodge the Tories -- showed the Conservativeswith 42 pct, Labour with 34 and the Alliance on 23.    If the result were repeated on polling day, Labour wouldwin only a handful of the marginal seats, giving Thatcher alandslide. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, POORER CURRENT PROFITS SEEN FOR JAPAN FIRMS, Poor returns by oil refiners and utilitieswill drag down average current profits of major Japanese firmsin the year ending March 31, Wako Research Institute said.    Current profits will drop an average 13.5 pct after a 7.3pct drop in 1986/87, it said.    Oil refiners and utilities face a sharp profit fall aftertwo years of high profits due to the yen's strength, lowerworld oil prices and reduced interest rates, it said.    Sales of all firms are expected to rise 2.3 pct from theprevious year when they fell 11.9 pct from a year earlier.    The independent institute surveyed 436 firms listed in thefirst section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, excluding banks andinsurance firms. Excluding the oil refiners and utilities, Wakoforecasts that current profits will rise 3.7 pct after a 22.3pct drop in 1986/87 and a 19.5 pct drop in 1985/86.    Electric power firms and gas companies are likely to see42.5 and 31.6 pct falls in current profits respectively in1987/88 due to cuts in utility prices to recycle windfallprofits made during the yen's rise against the dollar, and dueto the recent recovery in world oil prices, the institute said.    Current profits of manufacturing industries will rise anaverage seven pct after a 29.7 pct drop in 1986/87 and a 25.0pct drop in 1985/86, Wako said.

reut2-017.sgm, GERMAN CAR FIRMS SEEN PRODUCING SOLID 1987 RESULTS, The West German car industry celebrated its100th birthday with a record-breaking 1986 performance at homeand is due to turn in another set of solid results in 1987.    But share market analysts warn it faces continued problemsfrom the strong German mark and predict increasingly aggressivecompetition in Europe from the Japanese.    On the plus side for the industry, which is West Germany'sbiggest foreign exchange earner, the analysts are confident thetechnical superiority and innovative qualities of the luxuryproducers will help them maintain a strong market profile.    Most analysts thought Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F> would dobest this year but expected Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG &lt;PSHG.F>to continue its slide because of the weak U.S. Dollar.    They were generally optimistic for Bayerische Motoren WerkeAG &lt;BMWG.F> (BMW) but some were sceptical it could match record1986 profits. Views were mixed on Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, butsome analysts took comfort from the fact that Europe's leadingcar maker had apparently put a major currency scandal behindit.    VW could be vulnerable as Japanese exporters, sufferingfrom the strength of the yen against the dollar, switched theirsales offensive from the U.S. To Europe, they said.    Analyst Joseph Rooney with brokers James Capel in London,noted the Japanese drive was coming at a time when the wholeEuropean market was expected to contract slightly.    But analysts saw most German manufacturers meeting thechallenge, even though the Japanese were now starting to focuson the up-market sector.    BMW's chairman Eberhard von Kuenheim shrugged off theJapanese drive in an interview with Wirtschaftswoche magazine."Iview the move by the Japanese into the top class with a certainequanimity. Not only are we playing on home turf, we also havetechnical superiority," he said.    The car industry benefitted last year from clarification ofdomestic rules on low-pollution cars, which meant orders putoff in 1985 were carried out the following year. Tax cutsgenerally boosted domestic demand, especially for cars.    Domestic registrations leapt by nearly 19 pct to a record2.8 mln cars. The VDA industry association says this might easeto 2.7 mln in 1987, but predicts another good year.    Looking to the future, Daimler has designated 16 billionmarks for car sector spending in the next five years. ChairmanWerner Breitschwerdt says spending is not aimed at quantity butimproving high quality technology and accessories.    Analyst Stephen Reitman with Phillips and Drew in London,said Daimler had the best earnings profile of West Germanproducers, with group profits per share rising to 80 marks from78.8 in 1986.    Analysts were more cautious about VW. Reinhard Fischer withBank in Liechtenstein (BiL) in Frankfurt saw VW's groupearnings per share falling to 35 marks in 1987 from 42 in 1986.A recent report from his bank said last year's currency losseswere a sign of mismanagement.    It stressed heavy losses from VW's Brazilian operations andits Spanish unit, SEAT.    VW's first quarter figures also highlighted problems inboth the U.S. And Brazil, analysts said.    VW reported flat first quarter earnings, except for a 39.2pct fall in U.S. Sales and Brazilian sales which dived 46.5pct.    Reitman was more optimistic than BiL about VW's 1987 groupearnings and, predicting an improvement in both Spain andBrazil, he saw an unchanged 42 marks per share, ,    He also said that VW now stood to benefit from not hedgingagainst foreign exchange fluctuations.    In a May 1 study, he wrote: "One point in VW's favour isthat its extraordinary policy of not hedging forward has meantthat it will have less far to go in adjusting to currentDM/Dollar rates than the other German manufacturers who were toa lesser or greater extent protected up to 1986."    Reitman was also reassured by the apparent end of thecurrency scandal, where allegedly faked forward contracts werenot acknowledged by VW's banks. VW fixed final losses from thefraud at 473 mln marks for which provisions were made in 1986.    VW's new Audi 80, a sporty model which German media reportssay was designed to jazz up Audi's staid "Grandpa" image,contributed significantly to VW's first quarter performance.The 80 doubled its sales against the year-ago level.    But the Audi range as a whole has suffered a huge setbackin the U.S. Because of an image problem linked to claims of"unintentional acceleration."    Von Kuenheim won't be pinned down on BMW's 1987 profits,but at a news conference he emphasised 1986 earnings were arecord high. Without referring to 1987, he added: "If profitsare less in one year or the other they will still be good."    Rooney said group profits per share, which BMW does notpublish, would rise to 62.5 marks this year. Some analysts putthe 1986 group profit at 60 marks, a figure BMW does not deny.    But Reitman was more pessimistic, predicting 50 marks pershare in 1987, and a return to 60 next year. He said: "BMW willbe the story of 1988," when it plans to launch an updatedversion of its Five series.    BMW also has a big investment programme under way and Bil'sFischer said depreciations could affect earnings. Otheranalysts pointed to possible hedging problems and Reitman noteda 2.10 marks to the dollar hedge expired this September.    Reitman said the outlook for Porsche was bearish for theyear to end-July, 1987. Porsche's 1985/86 group profits at 84marks per share fell 30 pct from the record 120 marks in1984/85 and Reitman saw 60 marks in 1986/87.    "With the U.S. Currently accounting for 63 pct of unit sales(this is expected to fall to 60 pct in the full year 1986/87)Porsche's earnings remain uncomfortably exposed to theDM/dollar relationship," he said.

reut2-017.sgm, PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX, Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later thismonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.    "I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the Philippines," Romero said in an interview.    He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position.    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground.    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research.    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether.    "There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra," Romero said. "We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root."    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop.    "In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that," hesaid.    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.    "To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,"he said.    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.    "Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value," he said.    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.    "A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space," Romerosaid. He said the government's proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.    "If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won't happen," he said.    PCA figures show about one-third of the country'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE, Crude oil prices could remain around 18dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision onoutput at its next meeting would be the critical factor, anofficial of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president ofinternational trade, said current OPEC output already appearedto be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itselffor the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what wasoriginally planned, while demand is growing more slowly thanenvisaged a few months ago," he said.    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level ofproduction in the third quarter would effectively sustain the18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally beenenvisaged might soften price levels.    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 inVienna to review its December accord on prices and output.    "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude interms of volume decisions," Lajous said.    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boostedoutput and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, isalways there as a possibility, he said.    "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. Iexpect other oil exporters have learned their lessons anddiscipline will be maintained," he said.    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long asthis remains there will be a tendency to instability in oilmarkets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during1987 if output remains under control.    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, thatincreased production was not so important as long as incomeswould not be affected by the output, were "very relevant andwelcome from such a powerful producer."

"The vote was 1,229, or 54.5 pct, against, and 1,028, or45.5 pct, for the contract. Eighty-one pct of the membershipvoted," he said.    The union representative said that the pact offered cost ofliving increases designed to keep pace with inflation, butcontained no wage increase.    The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet andprepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, hesaid.    The three locals cover about 2,600 production andmaintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley,B.C. lead-zinc mine.    Output at both sites has been shut down since theproduction and maintenance workers, along with about 600 officeand technical workers, went on strike May 9.    The two Steelworkers locals representing the office andtechnical workers have not negotiated since May 21.    The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeure, whichmeans the company may not be able to honor contracts forproducts from the smelter and mine.    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.    The union had requested a three pct wage increase in eachyear of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for athree-year contract and some loosening of the rules on jobclassifications.    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons oflead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 mileseast of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,most for processing at the Trail smelter.

"The vote was 1,229, or 54.5 pct, against, and 1,028, or45.5 pct, for the contract. Eighty-one pct of the membershipvoted," he said.     The union representative said that the pact offered costof living increases designed to keep pace with inflation, butcontained no wage increase.           The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet andprepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, hesaid.     The three locals cover about 2,600 production andmaintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley,B.C. lead-zinc mine.     Output at both sites has been shut down since theproduction and maintenance workers, along with about 600 officeand technical workers, went on strike May nine.          The two Steelworkers locals representing the office andtechnical workers have not negotiated since May 21.     The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeire, whichmeans the company may not be able to honor contracts forproducts from the smelter and mine.    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.            The union had requested a three pct wage increase in eachyear of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for athree-year contract and some loosening of the rules on jobclassifications.     The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons oflead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 mileseast of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,most for processing at the Trail smelter.

reut2-017.sgm, U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - FINANCING SURGE SEEN, U.S. corporate treasurers are expectedto race to market this week, propelled by hopes that the recentrecoveries of the Treasury market and the dollar will whetinvestors' appetities for new issues, underwriters said.    Underwriters expect to price about 2.3 billion dlrs of newdebt issues this week, including an asset-backed debt deal.    "Treasurers have been sitting on the sidelines for weeks,waiting to pounce," said an underwriter with a large WallStreet house. "They will hit the market at a fast pace as longas the dollar remains stable."    "The financing calendar is the heaviest it has been inweeks," said a trader with a small securities firm.    "And there are billions of dollars on the SEC shelf thatcan come to market at any time," he said, referring to companydebt filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Investment bankers said last week signaled a surge infinancings. New debt offerings rose to nearly 2.8 billion dlrsduring the holiday-shortened week from 2.09 billion dlrs in theprevious week, they calculated.    "And most of (last week's) issues were not even on thecalendar," an underwriter remarked.    Analysts noted that in the past few months the fixed-incomemarkets became virtually obsessed with the dollar. Thecurrency's sharp drop ignited fears that foreign investorswould shun dollar-denominated debt vehicles.    Also, many participants believed inflation would gathermomentum because of the dollar's fall. Inflation is the numberone enemy of fixed-rate investments, analysts explained.    But the dollar's recovery last week calmed worries in theTreasury and corporate bond markets over foreign investordemand and inflation. The resulting decline in yields shouldbring company treasurers to market, traders said.    Underwriters are slated to bid competitively tomorrow for250 mln dlrs of first mortgage bonds due 2017 of Georgia PowerCo, a unit of Southern Co &lt;SO>. The issue is rated Baa-1 byMoody's Investors and BBB-plus by Standard and Poor's.    This would be Georgia Power's first bond issue in the U.S.since August 1986 when it sold 250 mln dlrs of same-rated,same-maturity 10 pct bonds yielding 250 basis points more thancomparable Treasury securities.    Tomorrow will see another competitive. Syndicates will bidfor 100 mln dlrs of 30-year bonds rated A-1/A-plus of VirginiaElectric and Power Co, a unit of Dominion Resources Inc &lt;D>.    Virginia Electric last visited the domestic debt market inOctober 1986 when the utility issued 100 mln dlrs ofsame-rated, same-maturity 9-1/4 pct bonds. The bonds werepriced to yield 9.27 pct, or 141 basis points over Treasuries.    The biggest investment grade deal tentatively scheduled forpricing this week is 600 mln dlrs of securities due 1992 backedby the automobile loan receivables of Marine Midland Banks&lt;MM>. Salomon Brothers Inc will head the syndicate.    The Marine Midland issue follows last week's offering of230 mln dlrs of car loan backed debt by RepublicBank Dallas NA,a unit of RepublicBank Corp &lt;RPT>, underwriters noted.    Goldman, Sachs and Co led the group for the RepublicBankdeal. First Boston Corp and Salomon Brothers, the most activeunderwriters of asset-backed securities, were co-managers.    First Boston has dominated the asset-backed market sinceintroducing the concept of selling these securities in March1985. It has a commanding 86.1 pct share of the 12.5 billiondlr market, according to figures tabluated by First Boston.    Salomon Brothers is in second place with a market share of8.8 pct, followed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's share of 3.5pct of the market. Goldman Sachs is next with a 1.6 pct marketshare that was calculated before the RepublicBank Dallas deal.    Indeed, investment bankers say that banks will be the mostfrequent issuers of asset-backed securities this year. Thefinance arms of the U.S. automakers accounted for the bulk oflast year's offerings, with General Motors Corp's &lt;GM> GeneralMotors Acceptance Corp taking the lion's share of that.    The Marine Midland cars deal is rated a top-flight AAA byboth Moody's and Standard and Poor's because it is backed by aletter of credit by Union Bank of Switzerland.    Recently, Imperial Savings and Loan Association of SanDiego filed a registration statement with the SEC covering 100mln dlrs of credit card backed debt, underwriters noted. Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, TECHNOLOGY/SUPERCOMPUTER MARKET GETTING CROWDED, The supercomputer industry is gettingcrowded as a handful of startup companies and some hugeJapanese manufacturers compete for the right to apply the label"world's fastest machine" to their products.    Currently there are only about 250 supercomputers installedaround the world, but many believe that situation is about tochange dramatically as these highly specialized and extremelyexpensive machines move out of the research laboratories wheremost of them are found today and into commerical applications.    "It is commercial supercomputing... that holds the mostpromise for this young industry's handful of vendors," saidGary Smaby, supercomputer analyst for Piper Jaffray andHopwood.    These commercial applications, he said, could propel annualsales of supercomputers from 850 mln dlrs in 1986 to 2.4billion by 1990.    For years two companies, Cray Research Inc &lt;CYR> andControl Data Corp  &lt;CDA> were virtually the only options forcustomers seeking to buy supercomputers.    But in the last three years a number of new companies haveannounced supercomputers using some innovative technologies,and the industry finally expanded enough to hold its firstWorld Supercomputer Exhibition in Santa Clara last month.    Also in the last month two small companies, ETA Systems Inc(a subsidiary of Control Data) and Thinking Machines Corp  bothlaid claim to having the world's fastest computer and a jointventure of Honeywell Inc &lt;HON> and Japan's NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T>Honeywell-NEC Supercomputers Inc, announced its entrance intothe U.S. market.    All three are aiming at industry leader Cray Research Inc,which holds more than 60 pct of the market.    This week, Cray plans to make a joint announcement withDigital Equipment Corp, &lt;DEC> already the world's largestminicomputer maker, of some products that will work on bothcompanies' computers, expanding the market opportunities forboth supers and minis even further.    Supercomputers were initially designed only for the mostcomplex of applications, such as predicting worldwide weatherpatterns, fusion energy research or military defense andweapons design.    They are built for speed, not for standard businessfunctions such as payroll processing. The fastestsupercomputers can perform more than a billion calculations persecond, greater than the combined power of 100,000 personalcomputers.    They also carry stratospheric price tags of between one mlnto 20 mln dlrs each, which is why Cray's revenues could reach600 mln dlrs last year even though it only shipped 36 new and10 used supercomputers, a level that would spell starvation forany standard computer company.            But speakers at the supercomputer exhibition emphasizedthat a host of new applications should increase total industryshipments to 150 systems a year by the end of the decade.    Most commercial customers of supercomputers now use themachines to simulate a physical process, such as the flow ofair over an aircraft wing, in design and testing work.    But financial institutions, particularly Wall Streetbrokerage houses, are considered the next major buyers ofsupercomputers as they try to recognize changes in stocktrading patterns faster than any of their competitors.    Two firms, Goldman Sachs and Co and Morgan Stanley and Co,are now using superminicomputers, hybrid machines that arefaster than a minicomputer but cheaper than a super, to createfinancial models of the stock and bond markets.    Analysts said it is only a matter of time before actualsupercomputers are found on Wall Street.    One reason for the shift to commercial applications is thatsupercomputers are coming down in price as new technologiesprovide greater speed at lower costs than the Cray and ControlData behemoths.    Both the ETA and Thinking Machines Systems use a technologycalled parallel processing, in which a number of internalprocessors work together to solve a problem.    With such systems a problem is broken up and differentsegments are assigned to different processors. By contrast,standard computers solve a problem one instruction at a time,or sequentially.    The ETA system, the ETA 10, will eventually use as many aseight parallel processors capable of processing up to 8.32billion operations per second.    However, the first ETA 10, installed at Florida StateUniversity, has only two processors, later to be expanded tofour.  ETA president Lloyd Thorndyke said the ETA 10 representsa drastic change in architecture from parent company ControlData's Cyber system.    Priced from 5.5 mln to 22 mln dlrs, the ETA 10 containsabout 240 chips in each of its processing units, built onto aboard about the size of a standard newspaper section.    Each of these boards contains the equivalent of 1.5 milesof embedded wiring.    It took ETA about 3-1/2 years to develop its supercomputerbut Thorndyke said he expects much faster development timeframes in the futre, from both ETA and its competitors.    "We're in a leapfrog business and we just took the lastleap," he said.    Thinking Machines also claims to have the world's fastestcomputer and in some ways this is true. Its Connection MachineModel CM-2 can process 2.5 billion instructions per second, butit is a very specialized architecture only meant for certainvery specific applications.    The one mln to five mln dlr Connection Machine uses atechnology called "massive parallism." It contains 64,000processors crammed into a five foot cube. The processors allwork on a problem at once, breaking it down into minute bits.    It is an ideal tool for applications with manyunpredicatble variables, according to Brian Boyle, analyst forNovon Research Group. "The more unpredictable things are, themore the Thinking Machine will be appropriate," he said.        Reuter&#3;

Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the totalamount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since herecently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.    Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below whichthe bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.    "Even before he started operations, traders estimated themanager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnesmaximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level,and yet he appears reluctant to do so," one manufacturer said.    "We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buyup to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simplystep back," he added.    "The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of themarket at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and themarket because everyone is holding back from both buying andselling waiting to see what the manager will do next," oneprocessor said.    "As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market islikely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he isabout to alter his methods," he added.

reut2-017.sgm, FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE, The U.S. Department of Agriculture'sforecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks willalmost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not besurprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.    The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'Association and the National Union of Agricultural and CerealCooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports orend-of-season stocks.    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mlnwas not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecastin mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare forsoft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 andthe record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry ofAgriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectaresagainst 4.61 mln in 1986/87.    ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaignwill be released at the beginning of September, an ONICofficial said.    Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult toestimate at this stage, both within the European Community andto non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.    He said, however, that among countries to which Francecould increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghrebcountries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.    The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,was not out of line with estimates of the French MaizeProducers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.    Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields wereexpected to be higher, the AGPM official said.

Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition,said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices andvolumes and other terms may be rearranged.    The agreement signed in January for the months fromFebruary to June is up for renegotiation.    Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mlnbpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp&lt;XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp&lt;MOB> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> 550,000 bpd between them.    But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarterallowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift itsobligations under the contract    PIW said that that one alternative under consideration isto revert to four individual contracts rather than a collectiveagrement.    John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more ofa formality as the Saudis have each company on a separateschedule although separate agreements with the companies wouldfavor one on one negotiations and ensure that contractedliftings occur .    "The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants withinlimits as they do not want to antagonize them for the longhaul," he said.    Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likelyconcentrate on volume rather than price.    Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been notedand in April industry publications said that renegotiation werebeing sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.    Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV>, ExxonCorp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX> but is nowowned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although theex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.

reut2-017.sgm, EC EUROBOND ISSUE REMAINS UNRESOLVED - DIPLOMATS, European Community diplomats said thequestion of whether Eurobonds will fall under proposed EC rulesrequiring new securities issues in Community countries to bepreceded by a prospectus has yet to be resolved.    The U.K. Securities industry has been lobbying hard againstan EC Commission proposal, aimed at protecting investors, thatwould require publication and approval of a prospectus beforeall public offers of securities.    The proposed directive currently includes Eurobonds,although it makes an exception to the prospectus rules forissues directed exclusively at professional investors.    Diplomats said that with Britain tending towards backingWest Germany and Luxembourg in their opposition to theinclusion of Eurobonds, the question of whether they wouldremain within the scope of the directive or not was wide open.    "Everything is in the melting pot," said one diplomat whodeclined to be named.    The diplomats said Belgium has now given up attempts tohave the directive adopted by EC ministers before it hands overthe presidency of the 12-nation Community to Denmark on July 1.It was not immediately clear what priority the Danes wouldattach to getting the proposals through during their six monthtenure.    Meanwhile, discussions on the directive at working grouplevel have halted, diplomats said.    Officials of the EC Commission said it recognised that itsproposals created a conflict between the need for greaterprotection of investors, on the one hand, and for banks andother institutions to place Eurobonds quickly, on the other.    "It's a problem and we are still in the grips of internaldebate as to the right line to take," said one Commissionofficial. Eurobonds were not included in the original draftdirective, first put forward in 1981, but were brought into itsscope later at the request of a number of EC member states.    Diplomats said countries that oppose the inclusion ofEurobonds in the proposals are worried that the prospectusrequirements would prevent the thriving Eurobond market fromfunctioning as well as it does now.    "With timing so essential to the market for placing anddistribution, there's just not time to deal with thesebureaucratic hurdles," said one.    He and others said the overriding concern was that therequirements could drive the Eurobond market out of traditionalEC centres like London and Luxembourg to Switzerland, the U.S.Or Japan.    Diplomats said the Eurobond question is not the only issuethat needs to be resolved before the directive can be passed.    They said West Germany's main objection to the directive inits present form is that it considers as too stringent proposedrules laying down how much information companies issuingnon-listed securities should disclose in their prospectuses.    The proposed rules create problems for West Germany becauseits new second tier securities market has less demandingrequirements that would have to be tightened. REUTER&#3;

The company said it is evaluating the proposals from PaulBilzerian and from a third party which is active in theleveraged buyout field but which Pay N' Pak declined toidentify.    It said the Bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders toreceive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs inliquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemablepreferred stock for each common share.       Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is structured as amerger in which each holder would receive a combination of17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2pct cumulative preferred.    The company said the dividend on the preferred offered byBilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financialadvisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred wouldtrade in the public market at its liquidation value.    Dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option ofthe surviving corporation in cash or additional shares ofpreferred for the first five years, it added..       Pay N' Pak said Bilzerian's proposal is subject to aphysical inventory of merchandise at June 30. Bilzerian did notprovide details with respect to financing of his proposal,which is not subject to a financing condition.    The company said dividends on the preferred being offeredin the second proposal would be paid in additional preferred inthe first three years and the preferred would be redeemed inyears 12 and 13.    It said the second offer is contingent on the arrangementof financing, adding the party making the offer is confident ofits ability to obtain the balance of the financing.       Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is conditioned upon asatisfactory agreement with the company's management regardingits equity participation in the new company.    The second party anticipates executing a letter of intentwhen it delivers its financing commitment to the Pay N' Pakboard that would incorporate an expense reinbursement andoption arrangement, the company said.

The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp&lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 sharesof super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corpand the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.    The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf ofHarcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as asubstantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pctconvertible debentures.    The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds bymore than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available fordividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulentconveyance.    The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclosethat one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which itterms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable torepay it.    Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share tostockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced anextensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimedat thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.    British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of therecapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing itsalternatives.    British Printing said it filed the suit after consultationwith its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourtfailed to disclose the effect of the special dividend onHarcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.    British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormousincrease effective on the June eight record date for thedividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable uponconversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convertdenbentures before the record date because Harcourt may nothave enough authorized common shares to honor conversion afterthe date.    British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrsworth of debentures.    The suit also alleges that management, the board ofdirectors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme ofentrenchment through a combination of selling to First BostonSecurities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertiblevoting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchaseprogram and the manner in which its financing has beenstructured.

reut2-017.sgm, BONN SEEN REJECTING NEW GROWTH MEASURES AT SUMMIT, West Germany will stand firm at next week'seconomic summit in Venice against foreign pressure to followJapan's example of a multi-billion dlr package to stimulate theeconomy, West German officials said.    They conceded Japan's announcement last week of a 6,000billion yen plan to bolster its economy would throw thespotlight back on West Germany, which would face redoubledcalls from its partners to stimulate sluggish growth.    (See ECRA page for latest Economic Spotlights)    This view has already been voiced in Washington, whereofficials spoke at the weekend of behind-the-scenesconsultations with Chancellor Helmut Kohl with the aim ofsecuring a quick pledge to take action on the economy.    Italy's central bank governor Carlo Ciampi has alsocriticized West Germany's reluctance "to utilize its economicpotential" for expansionary policies.    But West German officials said it was virtuallyinconceivable that Kohl would make any concessions in Venicedespite a sharp economic downswing at the start of this year.    "There is just no room for manoeuvre for any economic moves,"said one official, echoing statements by both Kohl and FinanceMinister Gerhard Stoltenberg.    Stoltenberg already has problems finding the cash tofinance a series of tax cuts promised for 1990, and has saidhis budget is now stretched to the limit.    He is reluctantly letting government borrowing rise whilefederal income falls as a result of the tax cuts, which hehopes will stimulate growth and satisfy foreign critics.    "West Germany is exhausting to the furthest possible limitits fiscal scope as far as growth and employment is concerned,"Stoltenberg said last month.    But U.S. Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford saidEuropeans and the U.S. Were worried by flagging German growth.    "We and others are concerned about the continued signs ofweakness in the German economy," he said. Other U.S. Officialssaid France shared these worries.    Kohl will go to Venice only days after the publication offigures expected to show that the West German economy actuallycontracted in the first three months of 1987.    West Germany has pledged to review possible measures shouldfurther growth be endangered, but officials say they do notexpect such a review to be necessary.    Bonn says the economy rebounded in the second quarter andit predicts growth of just under two pct for the year.    West Germany's trading partners are also likely to wait inin vain for any further pump-priming from the Bundesbank.    Bundesbank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger made cleartoday the bank would keep interest rates down, but said therewere no plans for a cut in the Bundesbank's key discount rate,which, at three pct, is near historical lows.    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl also spoke over theweekend of the need for all countries to play a role on theinternational economic scene.    "We have to recognise that there are also limits to economicgrowth in a country like Germany," he said.    This stance was taken by Kohl when he outlined expectationsfor the Venice summit in an interview last week.    Referring to West Germany's program of tax cuts and its lowinterest rates, he said, "With these policies we have made asignificant contribution to growth and to a balanceddevelopment of the world economy."    Kohl expected no new initiatives from Venice, though hereckoned on confirmation of agreed policies, such as a pactmade in Paris in February which sought to stabilize the dollar.    That pact involved a pledge from the United States andJapan, respectively to cut the massive American budget deficitand to stimulate Japanese demand.    Kohl said he would remind both Washington and Tokyo ofthose promises. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY, A cut of about half a percentage pointin Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, althougheconomists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and widepremiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advancesrate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped itsrepurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.    That rate has remained in force, just holding above thefive pct official secured loans rate which governs commercialbank borrowings.    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West Germanrepo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate tothree pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered moneymarket rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loansrate on lending under its three month credit quota.    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and FinanceMinistry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said hewould follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the FinanceMinistry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billionguilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pctfor an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a differencebetween the secured loans rate which applies to lending underthe credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which addextra liquidity to the money market.    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move tofurther lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts wouldresult in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around itsparity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673guilders per 100 marks.    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a levelthat would not permit a change in the interest ratedifferential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealerssaid.    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German andDutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, hesaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflationexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest ratesin the longer term.    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,or even negative, while the latest official economic forecastspoint to a falling rate of economic growth.    "It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreementnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,"the ABN economist said.    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct inJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run totwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in thesecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buyingspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall belowfive pct.    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct inthe money market. REUTER&#3;

"They aremaking progress," a House source said about back roomnegotiations.    Despite these new notes of optimism, earlier hopes forquick agreement had been dashed when negotiators stalled.          House and Senate negotiators, working on different budgets,have been stymied over proposals for new taxes and defencespending levels. Both measures seek 18 billion dlrs in newtaxes in 1988, but the Senate proposes nearly 119 billion dlrsin taxes over a four year span, while the House calls for only57 billion dlrs over three years.

AlThough the sessions were closed to the press, UAWvice-president Donald Ephlin urged delegates in a bargainingdocument obtained by Reuters to be "willing to use creative andnon-traditional means in achieving our bargaining goals."    The document calls outsourcing of GM's production work toforeign or non-GM operations "perhaps the greatest singlethreat to the job security of our members" and urges bargainersto seek an expansion of limits on the giant automaker's abilityto outsource.    While saying that outsourcing pits "worker against worker"and the UAW "will not tolerate this practice," the documentfalls short of demanding an outright ban on the practice andinstead calls for improvements in "current provisions andrestrictions on outsourcing."    The union said its barginers must seek bans against plantand work place closings "similar to those included in our 1982and 1984 contracts."    In addition, the UAW said, "full resumption of ourtraditional wage formula is a top priority in this set ofnegotiations."

reut2-017.sgm, LITTLE REACTION TO COMEX PRICE LIMIT REMOVAL, The elimination of price limits onprecious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange inNew York appears to be having little effect on the market,analysts said.    "There is nothing apparent from the change," said WilliamO'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc."The market has not approached the old price limits and tradingis relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he added.    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs onmarket moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weakerin the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.    On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the twocontracts following spot after a volatile market in silverfutures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.    During the last week of April, silver futures traded up anddown the price limit in the back months, causing traders torush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analystssaid.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was muchconfusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.    The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firmsa total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched tradesin a timely manner.    Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in thenearby contracts amid quiet trading today.    O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEXmetals futures would add caution to trading since all contractscould move any distance.    "This is amore realistic approach because the metals marketis a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"O'Neill said.    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panicbuying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.    Reuter&#3;

"There is an investigation under way," said Bob Edmunds, theU.S. attorney in Greensboro, N.C.    Reynolds is a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Inc. ofWinston-Salem, N.C.

reut2-017.sgm, U.S. TRADE BILL VERY DANGEROUS FOR CANADA, LOBBY, A trade bill before the United StatesHouse of Representatives "is a very dangerous bill for Canadianindustry," Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman AdamZimmerman told reporters.    By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3removes protection for companies that take advantage of widelyused government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.    "Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grantrights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could bevulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language," hesaid.    The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the Houseof Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuringsubsidies that would greatly increase the size of anycountervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadianresource exports to the U.S.    Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices andU.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, hesaid. Such a method would make Canadian resource industriesvulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export taximposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumberto the U.S., Zimmerman added.    Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S.forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervailduty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.    "We represent the first victim of the move to price othercountries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,"Zimmerman said.

The first would limit the current quota system, which hasprotected EC output for seven years, only to flat products andheavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel productsinto free market competition.    The second proposal would link continuation of a quotasystem with progress toward plant closures, although less thana month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said theyhad abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily.

reut2-017.sgm, GENENTECH &lt;GENE> SETBACK VIEWED AS TEMPORARY, Genentech Inc is suffering only atemporary setback following a U.S. agency decision to withholda recommendation on its genetically-produced drug which is usedto treat heart attacks in progress, industry sources andanalysts said.    "When TPA (the drug) first came on the scene, the projectedtime scale for approval was 1990," said Sam Milstein, ascientist and industry consultant.    "So even with the new delay that has arisen, in alllikelihood the drug will be approved prior to initialprojections," he added.    Last Friday, an advisory committee at the Food and DrugAdministration, FDA, withheld a recommendation on Genentech'stissue plasminogen activator, a drug called Activase.    Athough it supported Genentech's claim that the drugdissolves blood clots, the FDA said it wanted data that showedthe treatment benefits heart-attack victims.    "We will be talking to the FDA as soon as possible to askspecifically what they are looking for," a Genentechspokeswoman said. She said the company had data that showedimprovement in the heart muscle after the drug was administeredbut had not included it in the FDA filing.     Industry analysts also said the 12 point drop in thecompany's stock to 37-1/4 was largely expected in light of thespeculative nature of the biotechnology companies whosefortunes often depend on the success of an important drug.    "In larger pharmaceutical companies each product does nothave as much overall significance. But this is very importantto Genentech," said Robert Riley, a senior consultant at ArthurD. Little Inc.    Some estimated that Genentech could see as much as 1.5billion dlrs from the drug. But with each delay, others canenter the market and catch up to Genentech's lead.    Industry sources pointed out that KabiVitrum, in analliance with Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F>, won a recommendation for itsstreptokinase drug on the same day Genentech's application wasdelayed. Streptokinase, an enzyme-based drug, is also used totreat heart attack victims.    In addition, Milstein said that Beecham Group Plc &lt;BHAM.L>has a drug called Eminase which is "the most likely competitorto TPA," and from a clinical standpoint, nearly identical.Beecham's drug has been approved for use in Germany and isawaiting approval in the U.K., he added.     Streptokinase was difficult to administer to heart attackvictims because it would dissolve before it reached the heart.Another method, which involved pumping the drug directly intothe heart through a tube, proved difficult when a heart attackwas in progress. TPA was seen as a savior since it was easierto administer and worked quickly.    But new developments have made streptokinase more effectiveand easier to administer, becoming a potential threat toGenentech's grasp on the TPA market. And if that wasn't enough,about 30 other biotech companies are quickly developing TPA inGenentech's path.     "Genentech's advantage is being first in the market," saidindustry consultant Scott King, formerly an analyst withMontgomery Securities in San Francisco.

Frederick Sparling, an official in the Department ofConsumer and Corporate Affairs, wants the share exchangenullified if shareholder approval is not obtained, Southamadded.    Southam said it believed it had acted properly and wouldvigorously defend itself in what would probably be a lengthyprocess.    Sparling's action came after a year-long investigation bythe federal corporations branch in response to minorityshareholders' complaints about the share exchange, which gaveTorstar a 22 pct stake in Southam.    Southam said at the time of the Torstar deal that the shareswap was necessary to avert a hostile takeover bid for Southamby a third party.    The company declined further comment while the case isbefore the courts. Reuter&#3;

In February, the state court had returned to stateregulators a case involving the recovery of Grand Gulf onenuclear power plant costs at the rate of 28 mln dlrs per month.These rates, some of which were deferred for future phase-in,were granted by the state regulators in September 1985 based onFederal Energy Regulatory Commission allocation of the powerplant's cost among Middle South's subsidiaries.    Middle South said one condition of the stay is the postingof a bond that is suitable to the Mississippi Supreme Court.    Middle South said the Supreme Court stay brings stability toMississippi Power and Light's situation and "removes thepossibility of MP and L's imminent insolvancy while the case isproceeding on the merits."

reut2-017.sgm, COMPUTER ASSOC. &lt;CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM, Computer Associates International Inc's800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate itsstrongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competitionfrom International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, Wall Streetanalysts said.     "IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systemssoftware," said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkinand Jenrette.    "But the combination of the two companies will clearlypresent a much stronger front," he said.    Besides IBM, "Computer Associates will be far and away themost powerful company in the field," added E.F. Hutton analystTerence Quinn.    That field is a segment of the market known as systemutilities, or software packages that boost the productivity ofa company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines thetwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms thatwill find the competition much harder than in the past.    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps asix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.    When the deal is completed sometime in August, thecompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independentsoftware vendor.    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wangtook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computerbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframecomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after themerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of sixcompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, onsales of 141.5 mln dlrs.    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largelybecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from thedark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or56 cts a share.   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 differentbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computersoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and amajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from hisjob as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer servicesunit.    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at anews conference that the merger would give computer users asingle source for a wide range of software products.    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates alsosell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroadsin the applications software market, where analysts said it hasbeen successful with accounting and banking systems.    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support andenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that thecompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He saidabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings ofcurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. Butthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not diluteComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record ofcompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05dlrs a share.    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operationsof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketingand research and development.    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said mostsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 timesper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth thepremium because of its earnings potential and customer base.    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currentlyowns 58 pct of Uccel.    The executive said the merger would not alter his target ofmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having thedeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. JusticeDepartment.    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after themerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang. Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION, Traders recently returned from West Africasay some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective actionso far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) bufferstock manager on buffer stock purchases.    One trader said some West African producers are annoyed theBuffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by theInternational Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.    So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have beentaken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,only on an intermittent basis.    They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first weekhe bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of thelimitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.    The traders recently returned from West Africa sayproducers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices sofar, noting producing countries are part of the internationalcocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.    London traders say terminal market prices would have togain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day averageindicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or referenceprice).    However, little progress has been made in that direction,and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lowerintervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.    The buffer stock manager may announce today he will bemaking purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of theagreement such action is not automatic, traders said.    Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock managerare not confined to West African producers, they observed.    A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sourcesthere saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with theintermittent buffer stock buying activities.    In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against totalpotential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.Carryover holdings from the previous International CocoaAgreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.    Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne fromFriday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271.    It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent fromthe market, prices go up, while when he declares his intentionto buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said. Reuter&#3;

"Five years of uninterrupted economic growth in Canada andthe strength of the Canadian bond and stock markets, despiterecent corrections, have led to a marked improvement in thefinancial health of most Canadian corporations," the bank said.

Mining, oil and gascompanies were not performing as well due to low commodityprices, the bank added.    Canadian corporate financial ratios are also stronger thanthose in the U.S., the bank said.

reut2-017.sgm, LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS, The elimination of limits on daily pricefluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on theCommodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effecton the market, analysts said.    "There is nothing apparent from the change," said WilliamO'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.    "The market has not approached the old price limits andtrading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he said.    On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the twocontracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copperand aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,which were severely tested by a volatile market in silverfutures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the liftingof all daily limits, effective today.    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs perounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in thenearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.    Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most backmonths, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearbycontracts amid quiet trading today.    During the last week of April, silver futures often tradedat the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, thedollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, orunlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.    As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, manyunmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.    The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrsfor failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panicbuying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.    O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits wouldadd caution to trading.    "This is a more realistic approach because the metalsmarket is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"O'Neill said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, AIRLINE ANALYSTS STUDY BRITISH AIRWAYS &lt;BAB>, Since British Airways was sold to thepublic by the British government, airline analysts have beguncovering the big carrier and giving it good reviews.    "Analysts are picking up British Airways because it's amajor airline, and because they have fewer companies to workwith after all the mergers," said Merrill Lynch analyst EdmundGreenslet. "Two years ago there were enough U.S. carriers, butnow more analysts are adding the international airlines."    Merrill Lynch, for instance, will be covering it from itsinternational offices, he said.    British Airways was sold to the public by the Conservativegovernment in February.    It has a fleet of 167 jetliners, making it the largest inEurope. A relatively small portion of revenue and traffic comesfrom intra-U.K. operations, and its predominantly long-haulroute network spans the globe.    Julius Maldutis at Salomon Brothers said he likes BritishAirways because it can quickly redeploy jets to strong marketsor away from weak ones, as it did last year in response to thesevere downturn in North Atlantic traffic after the Chernobylnuclear disaster and terrorist actions.    "Because of its diverse network, it has the ability tohedge or mitigate adverse developments in one particular area,"Maldutis said.    He said British Airways should outperform the rest of thestock market. Salomon was an underwriter for the company'spublic offering in February.    About 6.3 mln British Airways' American depositary receiptsare traded on the NYSE, and 2.8 mln ADRs on the Torontoexchange. Each ADR equals 10 ordinary shares.    Louis Marckesano at Janney Montgomery Scott said BritishAirways near-term outlook is good. "We're looking for goodtraffic growth and improved revenues," he said.    "British Airways should be riding a good wave," he said."Its fiscal year began April one, so when you think of all thetroubles it experienced in the first half of last year,especially in the North Atlantic market, you know allcamparisons should be nice."    At March 31 the carrier had total debt of 279 mln stg for adebt-to-equity ratio of 33 pct, which is very good for anairline, analysts said.    "Its balance sheet is very conservative - perhaps tooconservative for an airline - but that means it can borrow toexpand its fleet," Marckesano said.    British Airways has been a leading force of airlineliberalization in Europe, which is being gradually implementedto avoid the problems of U.S. airline deregulation, whichbrought years of unstable fares and losses.    Analysts agree a phased-in deregulation will greatlybenefit British Airways over the long run because it is thelargest European carrier.    Analysts caution that British Airways faces increasingcompetition for travelers to Europe from U.S. carriers asairline consolidation here expands route networks.    In 1983, for instance, about 69 pct of U.K.-boundpassengers transferred to European carriers after arriving atU.S. gateway airports onboard U.S. carriers.    But U.S. carriers are retaining more of their passengers,and this year about 30 pct of U.K.-bound travelers are expectedto switch to a European carrier to complete the trip, accordingto British Airways' chief executive officer, Colin Marshall.    "British Airways had a greater shot at picking up trafficwhen it was funneled to New York," said Marckesano "Now,traffic is being captured earlier by U.S. carriers as it leavesAtlanta, Dallas and other cities," said Marckesano.    He also said that British Airways' first-half results mightmislead an investor into gauging full-year results because itsfiscal year begins April one.    "Profits build in the first half. But if an investor justdoubles that figure, he'll be making a big mistake," he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET, European free market tin traders made asomewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpurdollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.    Traders said the new market would probably be a usefultrading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tininterests although European traders generally appear to bereasonably satisfied with the current "free market" systemwhich has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tintrading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want tosee how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market andwhat sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.    There is also a view among European traders that, while theproposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide anotheruseful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysiangovernment -- in the past viewed as a major player at times bythe trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.    Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption oftrading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that whilethere has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subjecta definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Courtlitigation actions have been resolved.    Spot tin prices on the European free market are currentlyaround 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouseRotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a tenyear low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as4,680 stg in December 1986.    This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME tradingceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.    LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485tonnes reached in February 1986.    Traders said the free market turned bullish during latelast year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demanddeficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predictingprices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.    However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswingin sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.    The decline accelerated as producers who had sold verylittle metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.    There was also a lack of significant demand from majorsteel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.    Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tinholdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,and the bulk of material still available is being held byMalaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress themarket with unwanted metal.    Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after theInternational Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager haltedsupport operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 membersnations of the International Tin Agreement.    The overhang of metal was reduced further by brokerShearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reportedhaving sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tinposition.    Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tinprices and movements are still expected to be largely relatedto currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demandemerges for the third quarter.    The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has madeefforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher worldprices by attempting to bring all major producers under anexport control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, twomajor producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument andapparently are continuing to offer material at discounts toconsumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.

Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior toa leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by thecompany this morning.    The company said it is evaluating both proposals.Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted ata meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of PayN' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.     Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised byShearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and "wemay add a bank to that."    "We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign," hesaid. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would beexchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.    Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,which the company did not identify, topped his offer betweennow and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected anopportunity to respond.    Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but didsay the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreementregarding management's equity participation.    Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the managementparticpation was "nominal."    Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there wasdisappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.    "We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22dlrs," said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pctcumulative preferred stock.    Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said "youhave to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid."    Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said thecompany has not made the best strategic moves over the years."They have not done the right things at the right time," hesaid, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declinedsince 1984.

reut2-017.sgm, MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS, Flooding in the Red River on theTexas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels perday of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, aTexaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.    "The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get anydivers down to assess the damage but there is some possibilitythat the pipeline could be up by the end of the week," a companysource said.    The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude andone-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.    Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service isrestored by Friday there would be little problem in restoringoil which has been lost to the flood.    "But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will bedifficult to make up without prorationing and we would not liketo proration this pipeline, if we don't have to."    The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic RichfieldCorp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/ShellGroup &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline'soperator.     Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crudeoil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose tonew highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.    July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.    Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers ofWTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.    Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipelineshutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with WestTexas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr abarrel below WTI, respectively.    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs atTexaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five daysbut that will depend on when the water level of the Red Riverrecedes. There is already evidence that the water level isdropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the areaaffecting the pipeline, Stevens said.    He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged wasunderground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoilnearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil wasapparently washed away.       The potential for environmental damage is being downplayedat this time despite the volume of oil that runs through thisline.    Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has notfound any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,which is nearby. Reuter&#3;

The spokesman also said the company has no comment onConiston Partners plan to carry out its solicitation ofconsents from shareholders to remove Allegis directors.    Coniston proposes replacing the board of directors with itsown candidates and then selling off one or more units ofAllegis. Allegis, apparently in response to takeover activity,announced a sweeping recapitalization plan, which will giveshareholders 60 dlrs per share.    Allegis shares came under pressure from institutionalselling today. The stock slipped 1-3/8 to 85-1/8 on volume ofmore than 1.6 mln shares. Traders said there was alsoarbitrage-related buying.    PaineWebber Group analyst Edward Starkman said institutionsand other long-term holders may want to cash in their gainsinstead of waiting for the company's special dividend, whichwould be taxed at a higher rate. The recapitalization issubject to shareholder and other approvals.    Starkman said he believes Coniston may still have a chanceto win the battle for control of Allegis' board room, despitethe recapitalization plan.    Coniston Partners would not comment on the recapitalizationplan.    "We said a week ago, and we say it again today that the wayto maximize value for shareholders is to see these companiestraded as independent companies," said Keith Gollust, one ofthe partners.    Allegis owns United Air Lines, Hertz rental cars, andWestin and Hilton International hotels.    Allegis' recapitalization plan does not entail the sale ofany of those businesses, which its management claims arenecessary to its travel services strategy. The recapitalizationplan would add three billion dlrs in debt to its balance sheet.    Some Wall Street analysts believe such a move could berisky since the airline, as well as other travel businesses,are dependant on the strength of the economy.    "They've become sort of a super cyclical company," Starkmansaid. The hotels and car rental business represents "nodiversification. It just makes it worse."    Traders and analysts who believe Coniston's effort may havea chance believe that Allegis management is not givingshareholders full value. After receiving the dividend,shareholders will still hold their stock. Arbitragers andanalysts valued the recapitalization in the upper 80s to 100dlrs per share.    Breakup values for the company estimated on Wall Streetexceed 110 dlrs per share. Reuter&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, BRITISH AIRWAYS &lt;BAB> SEES SMOOTH TRANSITION, British Airways is looking forward toindustry deregulation in Europe and believes it will be asmoother transition than the turmoil that followed the openingof the U.S. skies, its chief executive said.    Colin Marshall told Reuters that Europe will phase inderegulation gradually to avoid the problems created in theU.S. in the late 1970s -- fast growth, unstable fares, newcarriers that went bankrupt and ultimately years of losses foreven the largest airlines.    "In Europe we have the benefit of learning from theAmerican experience," Marshall said. "When you add that to theconservative nature of the Europeans, it amounts to an approachthat is slower and more cautious."    Airline liberalization, as it is called, must first beapproved by the transportation ministers of the EuropeanCommunity nations. This could come this month when theministers meet to take it up, Marshall said in an interviewduring a U.S. visit to talk to airline industry analysts.    "As the largest airline in Europe, and with thesophisticated computer systems we have to help us with yieldand load factors management, I think we have a very goodchance, if not the best chance, of doing well in a liberalizedsituation in Europe," Marshall said.    Airline market deregulation in Europe will open up newroutes between European countries, allow established carriersto grow and permit new airlines to begin operations.    It will also free airlines to fly more seats on any givenroute -- something that is highly regulated now -- and to basefares on market forces. Discount fares in Europe might evenbecome more widespread.    "We think liberalization will help stimulate traffic,"Marshall said.    Lower fares have been offered by British carriers sincedomestic services in Britain were deregulated in 1984, he said.But passengers taking return flights or from other countriespay higher, regulated prices.    Marshall said deregulation will spawn more Europeanairlines, possibly to be followed by a spate of mergers, as ishappening in the United States.    Two airlines, Sabena and Scandinavian Airlines System(SAS), are now discussing a merger. Their success "might openup Europe to further merger activity," he said.    This is because an SAS-Sabena merger could be a test caseto determine whether countries are willing to allow landingrights to be transferred from one carrier to another, he said. Reuter&#3;

Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in commentson a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharingprogram of the International Energy Agency.

Synar said, "the president is prepared to take militaryaction to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling totake less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare ournation for the next energy crisis."    Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilersto assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war.

It had no meeting scheduled with the other three strikinglocals, which rejected a tentative three-year contractSaturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.    Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost ofliving increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, butno wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.    The three locals represent about 2,600 production andmaintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about600 office and technical workers.    The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since thestrike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare forcemajeure, which means the company may be unable to honorcontracts for products from the smelter and mine.    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons oflead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 mileseast of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,most for processing at the Trail smelter.

reut2-017.sgm, USPCI &lt;UPC> SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID, share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), analysts said.    "The offer is inadequate," said Douglas Augenthaler, ananalyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent theneeded premium over the company's fundamental value based onearnings estimates.    USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at48-1/8, down 3/8.    USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he couldnot comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the boardwould meet to consider it.    Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcementthat same day of higher earnings expectations changed itsvalue. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceedanalysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.    At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in thelow 40s, Augenthaler said.    Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the wastemanagement concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on theannouncment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.    In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste managementbusiness holds significant growth potential. The industry hasgrown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based onearnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with KidderPeabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.    Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrstotal, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportationand energy company would both gain entry into a profitablebusiness and win cost-control benefits, he said.    "Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairlysignficant environmmental problems of its own," he said.    Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holdsa 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offerwas "grossly inadequate." Reuter&#3;

The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em>for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder EddieAntar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canadaannounced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.    Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues andprofits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into thehighly competitive New York City retail market for consumerelectronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes ofelectronics retailers have sagged.    The analysts questioned whether Houston-based EntertainmentMarketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whosepresent buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, hadthe management expertise for retailing or was merely trying todrive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.    "I have mixed feelings," said analyst Dennis Telzrow ofEppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. "On the one handit's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, doesEntertainment Marketing have the management talent to run itand will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"    "It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing," saidanalyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, aMinneapolis brokerage. "Electronics retailing is very managementconcentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management inplace."    Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing alreadyowns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it maybe trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its7-dlr-a-share offer.    Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid wasannounced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a sharein over-the- counter trading.     Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New YorkCity, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month thathis group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.    A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has takenno decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrssince they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. Hewould not comment on the new offer.    Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such asdisk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods toretailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly toconsumers by cable television.    In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profitwent to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.    Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said ina statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchaseof Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc toassist in financing the balance.    Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have toborrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout sinceCrazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the sameamount.    Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Mondayto 9.50. Reuter&#3;

In making the announcement, Security Pacific said the extra500 mln dlrs will raise its reserve for credit losses to about1.3 billion dlrs, or 2.8 pct of total loans and leasesoutstanding.    It said the amount of reserves allocated to LesserDeveloped Country (LDC) debt represents about one-third of thecompany's total LDC debt portfolio.    A spokesman said the company currently has LDC debtexposure of about 1.8 billion dlrs. The company's total loanportfolio at March 31 stood at 44.4 billion dlrs.    The Security Pacific move follows similar provisions byseveral other money center banks.    Last month Citicorp &lt;CCI> led the move by annoucing a threebillion dlr addition to its reserve to help bolster itsprotection against uncertainties in the economic world.    Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> followed with a 1.6 billion dlraddition to its credit loss reserve.    "While our LDC debt exposure is relatively small, we thinkthat the LDC debt environment has been altered significantlygiven the recent actions of other major financialinstitutions," Security Pacific chairman Richard Flamson saidin a statement.    Following its 500 mln dlr addition to the credit lossreserve, its primary capital ratio at the end of the secondquarter will be about 7.4 pct, Security Pacific said.    The company further stated that it anticipates continuingits current dividend payment at an annual rate of 1.80 dlrs pershare.    The company also stressed that it is not writing off loansto the developing world but rather, adding to its reserves willallow greater flexibility when dealing with these credits inthe future.    Security Pacific also said it intends to play a continuingrole in meeting the needs of those countries.    Security Pacific is the nation's sixth largest bank holdingcompany. Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC, The investor group that has agreed tobuy &lt;Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personalcomputer retailer public or sell it to other investors,industry analysts said.    "Now's a good time," said Joe Levy of International DataCorp. "The personal computer industry has bottomed out and ison the way up again," he said.    Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PCretailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought byan investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.    Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management andventure capital firm, would disclose the value of thetransaction.    Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 storesgenerated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners payroyalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.    Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions toComputerland. Computerland officials could not immediately bereached for comment.    E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venturecapital funds, and its past investments have included MattelInc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a moneymanager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.   Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strongupturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make keychanges if it is to fend off advances from rivals likeBusinessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shackstores. "The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,customer service and customer support," said Levy ofInternational Data.    Relations between Computerland and its franchise ownershave mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give upmanagment control of the company in 1985.

reut2-017.sgm, BOEING &lt;BA> RESHAPING DE HAVILLAND IN OWN IMAGE, Boeing Co is attempting to recreatemoney-losing de Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd in its ownimage.    But it is a process that will be complex and, because thecompany was in worse shape than expected, time-consuming,according to de Havilland president Ron Woodard.    Yet Woodard, a former Boeing executive, believes themakeover is absolutely essential to revitalize the historiccompany Boeing bought from the Canadian government a year ago.    "These are very complex, deep problems that you don't changeovernight," Woodard told Reuters in an interview as he outlinedhis vision of transforming de Havilland into a diversifiedmanufacturer and an important cog in Boeing's worldwideoperations.    "We've got to get our house in order. We've got to get lotsof Boeing (sub-contract) work in here and we've got to getBoeing's systems in here and just get to be part of theworldwide support system."    But based on de Havilland's turbulent flight path in recentyears, the task will also not be easy.    Formed in 1928 as an offshoot of the British operationstarted by Geoffrey de Havilland, the company has turned out avariety of small aircraft. During World War II it produced theunique wooden Mosquito bomber for the Allied Command.    In the postwar years that de Havilland became renownedinternationally for its rugged bush planes.    Canada's Liberal government, interested in developing deHavilland's STOL (Short Take Off and Landing) technology,acquired the firm in 1974 and poured 830 mln Canadian dlrs intoit over a dozen years, helping to develop the 50-seat Dash 7and 39-seat Dash 8 commuter aircraft.    Amid accusations of a sellout, the pro-businessConservative government sold the company to Boeing in 1986 for90 mln Canadian dlrs, or less than the price of one of Boeing's747s.    Woodard believes de Havilland, which has not made a profitsince 1982, suffered from neglect under government control. Itwas also in worse condition than anticipated, andthe company has approached Ottawa for compensation for what itbelieves were unexpected shortcomings at the plant.    "We found to our shock, to our surprise, last August we hadvery serious health and safety regulation violations," saidWoodard.    Although he would not divulge how much is being sought,Woodard said it would be in excess of the 10 mln Canadian dlrsalready spent on replacing the plant's outmoded ventilationsystem.    Yet Woodard is optimistic that once Boeing's manufacturingsystems are in place, the company can begin delivering planeson time and at a profit -- possibly within a year and a half.    "We've got a great product and if we can get everyoneheading the same way we're just going to eat the rest of theworld," Woodard predicted.    Company officials said production of the 6-mln-U.S.-dlr Dash 8 has been doubled to four a month and they hope to reachsix a month by year end.    Some 63 Dash 8s are on order and there are options for thepurchase of another 27. For the brand new "stretch" or extendedversion of the plane, 23 have been ordered and 11 are underoption.    Woodard said that while de Havilland has a commanding gripon the North American commuter market, which has been boomingunder airline deregulation, the company has only a 30 pctmarket share worldwide.    "I'd like to see us make some overseas penetrations. Thereare a lot of places now where people are starting toderegulate. I think the next big, big growth area is probablyEurope," he said.    De Havilland now has 5,500 employees, up from 4,300 whenBoeing bought the company. All manufacturing is located at itsDownsview Airport site in Toronto. Reuter&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW, U.S. District Court Judge EugeneA. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow onBurlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stopSamjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.    Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case couldbe pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeoverbattle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.    Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyersfor Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by DominionTextile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.    Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminaryinjunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer untilthe case is decided.    Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlrbuyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per sharelower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjenslast week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjensoffer.    Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman andDominion used illegally obtained confidential information aboutthe company in making their takeover attempt.     That information, Burlington said, was provided by JamesAmmeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebberGroup Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington'ssales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never todivulge inside information about the company.    Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he beganworking with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace itsmanagement," Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.    Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information fromPaineWebber, but argued the information was public informationand could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts orBurlington's public financial statements.    Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met withEdelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet withthem until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion wentpublic April 24 with their intention to take over the company.Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt atakeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board inFebruary.    Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion helddiscussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting asfinancial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke offbecause Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman anddominion with a written statement that they did not provideinside information.    Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeenwithdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairmanFrank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive andthreatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in aneffort to takeover Burlilgnton.    "The ultimate question is not the price per share or theprofit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct forthose who would takeover an American company," said burlingtonlawyer Humphrey.    Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as thelargest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be inviolation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada'slargest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plantsin Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,the lawyers said.    Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said themarket for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contendsand that Burlington has the ability to switch between lightweight and heavy weight denim production as demand and pricedictate.    Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed byBurlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bidfor Dominion. "Surely, what would have been sauce for the goosewould have been sauce for the gander," said Sidney Rosdeitcher,a Samjens lawyer. Reuter&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND, The dollar's recent signs of stabilityhave raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves untilafter the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.    "The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if thedollar has bottomed out," said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.    Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its valueagainst the yen and the mark as part of an officiallyorchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive onworld markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.    On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yenbut has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.    Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen farenough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.    The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in Marchfrom 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continuedimprovement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.    Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that iffurther progress is reported, the dollar would head back uptowards 150 yen.    "There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomedout for the medium term," added Tom Campbell of First NationalBank of Chicago.    Other factors supporting this bullish view were growingexpectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker wouldbe reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan'slarger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.    The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampenspeculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active centralbank intervention to support the dollar.    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week thatthe U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billiondlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amountsince the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.    Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's interventionvolume as "impressive".    James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,however: "the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the tradedata are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and140 yen."    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New Yorkwarned, "I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okadasaid market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline ofthe U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reactionto the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,which is likely to focus on the implementation of previouscommitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.    President Reagan said today, "economic policy decisionsmade last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group ofSeven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot beignored or forgotten."    "The commitments made at these meetings need to betranslated into action," he added in a speech, celebrating the40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear thebrunt of U.S. calls for further action.    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, "pressure will build up onGermany to take stimulative action like Japan."    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollarcould hold above 145 yen for some months it could also comeunder attack again if it seems the latest economic package isnot having much impact on Japan's economy and its tradesurplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trustbanks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollarpositons hedged against exchange losses in their foreignportfolios, while some others have started covering those shortpositions, Japanese bank dealers said.

Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 centscash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.    As previously reported, ETL moved into the market forMonier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct byFriday.    It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without ForeignInvestment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified asforeign because of its New Zealand base.    The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.    Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, thealternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said thevalue placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to thediluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.    ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptanceconditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investmentand U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.    ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that theshareholding in Monier was a long term investment.    ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd> associate havetargetted the building products sector as an area of expansionand Monier fits well with this aim, he added.    Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statementthat the independent directors of Monier intend to recommendacceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.    He also said Monier will not now proceed with theone-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results onMarch 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.    As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complexput and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder,Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice ofaccepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.    CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redlandtaking the second option, resulting in the two companiesrunning Monier as a joint venture.    CSR officials have also said they had no intention ofraising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's interventionbecame public last week. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS, Venezuela's central bank has orderedVenezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchangeoperations with brokers based outside the country, according toa copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.    The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, haseffectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela'svolatile currency market.    The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos HernandezDelfino, manager of the bank's department of internationaloperations.    The telex said the restriction on business with foreignbrokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreignexchange houses from selling dollars or other foreigncurrencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.    In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has deniedrumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls toprop up the weakening bolivar.    But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a defacto currency control. "It is definitely a control in the sensethat there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one brokerhere said.    "Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the directionis towards complete control," the broker said.    The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all hisVenezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him sincethe central bank issued the telex and followed it up withtelephone calls.    He said that before the restriction was imposed the volumeof his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrsa day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," hesaid.    The broker said he saw no logical explanation for theprohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediarybetween Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.    "We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that'sridiculous," he said. "They've been on a rampage againstforeigners."    The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's centralbank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchangebusiness outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pctreserve requirement.    In February, the central bank also prohibited trading inbolivar futures, the broker said.    "We used to have a forward market," he said. "For a smallcurrency it was miraculous."    He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current rangeof 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly runningout of foreign reserves to support the currency on the freemarket.

reut2-017.sgm, NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER, Bundesbank vice president HelmutSchlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.    With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down inMay and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that afurther cut in interest rates was needed.    The economy is picking up, after contracting by aseasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter fromthe fourth, he added. "We may have an increase in gnp startingin the second quarter," he said in an interview.    Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has beenpressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost itsimports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.    Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter wasmainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.    He estimated that economic growth for the year as a wholewould probably be between one and two pct.   "It is not a question of monetary conditions if domesticdemand does not grow strongly," he said, noting that interestrates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.    Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank moneystock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year paceof 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to sixpct target.    He said the target could still be achieved but much willdepend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavyinflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMSrevaluation, boosted domestic money supply.    "There is still a certain hope that the net inflow offoreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bitreversed," Schlesinger said.    A major reason for the inflows was the market's convictionthat the mark was headed higher. "As we can see from the market,expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark havediminished," Schlesinger said.    The recent widening of interest rate differentials, thefact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short periodand an improvement in real trade balances have all combinedtowards stabilizing the dollar, he said.    Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollarrise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.    At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.    "Central banks are always in contact about thesefluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,"Schelsinger said.    "One has to look at how it (the market) is moving," he said,adding, "It is not only our own case, it is also the Americancase."    He said that the West German export industry has been hithard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to seesome correction now. "But it wouldn't be good to have short-termfluctuations," he said. "Let us wait and see."    "It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a veryshort period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level(of rates) as such," Schlesinger said.    The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices ofsuch key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on WestGerman inflation down year.    Although there have recently been signs of inflationpicking up, he said that this was due to changes in keycommodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year wouldbe unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.    Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growthwas longer term, in that the economy was building up thepotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.    The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness oftargets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at themid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.    But he added: "I don't see any great pressure to go awayfrom it." REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS, Deregulation of Japan's oil industry couldmean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging intobigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.    They said the relaxation of controls was now under reviewby the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI).    A spokesman for a major firm said, "Deregulation would bringabout a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freercompetition, we have no choice but to accept it."    The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.    The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI itshould end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. Itshould cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct ofcurrent capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput andgasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.    They said deregulation was vital to promote morecompetition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.    "Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turnto see if we can survive cut-throat competition," said a sourceat one major Japanese oil company.    A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, "We'll have a hardtime surviving, but that's something we must go through."    "In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs forthe oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching outfurther into other lines such as real estate and travelagencies," he said.    Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltdwhich had the largest share of refined products sales in theJapanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refiningcapacity in fiscal 1986.    Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil productsin 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, aspokesman for the company said.    Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of theCouncil, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companieswithin seven refining and marketing groups to improve theefficiency of the industry.    Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely tobe streamlined further into five refining groups.    "MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups tomerge into five to build up their muscles," a source said.    A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out thepossibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industryin the event of the relaxation of oil controls.    He declined to officially confirm or deny that thePetroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures butsaid that in principal MITI would encourage a move towardsderegulation. REUTER&#3;

Officials of the foreign ministrysaid Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran andIraq, which have been at war since September 1980.

reut2-017.sgm, FOOD SURPLUSES OBSCURE CONTINUING STARVATION, Western bickering over food surpluses isobscuring the fact that starvation is now a bigger problem thanever before, a senior World Food Council official said.    Alain Vidal Naquet, head of external relations for thecouncil, told a news conference that a meeting organised by theUnited Nations body in Peking next week would try to forcegovernments to take a more serious attitude to the food crisis.    "The world is facing two crises -- poverty in developingcountries and paradoxically an overflow of food surpluses inthe northern part of the world," Naquet said.    "This is affecting dangerously the balance of theinternational economy," Naquet said.    He said it was ironic that the leaders of the western worldwould discuss food over-production during the summit in Venicenext week at the same time as the Peking meeting would bediscussing food shortages.    "Hunger is not a problem kept in mind by governments. Theurgency of the problem is hidden by the (food surplus andtrade) problems of the rich countries," he said. "There are morepeople today in the world lacking enough food than there werein 1974 (the year of the World Food Conference in Rome)."     Progress has been made in some parts of the world,especially Asia, but Naquet said that increasing foodproduction and aid from the developed world were not inthemselves the answer to the world food problem.    He said developing countries should not rely entirely onaid from developed countries and should increase cooperationamongst themselves to increase local food production andimprove distribution of existing food stocks.    More than 30 government ministers are expected to attendthe Peking meeting, including delegations from Third Worldcountries, the U.S., The Soviet Union and Europe. REUTER&#3;
reut2-017.sgm, SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES MARKET STARTS WELL, Singapore's government securitiesmarket had performed well in volume terms since its launch onMay 7 but there were constraints to further growth, bankers anddealers said.    Lawrence Yeo, director of securities trading anddistribution for Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Ltd, toldReuters there was a shortage of non-professional corporate,institutional and private investors trading in fixed incomesecurities, especially those with long term funds. The markettrades treasury bills and bonds.    Available liquid funds were still moving into traditionalinvestments because share prices were rising and returns werelow on fixed income securities, Yeo said.    He said the lack of market information and investmenteducation for potential investors were limiting factors.    Referring to the securitisation of corporate debt, he said"If the saving between a traditional bank loan and a publicoffering is not great, investors prefer to take the loanbecause it does not require the public disclosure ofinformation."    William K.K. Wong, managing director of Indosuez Asia(Singapore) Ltd, said institutional investors this year hadfocussed on the equity market rather than bonds.    Bankers and analysts said the new market would pave the wayfor the development of corporate bond issues.    The bankers said development of an active fixed incomesecurities market would encourage more private and publiccompanies to issue debt instruments.    They said they hoped the risk-free government bond yieldcurve would provide a benchmark for corporate bonds and otherdebt instruments.    Economists and bankers said the recent share offer bySembawang Maritime Ltd, which was oversubscribed 92.3 times andwhich raked in a record 6.80 billion dlrs, showed the flow ofliquidity into the share market. The previous record of 1.96billion dlrs was set in April by Avimo Singapore Ltd.    Wong said total average daily turnover of the governmentsecurities market had fallen sharply due to share issues.    He said there were at most seven active participants,mainly banks. Other financial institutions were on thesidelines because the securities market concept was new.    Wong said the recent revision of the minimum liquid assetratio to 18 pct allows banks to restructure liquid assets andinject more long term funds into the securities market.    One of the primary dealers, United Overseas Bank Ltd, hasan average daily turnover of over 100 mln dlrs but this couldrise to 300 mln on active option days, deputy manager Ho KianFah told Reuters.    Ho said major participants, besides the primary andregistered dealers, were mainly U.S. And U.K. Banks whichshowed a willingness to quote prices.    Loh Hoon Sun, general manager of the Overseas Union BankLtd, said he forsees active trading and bidding of newofferings in pre-issued business. Loh estimated OUB's averageturnover to be around 50 mln to 100 mln dlrs on active days.    Dealers said a significant factor was that the t-bill andmoney market rate yield gap had narrowed, making rates forbills more competitive with those in the money market.    Tan Mong Tong, executive director of National Discount CoLtd, told reporters the new securities market would enablebanks, statutory bodies, insurance companies to manage theirfunds more flexibly.    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) plans to issueeight to 10.5 billion dlrs of taxable instruments in the firstyear and a gross issue of 35 billion dlrs over five years.    The first issue of 300 mln dlrs worth of T-bills by the MASwas 1.9 times subscribed while the first issue of 500 mln dlrsworth of five-year bonds was three times oversubscribed. Therecent issue of 300 mln dlrs of two-year bonds received 1.17billion dlrs in applications.    The new securities market operated by MAS on an electronicbook entry system will provide new investment outlets intendedto develop Singapore's capital market, bankers said.    But the market is new and long term success and expansionwill depend on how the MAS and the primary and registereddealers stimulate activity, the bankers and analysts said.    They said it was necessary to promote liquidity becauseinvestors did not negotiate frequently enough and tended tohold on to their investments.    They advocated the establishment of a market makersassociation to help investors understand the market and itsinstruments as a lack of speculative activity limits marketturnover and supply.

reut2-017.sgm, CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET, The Philippines' first quarter growthfigures released yesterday indicated the government was likelyto achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor JoseFernandez said in an interview.    The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pctand gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarterfrom a year earlier.    "I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it(growth) short," Fernandez said.     NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in thefourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNPgrowth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.    "Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resourcesand if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume thatdomestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated andwould not be a stumbling block," Fernandez said.    "I think even before the figures came out, simply looking atkey indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,showed that the economy was on a different track from lastyear," he said.    Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in thefirst and second quarters because of the dry weather, and itcould drop off in the third quarter.    He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in themanufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.    "That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular," he said.    He said the government had met all monetary targets set forthe first quarter in consultation with the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourthtranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.    The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July orAugust to review performance in the January-June period.    He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billiondlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find theirnet repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.    "It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA(official development assistance) accounts the commercialbanking system will be requested to hold the line," he said.    It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMFdebt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.    The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.    Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos inApril 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started inOctober last year, had almost been completed.    He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding leveltouched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well."Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool," he said.    Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, "Ithink the Philippine debt stock looms large because our ownreceipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leapforward as might have been suitable."    The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.    NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the firstquarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.    Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth ofbetween six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that whilegrowth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.    Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by someeconomists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to thedollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports morecompetitive.    "By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the pesohas already substantially devalued against all of the country'strading partners," he said.    On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he wasopposed to a clause which would allow the unrestrictedrepatriation abroad of investments made during the first twoyears after the imposition of the Code.    The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, hasbeen delayed by objections from some business groups.    "I think any central bank, certainly this one after theevents of the past two or two and a half years, has to beprudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the windsand I'm not about to do that," Fernandez said.    "It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement ofcapital and earnings can be free," he said.    "We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainlywe continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our externalavailabilities simply by servicing our debts." REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, SOUTH KOREAN FIRMS FEAR LOAN CUTS MAY HURT EXPORTS, South Korean firms affected by a governmentorder to cut bank loan exposures fear the move may make theirexports less competitive, company officials said.    Last month, the government ordered 82 companies to repay 10pct of their bank borrowings by December 31. It told them toreplace the amount with new share issues or money raisedthrough convertible bonds offered on the local capital market.    Company officials said they backed the move in principlebut were worried it would raise financing costs at a time whenthe won was rising steadily against the dollar.    "We plan to export 100,000 cars this year and 200,000 nextyear and with our present production facilities we cannotproduce this amount," an official from Daewoo Motor Co Ltd, whorequested anonymity, told Reuters. "We must invest in productionfacilities to meet our target, which means we need a lot ofmoney from banks or elsewhere."    "But if we should pay back bank loans within this year, wewill face mounting financial difficulties and have less moneyto invest on a new production line, which will eventuallydiscourage our exports," he added.    The 82 companies each have bank loans exceeding 50 billionwon, representing a combined exposure of 10,052 billion won orabout 20 pct of all loans extended by South Korean banks,finance ministry officials said.    The companies must raise 1,005.2 billion won by theDecember deadline, the officials said. Of this total, the 82firms would raise some 646.5 billion won from selling part oftheir existing Seoul stock market portfolios, they said.    Another 74.1 billion would be raised by new share offeringsand 284.6 billion by convertible bond issues.    Most of the firms affected by the repayment scheme areaffiliates of large conglomerates or "chaebols."    Thirteen of the 82 are affiliates of Samsung Co Ltd, 10 areHyundai Corp associates, seven are part of the Lucky-GoldstarGroup, six are part of Daewoo Corp, four are Sunkyong Ltdaffiliates and four are part of Ssangyong Corp.    Finance ministry officials said the order was part ofgovernment efforts to absorb excessive money supply triggeredby the growing current account surplus and to increase thesupply of shares on the stock market.    "We want to mop up the excess liquidity by making companiesissue new shares and bonds, and to give banks more funds tolend to small-sized firms," one official said.    The targeted 1,005.2 billion won represents three pct ofthe M-2 money supply of 33,871 billion won at the end of 1986.    The M-2 at end-April was up 18.2 pct from a year earlier,compared with the government's 18 pct growth target for thewhole of this year, officials figures showed.    The current account swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrsin the first four months of this year from a deficit of 294 mlnin the same period last year.    "We expect the measure will help companies improve theirfinancial structure by lowering the ratio of liability," theministry official said.    A Hyundai Motor Co official, who asked not to beidentified, said, "We basically see the measure as positive, forwe can raise money in the capital market by issuing new sharesor convertible bonds which will eventually improve ourfinancial structure."    "But as far as the finance cost is concerned, issuing newshares is more expensive than borrowing from banks and we haveto pay back the loans (soon)," he added.    South Korean bank loans attract an average interest rate of11.5 pct.    "We are also concerned over the won's gradual appreciationagainst the dollar which is emerging as a threatening factor toexport-oriented firms," another company official said.    "We will come under mounting financial pressure if the woncontinues to go up," he added.    The won has risen more than 4.5 pct against the dollar thisyear after gaining 3.34 pct in 1986.    "Many firms prefer to borrow from banks rather than boostcapital by issuing shares so that they can evade new dividendpressure," a bank official said. "A firm's owners hate to seetheir holding ratio lowered by issuing shares."    "But their dependency on the banks should be correctedbecause their financial structure is already poor," he said.

reut2-017.sgm, GERMAN GNP FIGURES PUBLICATION DELAYED, Figures for first quarter 1987 WestGerman GNP will be published on June 11 after they wereprovisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the FederalStatistics Office said.    The official said there had been a delay in gatheringinformation for the data, which are expected to show that theWest German economy contracted in the period.    A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said therewas no political motivation behind publishing the figures onJune 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.    "There is no political motivation. It is a purely technicalmatter," he added.    The West German government is expected to come underpressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partnersto stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing internationaltrade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.    However, government officials have ruled out any furthertax reduction packages to supplement a major program ofstimulatory fiscal measures already underway.    Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, thewidest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in realterms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the firstquarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.     The government has confirmed that growth was negative inthe first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected tobe about two pct.    Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance tocut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,at three pct, is just above historical lows.    West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venicesummit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,is already outstripping export performance, which has sufferedfrom an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just overtwo years.    The government has pointed out that depressed exports arethe main reason for the current weakness in the economy, butsays that later in the year stronger domestic demand willcompensate for this setback.    It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just undertwo pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK, For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl isthe scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who hasplayed a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny forthe last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of themark.    President of the powerful and independent West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have hiscontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at theend of this year, government officials say.    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)    But no official announcement has yet been made, raisingeyebrows in West Germany's business community.    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in topministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now inopposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohlwould try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his ownChristian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has workedclosely and successfully with Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from PaulVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong internationalreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlookPoehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat ChancellorWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he wasFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, asChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against thedollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern ofthe Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institutionwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to preventinflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two boutsof galloping inflation this century.    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, andinflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safeto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on thedangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.    "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise thedollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for theBundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the markwould endanger the economy in West Germany," he told businessjournalists in Frankfurt recently.    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says thatPoehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.    "Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does notfocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the externaleconomy," she said.    An economist at a German bank, who declined to beidentified, said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it willcertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not sorigidly oriented towards money supply."    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been topersuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. ForPoehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was thatthe United States agreed to join efforts to stabilisecurrencies.    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currencydealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But infact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.    "This is because the markets know - or perhaps because theydon't know - what the central banks can do," Poehl says ofintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn ratesround, making a speculator's position worthless.    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalistin the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes overa glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football andplay golf.    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitutefor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.    "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amountif you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealersare very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers ofmany people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS, China will not increase sugar importssubstantially this year because of foreign exchange constraintsand large stocks, despite falling production and risingdomestic demand, traders and the official press said.    "Despite rapid increases in domestic production over thelast 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue tobe extremely serious," the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, becausefarmers could earn more from other crops and because technicaland seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.    The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop(November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a yearearlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.    The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlierfigure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New ChinaNews Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.    The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong provincefell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that thearea under sugar was dropping.    "Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate," the newspapersaid. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation ofnearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of caneis a major problem."    A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop inarea planted.    He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were weldeveloped, enabling farmers to choose crops according to themaximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.    The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast provinceof Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only70 from one mu of sugarbeet.    The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.    Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competedwith each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted infalling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.    The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, theofficial press has said.    Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes ofsugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.    The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mlntonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.    A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocksin 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to importsugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986when the central government resumed control of imports.    "As China lacked storage, much of these imports was storedin Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas," the diplomatsaid.    The trader said transporting stocks from these areas toconsumers in east and south China was a problem, particularlyas coal had priority. "How quickly they can move the sugar isone factor determining import levels," he said.    Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.    "China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about152/153 dlrs a tonne," he added. "China is not a desperate buyernow. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go intothe open market."    A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regardingimports was price.    "While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,foreign exchange restraints persist," he said.    The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about fivepct a year but "a communist government is in a much betterposition to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if theforeign exchange situation demands it."

"There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranianaccusation on the nature of the operations of the vesselsrecently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were outfishing," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.    It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri wassummoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with ForeignUndersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.    The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seizedseven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, whoconfessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.    It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullahwaterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at thehead of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.    The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured GulfArab states saying responsibility for security and stability inthe waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team wasscheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and PrimeMinister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence andoil ministers.    Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the KuwaitNews Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishingvessels by Iran was not the first.    Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwaithad sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.

reut2-017.sgm, OMAN CENTRAL BANK TO ISSUE TREASURY BILLS, Oman's central bank is expected toannounce shortly the go-ahead for a weekly offering of treasurybills to the sultanate's 22 local and foreign banks, bankingsources in Muscat said.    The central bank's board is due to approve the scheme atits next meeting on June 7 and it is likely to be explained tobanks at a meeting with general managers scheduled for June 14,the sources said.    The decision to issue short-term government paper will comeas a relief to banks in Oman which have been awash withliquidity but have few outlets for investment.    Oman's banks are allowed to swap only 40 pct of capital andreserves into foreign currencies, effectively preventing themfrom investing excess funds in eurodollar deposits where yieldsare much higher than in the domestic interbank market.    A treasury bill system would go some way to meeting banks'complaints on this score, bankers in Muscat said. Theirdissatisfaction is expected to be voiced at the June 14 meetingif the treasury bill scheme is not launched.    Bahrain introduced a weekly treasury bill tender lastDecember, offering local banks two mln dinars in 91-day billsby tender each Tuesday.    Other nations in the Gulf also offer banks short-termpaper, with the United Arab Emirates issuing certificates ofdeposit each week while Saudi Arabia offers "bankers' securitydeposit accounts."    Both the Bahrain treasury bills and Saudi Arabian depositaccounts can be used by banks in repurchase agreements toobtain short-term money market aid.

reut2-017.sgm, TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, Taiwan's central bank announced that asfrom today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of localand foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached atthe end of May.    The central bank's statement added that the measure wouldbe effective until the end of July.    Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow offoreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. Theyadded that the move, which sparked a record single day plungeof the local stock market, would limit their ability to lendforeign exchange to importers and exporters.    Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banksreached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,according to official statistics.    Last week the central bank said that from today it wouldreduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the movewas needed because of "distortions" in the foreign exchangemarket.    Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbankmarket to avoid exchange rate losses.    Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in Mayreached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9billion in April.    All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be convertedinto local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of boomingexports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct inthe year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.    In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions onremittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals toTaiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.    Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value ofthe local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs ofspeculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It hasflowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..    Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.    Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise theforeign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs oncapital outflows. The central bank has said the controls willbe dropped by the end of July or early August.    Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement causedjitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavypurchases of U.S. Dollars.

The loan will be for eight years and proceeds will be usedto refinance existing debt.    Interest will be at 12.5 basis points above the LondonInterbank Offered Rate (Libor) for the first four years, withthe margin rising to 15 basis points in the last four years. Noother fees were immediately available.    Bankers noted that CNP has faced significant financialproblems over the past year as a result of investments in areaswhich proved to be unprofitable.    Portugal is attempting to maintain its position in thepetrochemical industry and is undertaking a restructuring ofCNP, which involves the divestment of certain unprofitableassets.    Partly because of these problems, the new loan carries a"letter of support and assumption" under which the Republic wouldassume the obligations of CNP should it be unable to meet anypayments or cease to exist.    Furthermore, bankers noted that this financing covers allof CNP's existing debt, some of which was state-guaranteed butsome of which was not.    The existing loans had maturities of about seven to 10years and carried interest margins of between 3/8 and 5/8 pct.    By consolidating the loans and covering them with theRepublic's support, the borrower was able to obtain a reductionin the margins on the new loan, bankers said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, CHINA DELAYS REFORM BECAUSE OF POLITICS, ECONOMICS, China had postponed wide-ranging plans toreform its economy because of financial difficulties andpressure from powerful conservatives within the rulingCommunist Party, western diplomats said.    But they said that although the conservatives were criticalof aspects of the current open-door policy they had noalternative economic program. That meant that the strategybegun by top leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978 was likely to go on,but at a slower pace, they said.    Deng has led China's overhaul of the Stalinist economybuilt during the rule of Chairman Mao. Since Mao died in 1976living standards have risen sharply and China has become a netexporter of grain for the first time.    A western diplomat said China's leaders had beensufficiently encouraged by their success last year to order thedrawing up of plans for more reforms for 1987. These includedchanges to the country's price system.    But he said the biggest reforms had been shelved sinceeconomic problems appeared in late 1986 and the resignation ofCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang in January.    The diplomat said the most ambitious reforms would not beon the agenda for a major party meeting later this year.    The main economic reform proceeding in 1987 is a systemunder which factories sign contracts with the government. Theycan keep any profit over and above the contract amount.    "This is a modest reform, a repeat of what China did in theearly 1980s," the diplomat said.    "It is regarded as second best by the reformers who drew upthe more ambitious plans. But these are impractical in thecurrent political and economic climate," he said.    A Chinese source said that a month ago Premier Zhao Ziyangdecided the media was giving too much coverage to the driveagainst bourgeois liberalism and not enough to explaining theproposed reforms. Some of these reforms, like price increases,were very unpopular.    Zhao ordered the media to give more coverage to the reformsand why they were necessary, the source said.    One of China's top economists wrote in the People's Dailylast week, "Failure to answer people's questions about the newprices has caused great anxiety."    In March, China announced budget deficits for 1986 and1987. It has had two years of trade deficits, and capitalspending and wages are rising fast.    On the political front, the conservatives in the Party havebeen on the offensive since January when Hu resigned. Heallegedly failed to fight the growth of western democraticideas, which the Party has called bourgeois liberalism.    A nationwide drive against bourgeois liberalism has beenunder way since January in the Party and the media. The latterhas given wide coverage to those in the leadership who havewarned against the errors of all-out westernisation.    The economist said, "Although reform in any countryinevitably causes anxiety and is often risky, it has beenproved that, where reform is more daring, commodities are moreabundant and people's living standards higher."    "But in the countries that are more rigid, the market isstagnant, goods are in short supply and rationing is common," hesaid.    The diplomat said the reformers wanted to complete theirunfinished overhaul of China's pricing system.    The diplomat said the reformers wanted to make factoriesindependent of the government which would use taxes, creditsupply and other indirect means to regulate them instead ofadministrative diktat as in the past.    "But to enact such far-reaching measures they need a stableeconomy, contented workers and surpluses, to give themmanoeuvring room. These conditions do not exist now," he said.    Another diplomat said that conservatives within theleadership, though critical of some results of the reforms, hadno alternative economic strategy.    "The last eight years of opening to the outside world hasshown everyone how poor China is and how it has fallen behindother countries," the diplomat said.    "Everyone is agreed on the objective that China become amajor world power by the early 21st century," he said.    "For this, it needs a strong and modernised economy. Wherethere is disagreement is over the pace of the reforms and thedetails of some of them."    The Chinese source said the debate over the pace and extentof reforms was still going on.

reut2-017.sgm, CHINA TAKES SERIOUS VIEW OF MFA EXTENSION, China took a serious view of a Multi-FibreAgreement (MFA) protocol which it said infringed principles ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the People'sDaily overseas edition said.    It quoted a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign EconomicRelations and Trade as saying the protocol, signed on July 31last year and which extended the MFA for five years, wouldaffect international textile trade by broadening curbs in it.    Fifty major textile trading countries adopted the new MFAlast July in Geneva, limiting Third World exports of textilesto industrialised countries.    The newspaper said China signed the protocol on May 31, 10months after it was signed by other nations.    A U.S. Diplomat said the U.S. And China had had months oftalks on the issue, with the U.S. Saying that it would have tointroduce unilateral restraints if China did not sign.    He said that the new MFA pact extended controls to silk andramie in addition to existing ones on cotton and man-madefibres.    China, the world's biggest producer of ramie and a majorsilk producer, had flooded the U.S. Market the previous twoyears with goods made from both and from linen because thesethree categories were not under quota, the diplomat said.    It had become the biggest supplier by volume, though not byvalue, of textiles to the U.S., With exports in the first fivemonths of this year up by 24 pct from the same 1986 period.    He estimated total 1987 textile exports would be 15 pct upon the 1986 level.    Chinese customs figures show exports of textile yarn,fabrics, made-up articles and related products to the U.S. Incalendar 1986 as being worth 1.314 billion yuan, up from 870mln in 1985.    The diplomat said China and the U.S. Had held two rounds oftalks on drawing up a new three to five-year textile pact, toreplace the present one, due to expire at the end of 1987.    They involved discussion of overshipment of Chinesetextiles this year to the U.S. Due to counterfeit licences, aproblem the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Tradeadmitted to last week, he said, but gave no more details.

reut2-017.sgm, WORLD BANK CAN AID PHILIPPINES' LAND DEVELOPMENT, The World Bank's policies prevent it fromlending money for the transfer of land from landowners to thelandless, but it can help finance development of thePhilippines' proposed land reform program, a bank officialsaid.    "The World Bank by its established policies cannot use itsresources to finance the transfer of assets from one group toanother. Our mandate is to finance investment-relatedactivities," Rolando Arrivillaga, the bank's residentrepresentative in the Philippines, told Reuters in aninterview.    Arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by aWorld Bank mission that came in March to review the land reformprogram and which said the bank would not be able to financecompensation payments for the transfer of land.    He said the Philippine government had never asked the bankto finance land transfers, and the bank's position should notbe taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program.    "Clearly in the case of land reform the question of landtransfer by definition is transferring assets from the landedto the landless," Arrivillaga said. "However, the bank as aninstitution can finance the development aspects of the program."    "We will deal with the part of the program that deals withhow to put the land to effective use once it has beentransferred and how to make the on-farm investments that areneeded to attain the goal of improving the income level of thebeneficiaries," Arrivillaga said.    "I wouldn't be surprised if other multilateral institutionsare faced with similar constraints," he said.    President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said last week thatshe was committed to launching the program, which limits landholdings to seven hectares, by using her sweeping powers ofrule by decree before a new Congress convenes in July.    Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said the land reformprogram, estimated to cost about 44 billion pesos, would beimplemented in four phases and benefit 2.64 mln farmers.    Benigno said the first two phases would complete thetransfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as wellas the transfer of land sequestered, expropriated or foreclosedby the government and would cover 1.15 mln hectares.    But Aquino would not decree the redistribution of largesugar, banana and coconut plantations, leaving it to theCongress to work out the details, Benigno said.    Arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors, who form part of aconsultative group led by the World Bank, might be prepared tofinance the land transfers.    "I don't think there are fast and easy rules as to howinternational sources of finance would behave in a situationlike this, because land reform by its very nature requires richfinancing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitableto both the landowner and the beneficiary," he said.    Arrivillaga said the first priority for the governmentwould be to tap domestic sources of financing for the landtransfer, but external assistance could be brought in if therewere gaps.    "In such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness ofthe government is how it confronts the domestic resourcerequirement," Arrivillaga said. "Multilateral agencies by theirvery nature are lenders of last resort. It means they have tobe convinced that the government prioritises the program."    He said the World Bank had financed developmental costsunder an earlier land reform program launched by formerPresident Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, and such aid had beenchannelled through the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).    The LBP is the main implementing agency under Aquino'sprogram.    "If asked to do so again and the program is designed toimprove the standard of living of the poor then we wouldcertainly be prepared to consider (lending)," Arrivillaga said.    He said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate thecosts by presenting ten-year perspectives in a one-yearcontext.    Arrivillaga said the government could solve most of itsfinancing problems by devising effective instruments tocompensate landowners.    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said landowners arelikely to be paid 10 pct in cash and the rest in 10-year bondswith 10 pct of their face value redeemable each year.    Arrivillaga said any instruments used to compensatelandowners had to be freely tradable at near face value andadded: "The challenge is to devise a system of deferred paymentsthat is as good as cash."    He said the international financing community was watchingthe Philippine experiment with great interest.    "They are going to be an interesting model for many othercountries because they opened a dialogue on the reforms toevery sector of the population and even internationalinstitutions," he said. "I think they'll be on a very solid basewhen they make the decision to launch the reforms." REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, NEW PRIMARY MARKET RULES TO TAKE EFFECT JUNE 15, The International Primary MarketAssociation's new rules for lead managers of fixed rate dollarbonds will take effect on June 15, an IPMA official said.    The new IPMA rules require a lead manager to quote firmprices at which it will buy and sell newly issued bonds for 12months after the launch. The rules were first proposed March27.    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, said therules are not expected to have a noticeable impact on themarket because they only apply to dollar denominated bonds,which have been scarce recently.    This year, euroyen issuance has outstripped dollar bonds.    Sibson said that the rules are intended to provide greaterliquidity in the new issues market where underwriters sometimesstep away from deals they have managed if the market moves awayfrom them.    However, he noted that the IPMA rules are voluntary and theorganization has no authority to enforce them.    Sibson said that similar rules for new issues denominatedin other currencies will be put into effect later, followingconsultation with the Association of International BondDealers, another trade organization.

He said the allowable non-collateral lending limits wouldbe increased to 30 pct of each insurer's total assets from 25pct and that overseas subsidiaries will be made eligible asborrowers.    The lending limit for non-life insurers which do notsatisfy criteria for making non-collateral loans would beexpanded to three pct of total assets from one pct.    The upper limit of lending of securities by non-lifeinsurance companies, now set at five pct of each insurer'stotal assets would be abolished, the official said.    This will enable such lending by non-life insurers to beincluded in the separate category of money lending, which islimited to 55 pct of the total assets of each insurer.    Approvals for the changes, which must be given to eachinsurer on application, were expected to begin soon, possiblyas early as next week. REUTER&#3;

The final figure for 1986/87 will not be available untilnext month, but some local newspapers speculated that thecarryover could be as much as 1,000 billion yen.    The government is due to introduce a supplementary budgetduring an extarordinary parliamentary session expected to startin July. The budget will be used to finance the centralgovernment share of last Friday's emergency economic package.    That package totalled more than 6,000 billion yen,including more than 1,000 billion in tax cuts.    Government officials including Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa have previously said possible revenue sources for taxcuts include the tax revenue carryover from 1986/87 andproceeds from the sale of shares in the privatized NipponTelegraph and Telephone Corp.    The sale of 1.95 mln NTT shares in 1986/87 left about 450billion yen available for use as a revenue source for tax cuts,the sources said.

reut2-017.sgm, FEW EXPECT NEW ECONOMIC INITIATIVES IN VENICE, The Venice summit on June 8-10 is likelyto disappoint those hoping for new policies to whip up flaggingworld growth, according to officials from summit countries.    Worries over protectionist threats and the Third World debtcrisis are also unlikely to be assuaged, they added.    The talks may yield agreed statements on the militarysituation in the Gulf, co-operation in the fight against thekiller disease AIDS or on East-West relations, they said.    But most summit participants have made it clear that majornew initiatives on economic issues must not be expected.    West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in a recentinterview that "the translation of previous announcements intopolicy is more important than new declarations and commitments."    The main goal at the summit would be to strengthen existingagreements to secure steady medium term growth and avoid "thedanger of a further devaluation of the dollar" via closeco-operation on economic and financial policies, Kohl added.    Critics challenged this view. They pointed to the worryingbackground of slower growth, especially in Japan and Germany,amid fears about a pickup in inflation in the U.S. Which couldlead to higher interest rates and exacerbate the debt crisis.    The marginal impact that the major shifts in dollar, yenand mark exchange rates have had on the Japanese and Germantrade surpluses and U.S. Trade and fiscal deficits since theSeptember 1985 Plaza agreement was also a cause for concern.    Economists said the recent rise in the dollar was likely tobe quickly reversed in the absence of new commitments inVenice.    But government officials do not expect summit delegations -from the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canadaand the European Community - to go much beyond restating policygoals enshrined in the February Louvre agreement of Group ofSeven finance ministers and central bankers.    Under the agreement, aimed at halting the dollar's 20-monthdecline and at fostering balanced growth, Japan and WestGermany would work to eliminate their trade and paymentssurpluses in return for a U.S. Pledge to reduce fiscaldeficits.    A 6,000 billion yen package announced by Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone last week went some way towards that goal andappeared to have saved Japan from a widely anticipated summitattack on its economic policies, officials said.    The package, featuring government spending and tax cuts tostimulate demand, drew a cautious welcome in European capitalsbut its reception in the U.S. Was much more enthusiastic.    Treasury Secretary James Baker commented, "Of course,implementation is the key, but this is clearly forward movementtoward fulfillment by Japan of its commitments."    With Japan signalling its willingness to boost domesticdemand rather than rely on exports for growth, the U.S. Andother summit countries were now set to shift their attention toWest Germany and press Kohl for similar action, officials said.    U.S. Assistant treasury secretary David Mulford said therewas worldwide concern that German economic growth has flagged,and the U.S. Would demand that Kohl confirm a commitment thatpolicies would be reviewed if growth continued sluggish.    But West German officials said Kohl would fiercely resistany such pressure. One senior Bonn official said, "There is justno room for manoeuvre for any economic moves."    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has problems findingcash to finance tax cuts promised for 1990, and is reluctantlyletting government borrowing rise, Bonn officials said.    Citing fierce opposition by West Germany and Britain,European officials also ruled out progress on U.S. Plans for amore formal strategy for coordinating economic policies, basedon a series of economic indicators.    The U.S. Wants other Group of Seven countries to agree tohigh level consultations when the indicators, including trade,growth, interest and exchange rates, inflation and fiscaldeficits, show members are not living up to economiccommitments.  But Germany and Britain fear the plan would undermineeconomic sovereignty, and Britain also feels the proposals aretoo complicated and too rigid, officials said.    Recent developments on Third World debt, including moves bytwo of the largest U.S. Banks to set aside billions of dollarsto cover bad loans, will feature prominently in the talks.    U.S. And Japanese officials said they would seek toreactivate the Baker initiative at the summit and renew a callto commercial banks to come up with a "menu of alternatives" torestore some new bank lending to debtor countries.    Officials said there was also scope for agreement on aFranco-British plan aimed at alleviating the burden for theworld's poorest debtor countries through concessionalrescheduling of their sovereign debt at the Paris Club.    The talks would also include plans to dismantle runawayfarm subsidies all summit nations pay to guarantee the incomeof their farmers and secure a share of world markets, theysaid.    The 24 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperationand Development (OECD) last month supported a gradualdecoupling of farm production subsidies from income support forfarmers.    The U.S., Canada and Britain in particular are keen to movequickly after the OECD breakthrough, officials said.    "What we want is not for treasuries to compete as they donow. We want to see to it that our farmers will be able tocompete in international markets," Canadian Prime Minister BrianMulroney said.    The U.S. Intends to table specific proposals on the issueat GATT, the world trade body, immediately after the summit tosignal that it wants negotiations on farm trade to takeprecedence over the other trade issues included in the new GATTround of talks launched last year in Punta del Este, Uruguay.    "We won't have much tolerance for delay," U.S. AgricultureSecretary Richard Lyng said.    But European officials said they would resist such moves,making an agreement at the summit unlikely. France and other ECcountries insist that farm trade disputes be resolved as partof a wider trade settlement within GATT, they said. REUTER&#3;

The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health announced atthe third annual International Conference on Acquired ImmuneDeficiency Syndrome that Peptide T, first identified byinstitute neuro-scientist Dr. Candace Pert, "potently blocksentry of the AIDS virus into cells..."        The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has quickly approvedclinical testing of the naturally-occurring brain chemical. Thedecision  makes possible tests on AIDS victims.      Dr. Frederick Goodwin, the institute's scientificdirector, said in a joint interview with Pert, that "my gutreaction is that we are onto something."      He said that based on initial findings Peptide T may holdmore promise as a treatment for those already suffering fromAIDS, but could also have some value in the search for avaccine to prevent the spread of the disease.       A research team has found that Peptide T is capable offully reversing brain cell damage caused by AIDS under avariety of laboratory tests.    Pert said that she sent doses of Peptide T last autumn to aSwedish doctor who provided the chemical to four AIDS patients.One died, but the three survivors showed some improvement, shesaid.       Goodwin said that three major drug firms, which he declinedto identify, are anxious to win permission to produce thePeptide T substance that he said has potential for finding avaccine to safeguard against the deadly disease that hasthreatened the lives of over a million people thus far.

Sterling would have risen on the much better than expectednumber but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.    But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves nowavailable to the authorities to support the pound should curbany market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show theruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.    "We have been intervening to a very much greater extent thanwe have done hitherto," Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid at a news conference today, commenting on the news of therecord reserves rise.    He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvreaccord between leading industrial nations to stabilise thedollar, partly through direct intervention on foreignexchanges. "We have been playing a very full part ourselves," hesaid.    But market analysts see the recent upward pressure onsterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp downits rise, more in the light of local factors.    Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britainamid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears lastautumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.    U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreignbuyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields asattractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notablyequities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.    Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lowerinterest rates, as the government is expected to try to reversethe loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.    Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reservesnews, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket ofcurrencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.    "The market doesn't want to do anything because of theelection," commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.    Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts ofa rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs hadoverestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely tohave been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on theforward market.    The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount ofsterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooththe pound's sudden downturn, while some of the interventionreported in May probably occurred in April, they said.    The key three months interbank money market rates easedabout 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrendin U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reservesnews, analysts said.    Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market wasmuted as traders worried about the funding implications ofanother huge rise in reserves, they added.    Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cutfrom the current nine pct level soon after the election, solong as poll projections of another Conservative victory proveaccurate, with another half point later.    Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit SuisseBuckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might bepossible. "Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts infuture, rather than this active intervention," he predicted.    Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautionedagainst over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cutlooked likely.    A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.    "The Bank (of England) is both worried about the politicalproblem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... Andhas signalled some worry about broad money (growth)," said RobinMarshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.    He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves inthe past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into theEuropean Monetary System.    But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they didso. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, S.AFRICA EXPECTED TO UNVEIL EXPANSIONARY BUDGET, South Africa is expected to unveiltomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive yearin a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,economic analysts said.    Faced with competing demands for increased military andpolice spending and the pressing need for more funds for blackhousing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis isexpected to raise significantly the government's overallexpenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,the analysts said.    Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in statespending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for thefinancial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleasfrom the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.    "Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, butsimply raising government spending and increasing the budgetdeficit is an inflationary form of stimulation," said Rob Lee,chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.    South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjustedgrowth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year ofless than one pct.    Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled toover 30 pct.    Economists estimate that the government's spending targetwill rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted ataround 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficitbefore borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct ofGDP.    The government, having consistently overshot its ownspending targets for more than a decade, also faces acredibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in thebudget, analysts said.    "The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,"said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.    Many analysts in the private sector are now paying lessattention to the figures presented in the budget and are usingtheir own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for themoney and capital markets.    South African Mutual's Lee believes government spendingwill again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by theIMF.    "The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned," predictedone analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily awayfrom austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the pasttwo years.    The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in thepolitical situation and the onset of an economic crisistriggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll overloans to the country in September 1985.    Against a background of Western economic sanctions, fallingper capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,government officials say economic growth is the primeobjective.    But private-sector economists caution that the government'sability to promote growth by boosting state spending isconstrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on thecurrent account of the country's balance of payments.    Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on thenation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of anarrangement reached earlier this year with major internationalcreditor banks.    Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis haslittle room to manoeuvre.    Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries andbudgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office andSouth African Transport Services suggest that major taxconcessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.    Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessionsfor taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-onlyelection. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.    "This will not be a very exciting budget," commented HarrySchwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal ProgressiveFederal Party. "I do not expect any major tax cuts as all thesweets were given out before the election." REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, NEW PROBLEMS FOR WORLD BANK IN DEBT STRATEGY, The World Bank, in the throes of apainful reorganization, faces new strains because of actions byCitibank and others to set aside new Latin debt reserves,financial analysts and monetary sources said.    The monetary sources said the reorganization has causedsome bad feelings and charges that promotions and otherpersonnel actions have been based on personality rather thanability. It also had some effect in undermining the Bank's rolein the global debt strategy, the sources said.    At the center of the controversy is Bank President BarberConable, whose reorganization efforts are getting some critical review from many Bank staff members and some member-countries including the United States.    "I think if he were to do it again, he would do it verydifferently," said one source.    Conable, a former congressman from New York appointed byPresident Reagan to the senior most position at the Bank nearlya year ago, has taken the view that the Bank badly needed to bereorganized and perhaps made more streamlined.    In this he had the backing of many in the Reaganadministration who viewed the Bank as a bloated and inefficientbureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-marketsources of assistance were available.    However, the Bank had been singled out for a much greaterrole under the U.S. debt initiative proposed by TreasurySecretary James Baker.  That strategy, which called for some 20billion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and ninebillion dlrs in spending from the development banks, mostly theWorld Bank, came under profound doubt with the decision byCitibank and Chase Manhattan to set aside new reserves.    This move, heralded by some sources as a measure that givesall parties more time, frightened others, who see it as thebeginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to completeunraveling of the monetary system.    As envisioned by the latter, the next move would be forBrazil, which has delayed payments on its debts, to say it doesnot intend to pay interest for a very long period of time.    Citibank and other banks could then decide to stopfinancing the country's export credits, the funds countries useto support their daily activities, leading to an economicbreakdown.    "Within six weeks alot of countries could be out ofbusiness," said one source.    Citibank's initial step last month was to set some threebillion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loansto developing countries.  It was followed by a similar move byChase Manhattan some days later.    In the best of all worlds, the kind of cooperation that wasdemonstrated between the International Monetary Fund (IMF), themultilateral development banks, the wealthy countries andcommercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982, couldemerge again but no one is expecting that.    If anything, the negotiations have become much moreconfrontational with the debtor countries pressing for moreconcessions, arguing that they face growing politicalinstability if they are asked to do or pay more.    They are very critical of the IMF's austerity measures andthere is sympathy for their view among the developmentcommunity.    "When you hear code words like structural adjustment andtightening your belt.  What that means is that the poor peasentmaking 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs," says onesource.    He adds: "And when your hear they should have market forcesat play, that means the level of public services should drop."    It had been hoped that giving the World Bank a greater rolein the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in thedebtor countries to measures that increased already prevalentpoverty even further.   The Bank, which primarily assists countries in the buildingof roads, sewerage systems, education, and other so-calledinfrastructure, is viewed in the Third World as benefactor.   The IMF, however, which essentially forged the debt stategyfollowing the disclosure by Mexico in 1982 that it was neardefault, is considered a stern taskmaster that has littlesympathy or even understanding of poverty.    But there are doubts about how well the Baker initiativehas worked and about the World Bank's success at bringing aboutincreased growth in the Third World under the U.S. prescriptionwhich indicated that countries might grow their way out oftheir difficulty.

reut2-017.sgm, LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY, The Louvre agreement by the Group of Sevenfinance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencieshas worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at theeconomic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson said.    Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produceany major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters workremained to be done on improving the conditions for lastingworld economic growth.ü&#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth, he said.    "I think it is possible that there may be scope for afurther reduction in interest rates in Germany," he added, butstressed that he had had no indication that such a move waslikely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on "a gradual reductionof its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced"satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to heavycoordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, andhe was "content" with sterling's exchange rate.    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. Maycurrency reserves announced today he said, "we have been playinga very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to avery much greater extent than we had done hitherto."    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement mayfalter if member states did not implement the macro-economiccommitments underlying the accord.    "Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchangerate stability if countries are seen not to implement theircommitments in Paris ... In this respect." He said the U.S.Budget deficit was "very important."    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced byJapanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawsonsaid, "what is really needed in Japan is an increase inmerchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."    "There is a specific range of consumer and agriculturalgoods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which iswholly unjustified," he said.    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in "Japanbashing" at the summit especially after the economic stimulationpackage and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increaseJapanese development aid over the next three years.    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchangemembership would also help deflect criticism, he said.    He said he thought West Germany would instead come underpressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures tojack up faltering economic growth.    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bringforward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cutsscheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead withthe privatisation of German national industries.    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British planto alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries tomake progress in Venice.    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereigndebt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and WorldBank meetings in Washington earlier this year.    Lawson said he would seek "to consolidate political backingfor the plan at the Venice summit" and hoped the programme wouldbe finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and ChaseManhattan to increase sharply their Third World debtprovisions.    "First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the marketresponse has shown that banks have much less to fear from thissort of move than they felt before Citicorp," he said.    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions."They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves todetermine the appropriate size of provisions.    He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would bediscussed at the summit. "There is a consensus, which we have topush further." REUTER&#3;

ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier'sissued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposedbid.    The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealandentrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pctstake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.    Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holdsjust under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid andhad told CSR it is not a seller.    He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on itsoperations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built upa strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.    The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement withRedland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within sixmonths of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in thesame period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.    CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.    ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyonddescribing it as a long term investment.    ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which isa leader in building materials, Herbert said.    "We fit better with Monier," he said.    CSR has said that it will concentrate development on itscore businesses of sugar and building materials after its movesinto energy several years ago.    Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbertsaid: "I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has towonder if Monier is the main target."    Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said ahigher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.    Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched itsoriginal bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.    The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents onyesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreignshareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment ReviewBoard (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.    Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likelyto accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judgethe respective values of ETL and CSR shares.    ETL is the third group to become involved in a possibleacquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on apossible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but thenegotiations foundered on the price.    Share analysts said that for this reason, they did notthink ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bidalthough Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.    "Redland is still in the driving seat," said Tim Cohen of&lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier havingCSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.    Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid. REUTER&#3;

reut2-017.sgm, AFRICAN BANK OFFICIAL CONFIDENT ON LOAN REPAYMENTS, The Secretary-General of the AfricanDevelopment Bank expressed confidence in the institution'sability to handle potential problems with repayment ofdevelopment financing loans.    Koffi Dei-Anang told a news conference at the bank'sheadquarters that loan arrears were only 80 mln dlrs atpresent, a small percentage of total ADB lending which exceededone billion dlrs in 1986.    Some commercial banks have recently taken extraordinarymeasures to deal with third world lending strategies.    "We do have difficulty with repayment of loans on time,"Dei-Anang said. But he denied than any ADB loan arrears weremore than 12 months behind schedule.    "We have never had a default. We have never written off aloan," he added.    Dei-Anang said the Abidjan-based ADB will hold its annualgeneral meeting in Cairo from June 9 to June 11 and over 1,000delegates were expected to attend.    The agenda will include the approval of the bank's annualreport and accounts, but there will be no debate on the capitalincrease which is currently being voted on by the ADBgovernors.    An ADB spokeswoman said the U.S. Had voted for a 200 pctincrease in the bank's capital, but other votes were stillcoming in.    In December, an ad-hoc committee of the ADB's board ofgovernors, comprising 18 African and non-African countries,agreed that a 200 pct increase was necessary to finance a risein lending between 1987 and 1991.    If the recommendations are approved by the board, thecapital of the bank would rise from around 6.55 billion dlrs to19.66 billion dlrs.    Dei-Anang said the capital increase would help the bankimprove its borrowing capacity. "The capital increase is ineffect a passport to the capital market," he said.
