reut2-010.sgm, BIOGEN &lt;BGNF> GETS PATENT FROM EUROPEAN OFFICE, Biogen Inc said the EuropeanPatent Office granted it a patent covering certain proteinsused to produce a hepatitis B vaccine through geneticengineering techniques.    Robert Gottlieb, Biogen spokesman, said the company haslicensed the vaccine on a nonexclusive basis to &lt;Wellcome PLC>,the British pharmaceutical firm, and is discussing licensingwith other companies.    Biogen said the patent gives it the right to exclude othersfrom marketing hepatitis B vaccine in the 11 member countriesof the European Patent Convention.    Gottlieb said the company has also filed a patent in othermarkets, including the U.S. The vaccine is in clinical tests.    Patents in the biotechnology field are particularlyimportant as the company with an exclusive patent can reaplarge rewards. Recently many of the products of geneticengineering have become the target of patent lawsuits.    Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK> already sells a geneticallyengineered hepatitis B vaccine in the U.S. called RecombivaxHB. A subsidiary of &lt;SmithKline Beckman Corp>, SmithKlineBiologicals, based in Belgium, is selling a hepatitis Bvaccine, called Engerix-B, in Belgium.    A SmithKline spokesman said the vaccine has also beenformally approved in Switzerland and Luxembourg and has beenauthorized for market in a number of Far East countries.    Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection common in manyparts of Africa and southeast Asia where about five pct to 15pct of the population carry the virus. In the U.S. about200,000 new cases occur each year.    Last December the European Patent Ofice rejected Biogen'spatent for alpha-interferon, which Biogen said it will appealonce it receives a formal written opinion from the office.    Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, TALKING POINT/CONRAIL &lt;CRR>, Private investors eagerly snapped upshares of Consolidated Rail Corp, the biggest initial stockoffering in U.S. history, but some analysts warned they couldbe in a for a bumpy ride at least in the near term.    Analyst James Voytko of PaineWebber Group Inc believes someinvestors who bought at the offering price of 28 dlrs will betempted to sell. The shares climbed 3-3/8 to 31-3/8 by midday.Voytko said profit-taking pressure could become severe at the35 dlr level. Others say Conrail, a combination of previouslybankrupt railroads, has good long term potential.    "Conrail is in the best position to weather the currenttremendous price competition in the transportation industry ingeneral," said Drew Robertson, analyst at Atlantic Systems Inc,a research firm.    "It will survive and do damn well," said another analystwho declined to be identified. He noted that Conrail's freighttrains serve heavy industry including steel and autos in majorU.S. cities in the northeast U.S. and midwest.    Robertson noted that Conrail's traffic is less dependent oncoal than other railroads based in the east. He expects Conrailto earn 2.85 dlrs per share in 1987.    Voytko of PaineWebber sees another problem six months downthe road when more than 10 mln Conrail shares will bedistributed to current and former employees. He believes manyof these indivdiuals will be inclined to sell the stock.    Robertson says it's hard to determine the psychology of theaverage employe, but even if a lot of stock is sold, it wouldwould not hit the market as one big block. He doubts it wouldcreate a big downward push on the price.    "It's hard to call," said the analyst who requestedanonymity. In some cases employe loyalty may motivateindividuals to keep their shares, he said.    Steven Lewins, analyst for Citicorp Investment Management,believes the key to Conrail's long term outlook is how it isable to invest surplus cash. He expects Conrail to earn 3.00dlrs per share this year, flat in comparison with 1986, but by1991 the picture could change dramatically if money not neededfor rail operations is invested wisely.    By 1991, earnings could reach 4.30 dlrs per share, Lewinssaid, factoring in reinvestment of free cash flow atconservative rates.    He believes motor freight will be one area ofdiversification Conrail will explore.    Elizabeth Dole, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, whosedepartment was responsible for the sale of Conrail, noted thatConrail is required to reinvest in its rail system and cannotdefer necessary maintenance.    For the historic offering of Conrail shares, Dole visitedthe New York Stock Exchange and was photographed on the floorwearing a locomotive engineer's cap, which she presented toStanley Crane, Conrail chairman and chief executive.    The U.S. government is expected to receive about 1.88billion dlrs for Conrail after factoring in underwriting feesand other adjustments.    The possibility of a recession at some time in the nextfive years is another issue troubling some investors.    Lewins says revenue-ton-miles, which he believes will climbfrom 68.7 mln miles last year to 69.5 mln this year and 70.5mln in 1988, will grow to 71.5 mln in 1991, but in a recessionyear, perhaps 1989, the figure could dip to 64.2 mln.    On the revenue side, he believes revenue per ton-mile willbe 4.7 cts in 1991, little changed from present levels andexactly the same as in 1981.    "Their basic business isn't going anywhere," he says,explaining why emphasizes investment of cash flow.    Voytko thinks Conrail can remain profitable in a recessionyear. He points out his firm, PaineWebber, is not forecasting arecession in any specific year, but as an example a 1990recession of modest degree could knock earnings down to 2.20dlrs per share. He estimated 3.00 dlrs per share this year and3.35 dlrs next year. His 1988 figure reflects mostly a loweringof the tax rate to 34 pct from 40 pct this year.    Voytko believes the Conrail shares merit purchase at the 26dlr level.    Goldman, Sachs and Co was lead manager for the offering. Atotal of 148 firms took part in the U.S. syndicate. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, POLAND FIRM ON ECONOMY DESPITE CONCESSIONS, The Polish government has backed downfrom some proposed price rises in the face of strong oppositionfrom trade unions, but has restated its commitment to economicreforms entailing tougher discipline and austerity measures.    Following a warning from the officially-backed OPZZ unionsthat sharp price hikes could spark confrontation, thegovernment has agreed that food prices this year will rise anaverage 9.6 pct instead of the planned 13 pct.    A statement last night said the government had "partiallyaccepted" demands for the protection of the low-paid and agreedto extend some social benefits.    But Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, at a separatemeeting yesterday, sharply criticised the slow pace of reforms.    He told an economic commission that tougher discipline andausterity measures, greater efficiency and initiative shouldreplace waste, red tape and inertia. He announced cost-cuttingmeasures affecting central administrative bodies.    OPZZ economic expert Zbigniew Kochan welcomed the move onfood prices. "This decrease was considerable," Kochan toldReuters today. "Also important is the fact that the governmentadmitted we were right and agreed to consult us over pricesfrom now on," he added.    The communique made no mention of curbs on wage increases,or price rises in sectors including transport and energy.    The authorities have said prices could go up by as much as26 pct as state subsidies are sharply reduced in an effort tomake the market more free and to improve efficiency.    The OPZZ unions are officially recognised by the governmentand replaced the Solidarity movement suppressed under martiallaw. They claim a membership of seven million.    Western diplomats said today the climb-down on food priceswas a limited concession. "This is a small price to pay if theycan push through the other price rises," one said, adding thatfuel and energy rises would have a more significant effect.    He noted that there had been a concerted media campaign toprepare people for price rises, including a major article in amass-circulation women's magazine, "clearly aimed at those whodo the shopping," he said.    Other articles in the official press this week have focusedon coal, which sells to both industrial and private consumersat far less than either the production or export costs.    Countering scepticism from opposition sources and formerSolidarity activists as to OPZZ's role, Kochan said "It wasdefinitely not a question of gaining credibility, but trueconcern for people's living standards."    Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Koziol said the authorities'main aim was not to harm workers' living standards. But he wasalso quoted by the official PAP news agency as saying thegovernment had to take current economic realities into account. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, CFTC LIMIT PLAN MAY NOT REVERSE LIQUIDITY DROP, A proposal by the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission, CFTC, to raise federal limits on futuresspeculative positions for certain agricultural commoditycontracts would not reverse a decline in liquidity in thosemarkets that started in 1981, two CFTC commissioners said.    Commissioners William Seale and Kalo Hineman told a HouseAgriculture subcommittee a recent proposal that would have theeffect of raising deferred month speculative position limits onseveral agricultural commodity contracts would notsubstantially increase liquidity in those months.    "I seriously doubt that increasing speculative limits willcreate a great deal of liquidity in the back months," Sealetold the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Creditand Rural Development.    Analysts have attributed much of the liquidity squeeze to a1981 tax law change, which by changing the treatment ofso-called straddles limited the ability of futures commissionmerchants to roll positions forward for tax purposes.    CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips said only that the commissionwould take into account Congress' recommendation that federalspeculative limits be raised.    The Chicago Board of Trade and the MidAmerica CommodityExchange have expressed concern that the CFTC plan woulddecrease spot month limits for certain of their contracts. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, FED'S HELLER URGES BROAD REFORM TO AID BANKING, Federal Reserve Board GovernorRobert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened bypermitting formation of financial services holding companiesinvolved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate andsecurities.    In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bankand Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, "I believethat increased diversification along geographic and productlines is the key to strengthening the American banking system."    He said he supported the idea of financial services holdingcompanies advocated by the Association of Bank HoldingCompanies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiarieswould be handled on functional lines.    "Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by thebank to the associated institutions, and all transactions wouldhave to be on an arms-length basis," Heller said.    Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.    Heller said he "would require the holding company to serveas a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment tomaintain the bank's capital.    "In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail aslong as the holding company has a positive net worth."    Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permittedto own a financial services holding company, again with theprovision that capital would flow to the financial enterpriseif necessary.    Heller said the effects of these actions "would be banksthat are at least as strong as the corporations holding them" inwhich customer deposits were assured while any incentive to"loot the bank" was removed.    Such diversification would give access to national andinternational financial services to corporations across theUnited States.    Heller said that would mean "the steady decline of America'sbanks in the world financial league tables would be arrested" bypermitting them to become more competitive. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, CFTC SEES NO TRADING, TRIPLE WITCHING RULES, The chairman of the CFTC, SusanPhillips, said she does not expect the CFTC to restrict dualtrading or to intervene in the quarterly expiration of stockindex futures and their options.     "At this time we have no plans to reexamine our policy (ondual trading)," she told the House Subcommittee onConservation, Credit and Rural Development.    She said it would not be appropriate to ban dual tradingbecause it would decrease market liquidity.    Dual trading refers to the ability of futures commissionmerchants to trade for their own as well as their clients'accounts. Exchange rules prohibit a broker from attempting tobenefit from the market impact of a client's order by tradingon his own account before placing the client's order.    CFTC has required all futures exchanges by July 1 to haveimplemented audit trails permitting the reconstruction of alltrades to the nearest minute. The move was designed in part todiscourage abuse of dual trading.    The board of directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchangehas proposed limiting but not banning dual trading in theStandard and Poor's 500 stock index future pit.    Phillips indicated the CFTC would not move beyond requiringimproved audit trails in its effort to allay concerns aboutdual trading abuses.    "It would be inappropriate at this point until we see howthe audit trail will work," she said in response to a question.    On triple-witching, Phillips said recent experiments bymarkets to quell price fluctuations have been quite successfuland that users of securities and derivative instruments werestill learning how to deal with the quarterly phenomenon.    Triple-witching refers to the simultaneous expiration ofstock index futures, options on those futures and options oncertain individual stocks.

reut2-010.sgm, ADMINISTRATION SAYS INSURANCE CRISIS EASED, The Reagan administration said thenational crisis in liability insurance eased during the pastyear as the insurance industry's profits more than doubled to11.5 billion dlrs, but some problems still persist.    An administration working group, in an update of its reporta year ago, found that insurance premiums generally havestabilized, but at high levels, as the crisis has abated.    After severe financial difficulties in 1984 and 1985, theinsurance industry's rate of return last year recovered to thesame level as the performace of U.S. corporations in general,the group said in a 98-page study.    While the crisis has eased, the study found that liabilityinsurance will likely remain expensive and continue to bedifficult to obtain for some lines of coverage and for somesectors of the American economy.    Some types of insurance, especially associated withenvironmental liability, remain unavailable for many companiesat any price, it said.    The increased availability and the price stability forinsurance the past year has been accompanied by higherdeductibles, lower coverage limits and additional policyrestrictions, the study said.    The administration last year unveiled a wide range ofrecommendations aimed at dealing with the crisis, including limits on punitive damages and awards for pain, suffering andmental anguish at 100,000 dlrs.    Attorney General Edwin Meese told a news conference todaythat the administration still supports state efforts to placelimits on damage awards and to enact other reforms of the tortlaws.    Assistant Attorney General Richard Willard denied chargesby consumer groups that the insurance crisis was caused byindustry collusion to raise rates in violation of the antitrustlaws. Willard, the head of the working group, said excessivejury damage awards was the main reason for the insuranceliability problem. Reuter&#3;

"We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game," hetold reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct ofStandard's stock.    Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of itsplanned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would notidentify, as saying BP's careful evaluation means the companyis not going to raise its offer.    "I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I thinkthe price is very fair and it is much to early to speculateabout ligigation," he said. "Let's wait and see how the offerruns."    Another official declined to speculate under whatcircumstances BP might raise its bid.    The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 timesStandard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independentevaluation of the company's assets, including the value of itsoil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves.    He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;SC> paidfor publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 timescash flow.    The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pctpremium over Standard's stock price over the past year.    BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to asmuch as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for itsoffer will come from existing sources. The rest will befinanced by new debt.    BP will draw in cash from its operating companies aroundthe world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line ofcredit, he explained.    The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer iscompleted, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pctwithin 12 months, he added.    Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publiclyheld shares are held by financial institutions.    Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer onMarch nine and has been considering it since that time.    He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems thatwould delay completion of the acquisition. "We have informedWashington of our intentions and we've already been an integralpart of ownership of U.S. oil reserves," he pointed out.    Simon said there is a good chance that current world oilprices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and thatthe more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy inSaudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production.    "We think there are signals that current conditions aremore favorable than they have been for sometime," Simon said.

reut2-010.sgm, BP&lt;BP> OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES, British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co hassignalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.    "I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation andclear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and theythink the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,"said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not alreadyown.    "It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won thewar and oil prices are not going to crack," said Prescott, Balland Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.    "Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of theenergy issues out there in the stock market, particularly thosethat are acquisition targets," Lazier said.    One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, anenergy-steel concern which had been courted by investor CarlIcahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes aCourt last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.    Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firmsfalling into takeover situations for several years, with theexception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most ofthe majors found partners in the last round of matchmakingwhich ended two years ago, and others restructured to the pointthat they have become unattractive.    U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. ExxonCorp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. UnocalCorp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.    Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost itsoffer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained itwould not raise the 70 dlr bid.    British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.    Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid inthe first place indicates that the British oil giant haschanged its outlook for the oil industry.    Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of themore bearish positions on oil prices.    "They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (abarrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hastyretreat from that point of view," Margoshes said.    "They are more appropriately today looking moreoptimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs(long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe thatwill be exceeded," Margoshes said.    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate wastrading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.    Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buyup the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share whenoil prices were falling last year.    They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightlymore than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oilfield. Analysts also said the company has other interests inthe Alaskan North Slope.    Analysts said the Standard investment is extremelyattractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market andhas hard-to-replace reserves.    "I think it just fits in with their long-range plans toincrease their position in the U.S. market," Dean Witteranalyst Eugene Nowak said.    Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of theBritish government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BPstock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holdingsometime in the year beginning April one.    After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserveswould be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock isheld in the U.S.    "The only way they can sell all that stock is to move itinto the United States. No other market can handle all thatstock," said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.    In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs onrevenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the yearearlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.     Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, PIK CERTIFICATES COST MORE THAN CASH -- GAO, The U.S. General Accounting Officesaid generic commodities certificates cost the U.S. governmentin total Commodity Credit Corp outlays 107 mln to 653 mln dlrsmore than cash payments through February, 1987.    However, GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley, intestimony prepared for delivery to the Senate AgricultureCommittee, said short-term commodity storage cost savingsrelated to the use of payment-in-kind certificates could befrom about 169 mln 253 mln dlrs.    U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said theissuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates in fiscal years1986-88 could cost as much as 550 mln dlrs more than cashoutlays.    In his prepared remarks to the Senate panel, Amstutzstressed that USDA was "very pleased with the success of usingcommodity certificates" and looked forward to their continueduse.    He said the cost of using certificates must be weighedagainst immediate benefits, including greater market liquidity,improved market price competitiveness, higher farm income,improved debt situation and decreased carrying charges,especially pertaining to 1985 crop loans.    Crowley said future government storage costs would bereduced only if in the long run certificates led to a decreasein CCC-owned inventory.    "We believe that such a reduction, if it occurs, will notbe large," Crowley said.    Crowley also said that because certificate amounts are notincluded in the federal budget's outlay totals at the time ofissuance, they could "lessen the usefulness of the budget."    Crowley conceded that certificates help farmers avoidstorage costs, give them marketing flexibility and enhancefarmers' incomes.    He also said certificates have benefited the grain industryby giving it easier access to CCC-owned grain at market prices. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, PARIS G-6 MEET SET NO TARGETS - LEIGH-PEMBERTON, Bank of England Governor RobinLeigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leadingindustrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets.    Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committeethat "we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding" onhow to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around theircurrent levels.    He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of jointcurrency float - but one which let it still purse anindependent monetary policy. "I would concede that, since theLouvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something,"Leigh-Pemberton said.    "The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effectiverole for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together"towards stabilising exchange rates," Leigh-Pemberton said.    He did not mention this week's intervention by centralbanks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test theaccord.     Leigh-Pemberton said that "the effectiveness of this(cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought inthe pre-Plaza days" before September 1985.    He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadlysought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effectivein our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing."    He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadlysought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effectivein our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing."    Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank ofEngland favoured full EMS membership for sterling, providedsuch a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetarypolicy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rateslower, he said "the two half point cuts (this month in banks'base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now."    Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a "cautious step-by-stepapproach" to reducing short term interest rates, not leastbecause "we have a potential problem with inflation."    Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, "oneof the highest" among industrialised nations, he added.    Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wantedbase rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budgeton March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets forsuch a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10pct.    Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pembertonsaid that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall.    He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrelmight suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterlingindex, when compared with the index's level before oil pricesdropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975,closed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close. Reuter&#3;

Speaking to reporters after a speech to a Toronto businessgroup, Reuber said: "I think at this stage it is really tooearly to say very much about (the Brazilian debt situation) butwe're pretty confident that things will work out."    He declined to comment on when such a settlement waslikely. Bank of Montreal had 1.98 billion dlrs in loans toBrazil as of last September 30, the most of any Canadian bank.     Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.     Asked if Bank of Montreal were considering declaring itsBrazil loans non-performing, Reuber replied: "We haven't reallygot to that point because we don't think we will have to facethat issue."    Some bankers in the U.S. said earlier this week that slowprogress in talks between Brazil and its major foreign lendershas increased the likelihood that U.S. banks will declare theirBrazil loans non-performing at the end of the quarter.     Reuber told reporters the bank was still pondering itsstrategy regarding possible entry into the securities businessafter June 30 when banks and other financial institutions willbe allowed full participation in the Ontario securitiesindustry.    He said price would help determine if the bank formed itsown securities unit or acquired an existing investment dealer,adding that asking prices for some dealers seem "fairly high."    Asked about plans for wholly owned Harris Bankcorp Inc, ofChicago, Reuber said Harris might consider acquiring more smallcommunity banks around Chicago.    "In addition, I think we are giving some consideration tothe possibility of extension into other states," Reuber said ofHarris, although he added that any such move was unlikely thisyear.    In his speech, focusing on current free trade talks betweenthe U.S. and Canada, Reuber said failure to reach a deal wouldnot represent a calamity for Canada but could lower Canada'sstandard of living, raise unemployment and reduce the country'sworld trading influence.

The actions affect 5.5 billion dlrs of debt.    Moody's said the downgrade reflected its concern overprospects for material improvement in the holding company'soperating profitability in the medium term.    Cut were BankAmerica's senior debt to Ba-1 from Baa-3,subordinated debt to Ba-3 from Ba-1, preferred stock to B-1from Ba-3 and commercial paper to Not-Prime from Prime-3.    BankAmerica is the second-largest bank holding company inthe U.S.    Moody's reduced the subsidiary BankAmerica OverseasFinance's senior debt to Ba-1 from Baa-3 and subordinated debtto Ba-3 from Ba-1. That debt is guaranteed by the parent.    The rating agency also cited the holding company'scontinuing high level of problem assets, including significantexposure to Latin American debtor countries, that will continueto pressure profitability.    However, Moody's noted that BankAmerica Corp remains liquidand owns considerable marketable assets.    Moody's said it affirmed the ratings of the Bank of Americaunit because of that bank's franchise value, significant coredeposit base and an expectation of regulatory support iffurther stresses develop.

reut2-010.sgm, U.S. BANK PAPER UNDER LIGHT PRESSURE IN MARKET, Debt securities of major U.S. bankscame under light selling pressure in secondary trading on theheels of Standard and Poor's Corp's downgrade of six moneycenter banks late yesterday, analysts and traders said.    But they described market response as muted because the Sand P action came as no surprise. Besides, many participantshad already shied away from bank issues following Brazil'ssuspension of interest payments last month, traders added.    "The downgrades were expected for some time. In fact, youcan argue that S and P is lagging the market," commented onetrader.    On February 20, Brazil said it would suspend interestpayments on about 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercialbanks. No date was established for the renewal of payments.    In its action, Standard and Poor's cited the exposure tomajor Latin American debtor countries of Chase Manhattan Corp&lt;CMB>, Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL>, Irving Bank Corp &lt;V> andManufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC>.    The rating agency also downgraded Mellon Financial Corp&lt;MEL> and Security Pacific  Corp &lt;SPC>, but said this reflectedhigher non-performing assets and weaker operating resultsrather than the international debt problem.    "The S and P downgrades were a non-event," a trader said."Anyone who was caught unaware was not on top of the situationanyway."    Said another trader, "People talked about this before andafter S and P's announcement. There was not much reaction amongbank issues today, though prices are still below par."    Still, market watchers said the action further underminedsentiment for bank paper.    Because of Brazil's suspension of interest payments, U.S.bank paper has underperformed such other sectors as utilities,telephones and industrials, analysts pointed out.    Even though Standard and Poor's affirmed the debt ratingsof Citicorp &lt;CCI>, Bankers Trust New York &lt;BT>, Bank of BostonCorp &lt;BKB> and J.P. Morgan and Co Inc &lt;JPM>, few buyers can befound for securities issued by those banks, traders said.    "Let's face it. Investors believe these banks are alsoexposed to Latin and other debtor countries. And investors buyon perceptions," said one broker.    About the only bright spots in an otherwise dull bankingsector of the secondary corporate market are U.S. regionalbanks and Japanese banks because investors perceive them asless exposed to the debtor nations, analysts pointed out.

Taylor also said it was vital that the federal government retain its existing powers under Ottawa's major new proposalsto revamp the country's financial system.    "Unless great care is taken now, in the detailed draftingand implementation of regulatory change, we could actually endup weakening our financial system," Taylor told a businessluncheon.    "Also, we must avoid costly and inefficient duplication ofregulation and supervision between federal and provincialauthorities," Taylor continued.    Earlier this week Federal Minister of State for Finance,Tom Hockin, said progress was being made with his provincialcounterparts on the proposals that involve removing thetraditional barriers separating the banking, securities and insurance sectors.    The governments are attempting to resolve a jurisdictionaldispute over who regulates what under the new system. Theprovinces have traditionally had authority in the securitiesfield while Ottawa oversaw the banking sector.    But the Chairman of Canada's largest bank stressed that Ottawa should retain its regulatory powers to "preserve anefficient, competitive, national financial system."    On the free trade talks under way with the U.S., Taylorsaid Canadian negotiators must insure banks have as much accessto the American market as U.S. institutions are granted here.    He told a new conference later he was "reasonablyconfident" the Canadian side was making reciprocity infinancial services an issue at the negotiating table. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, U.K. DEALERS DOUBT HUGE JAPANESE CASH INFLUX, Many London equity dealers doubt whetherthe much publicised flood of Japanese investment into the U.K.Equity market will be as large as some analysts have forecast.    There has recently been much speculation that the Japanesewould look towards the U.K. Stock market for investmentopportunities on a much larger scale when the new fiscal yearbegins next month. Last October's reorganisation of the stockmarket, known as 'Big Bang', paved the way for greaterparticipation by overseas investors.    Some analysts believe the Japanese have earmarked massivesums for investment in Europe.    Both the London and Tokyo markets have moved ahead stronglysince the start of this year. But London has lagged behind inreal terms and therefore is now beginning to look like giving abetter return on any funds that are reserved for equityinvestment. Sterling's firmness also means there are profits tobe made from the currency turn. However, many equity dealerspolled by Reuters think that the Japanese will shy away fromLondon and continue to invest in instruments such as U.S.Government securities.    Even if they do diversify from their old stamping groundsthey will head for the U.S. Equity market before they come tothe European stock markets, one dealer predicted.    "The Japanese, although very aggressive in markets that theyknow, tend to be more conservative in those they don't...Evenif they do come to London in a big way they would tend to gomore for the fixed interest gilt edged market rather than themore volatile equities," he added.    He also cited the forthcoming U.K. General election asanother factor in keeping Far Eastern money out of the Londonstock market.    "The Japanese do not like too much uncertainty and a generalelection creates just the kind that will keep them on thesidelines," one trader said.    There are also doubts whether the Japanese would find thetrack records of U.K. Companies strong enough to make themwilling to invest heavily. "Our industrial and manufacturingoutput may be looking better, but it must still look prettyuninspiring to the Japanese," one broker said.    Some market participants, however, are a little morebullish and do expect more, although not a massive amount, ofFar Eastern funds to come to London in the short term.    They point out that capital gains on U.S. Bonds, a marketin which the Japanese are traditionally heavy players, havebeen eroded because of the fall in the U.S. Dollar and thiscould prompt them to move funds out of the U.S. But even thosewho are mildly bullish concede that Japanese investors on theLondon exchange would almost certainly confine themselves tolonger term investment in 10 or 15 leading 'blue chip' issues,which may include industrial giants such as ICI, Hanson Trust,British Petroleum, Glaxo and Unilever.    One analyst said he believed if there was such investmentin blue chip issues, recently privatised companies such asBritish Gas and British Telecom could be left out in the cold.    He said that with an election coming up, overseas investorswould be worried that a Labour victory would bring a policy ofre-nationalisation of such companies. The Labour party has inthe past said it would do this.    Some of the recent rise in U.K. Equities has anticipated anincrease in Japanese buying in the near future. Reuter&#3;
reut2-010.sgm, FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER, French Agricultural MinisterFrancois Guillaume warned that France would flatly rejectproposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugarand oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt thesemarkets.    The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the interventionperiod and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase thefinancial burden on the sugar producers will also result inlower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.    "I give you my word that France, while it will not rejecttechnical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply replyin the negative to these bad reforms," Guillaume told the annualconference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).    Community agricultural ministers are due to meet againMonday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spirallingEC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.    Relations between the government and farmers have becomestrained in France in recent months.    There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations byfarmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices andfurther cutbacks in Community milk output.    But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisationof the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a majorproducer of both crops -- won him warm applause from theFNSEA's farmers.    His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for thecomplete dismantling of the system of cross border taxesdesigned to smooth out currency differences known as MonetaryCompensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoidfurther protests by producers.    Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to goahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroadagainst the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farmsector.    "The Minister's proposals back up our determination toorganise union action in the coming weeks," he told reporters,adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on aministerial level.    Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before beingappointed farm minister last spring.    Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt thatGuillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.    There have been certain advances on cutting productioncosts, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, butthere are still areas where more could be done such as onfarmers' indebtedness, he said.    Guillaume told the conference the government will makeavailable 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producersreduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.    The government has already announced financial aid for themilk sector and it was not clear how much of the packageannounced today was new aid, Lacombe said. Reuter&#3;

The committee went over a package of deficit reductionsproposed by its chairman, Democrat Lawton Chiles of Florida,which he said would reach the 108-billion-dlr deficit in 1988under the Gramm-Rudman budget law -- using President Reagan'seconomic estimates.    Using the Congressional Budget Office estimates, whichCongress usually relies on, would produce a deficit of 134billion dlrs, Chiles said.    Under the Chiles plan, deficits would be cut fromanticipated levels by nearly 110 billion dlrs over four yearsto produce a 1991 balanced budget--the target of the GrammRudman law.    For 1988, the Chiles formula would cut the deficit by 37billion dlrs, half through defence and non defence savings,mthe rest through revenues.    Defence would be cut nearly 6.9 billion dlrs. Reaganproposed hiking outlays by some 8 billion dlrs.

The subsidiary of Honda Motor Co Ltd &lt;HMC.T> of Japanshipped 200 of its popular Accord cars to Taiwan earlier thismonth, the spokesman said. The company might also eventuallysend U.S.-made cars to Japan, he said.    The automaker said it would not boost its U.S. imports ofcars from Japan, but instead make up demand for its cars in theU.S. by increasing U.S. production.    The shipment to Taiwan was part of planned shipments toSan-Yan Industries of Taiwan of about 2,000 Accords a year.    Honda said it does not make Accords in Taiwan, and isprevented by Taiwanese import restrictions from shipping themthere from Japan.    Those restrictions were loosened this year to allow importsfrom the United States. Previously no imports of foreign-builtcars were allowed, the spokesman said.    The Accords were built at Honda's U.S. car and motorcycleproduction facility at Marysville, Ohio. Honda in the past hassent motorcycles from Marysville to Europe and Australia, andhas sent cars to Canada.    Honda's U.S. output would have to be adjusted to meetchanging U.S. demand, the spokesman said. He quoted AmericanHonda president Tetsuo Chino as saying, "Honda will notincrease U.S. imports beyond the current level even ifvoluntary export restrictions on Japanese cars are lifted."     Analysts say there are few signs Japan's restrictions will belifted.    Honda might decide by the end of this year whether toexpand its U.S. production, the spokesman said.    Honda said it is considering building either of its two newluxury models--the "Legend" or "Integra"--in the United States.    The Legend and Integra, two models of the company's Acuraline, were introduced last March. If the cars prove popularenough, one of them could be built at the Ohio plant, or at anew factory, the spokesman said.    The spokesman said it is possible Acuras built in theUnited States could be shipped back to Japan. However, he saidthat decision has not yet been made, and would follow thedecision to build the cars in the United States.    If demand for either one of the two cars reaches 100,000vehicles a year, Honda could decide to build the cars in theU.S., the company said.    Sales of the Integra through February have outpaced theLegend--35,768 against 29,824--but the spokesman said Hondaexpects sales to "lean more heavily toward Legend" this yearbecause a two-door Legend has been added to the line.

The sources said they believe the committed four yearrevolving credit - the largest of its kind in the euromarkets -carries a facility fee of 1/8 pct and that drawings will be at1/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).    Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York, which is arrangingthe financing in conjunction with its London operation, was notavailable to commment on the terms.    BP announced it was arranging the financing earlier todayas part of its planned tender offer for the 45 pct of StandardOil Co that it does not own already.    In addition to the revolving credit, BP also is arranging aU.S. commercial paper program for an as yet undeterminedamount, which will be supported by the revolver.    Bankers noted that the terms on the new facility compareextremely favourably to those on other short-term facilitiesfor which pricing has turned extremely fine due to competitionfor the mandates. It also contrasts with the 1/16 pct fee BPpaid on a recent 1.5 billion dlr refinancing of some existingdebt.    Earlier today a Morgan Guaranty official, while decliningto reveal the pricing on the facility said that banks would be"compensated fairly" since this is a special purpose facilitywhich must be completed quickly, with the signing expected inabout 10 days.    The facility is only being syndicated among BP'srelationship banks and therefore has large individualcommitments from the banks. Lead managers are being recruitedat the 200 mln dlr level, co-lead managers at 125 mln andmanagers at 75 mln.    However, bankers said that despite the size it is likelythe financing will get done quickly since banks will want to beseen as supporting the relationship.

GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434,682 billion lirelast year from 423,064 billion in 1985. On a current pricesbasis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985.     But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise inunemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, theministry said.    The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation ofthe dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countriessuch as Italy.    These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3pct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985.    They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance.    On the basis of data recently recalculated by the nationalstatistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986of 3,722 billion lire, the report said.

Sen.

"We must provide some form of interest rate buydown,principal reduction relief for all eligible farmers andranchers regardless of their lending institution," Boren said.    Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen.James McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package shouldcover all lenders to agriculture.    The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsementsfor the across-the-board approach from the nation's largestfarm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, andfrom the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden thefocus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system.Until now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on howto resurrect the failing system.    Boren said borrowers from private lenders such ascommercial banks and life insurance companies must be includedin the aid package because "it would not be fair to addressonly the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers."    However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-boardinterest rate or principal buydown did not say how much thebroad approcah would cost.

reut2-010.sgm, U.S. SEC MULLS REQUIRING ACCOUNTING FIRM REVIEWS, The federal Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) proposed new rules that would requireaccounting firms that audit public companies to submit to aperiodic outside review of their operations.    The SEC voted unanimously to seek public comment on theplan, under which an accounting firm would have to hire anotherfirm to conduct a so-called "peer review" every three years orlose the right to audit public companies.    SEC officials conceded peer review would not end allaudit failures but said they hoped it would eliminate audits byclearly unqualified firms and individuals.    "Peer review will not stop all bad audits; we recognizethat," SEC Chief Accountant Clarence Sampson told the five SECcommissioners.    "But we hope the rule will go far to eliminate auditsperformed by individuals without the necessary skills toconduct a proper audit," Sampson said.    The move is largely symbolic, since firms and individualsresponsible for auditing 84 pct of all public companies alreadyvoluntarily undergo peer review every three years, under anaccounting industry self-regulatory plan.    But the SEC has been under pressure for years from somefederal lawmakers to make the accounting industry more open andaccountable to the public.    Agency officials estimated that a peer review would costthe average accounting firm between 1,500 and 2,500 dlrs, or500 to 750 dlrs a year.    "I don't think that (cost) is a dispositive issue," SECChairman John Shad said. "It's within a reasonable range ofcost."    The proposal would exempt foreign auditors of non-U.S.companies required to file financial reports with the SEC. Reuter&#3;

The agency cited British Petroleum's 7.4 billion dlr tenderoffer today for the remaining 45 pct of Standard Oil shares itdoes not already own.    Moody's said that while British Petroleum has greatlystrengthened its capital structure over the past few years,this acquisition would seriously affect the company'sliquidity, leverage and interest coverage.    Moody's noted that British Petroleum would use more thantwo billion dlrs of excess cash and marketables and about fivebillion dlrs of new acquisition debt to fund the transaction.    In addition, the minority interest and deferred incometaxes attributable to Standard Oil would be excluded fromBritish Petroleum's capitalization. That would result in atotal debt to capital ratio of nearly 50 pct, Moody's said.    The rating agency said it would study B.P.'s strategy torestore financial flexibility after the acquisition. Moody'ssaid that may include divestiture of various petroleum andnon-petroleum assets and operations of B.P. and Standard.    But Moody's noted that after the major asset writedown anddivestiture progress achieved by Standard Oil in 1985, fewernon-petroleum assets are available for sale.

reut2-010.sgm, BP &lt;BP> MAY HAVE TO RAISE BID -  ANALYSTS, British Petroleum Co PLC may have toraise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publiclytraded shares of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD>, analysts said.    "There's a lot of speculation here that someway or otherthey would be forced to come up with another bid," said RosarioIlaqua of L.F. Rothschild.    And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial todaythat BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remaineda distinct possibility.    Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/ShellGroup's &lt;RD> &lt;SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell OilCo in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised itsinitial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, afterlawsuits by minority shareholders.    "I think they're going to have to go a little highereventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higherfor the Shell Oil minority shares," Bruce Lazier of PrescottBall and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.    Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pctof Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. Afterobjections from minority shareholders about the price, RoyalDutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tenderoffer in April 1984.    But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of theoffer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil,Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.    It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstandingShell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid ofabout 5.2 billion dlrs.    The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks ata BP press conference in New York this afternoon.    Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc toldclients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. Theanalyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.    Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of theRoyal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholderlawsuits for the same reason, they said.    Goldman Sachs and Co, BP's investment advisor, advised theShell Oil board in 1984 and 1985. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, FORMER HERSTATT DEALER CAN BE SUED, COURT RULES, The former chief currencydealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreignexchange speculation in West Germany's biggest banking crash,can stand trial for damages, a court ruled.    The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a casefor damages should not be allowed after such a long interval.    Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mlnmarks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.    The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of overone billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,and led to a tightening of banking regulations.    The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marksannounced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud incurrency transactions.    Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when itcollapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bankwere jailed in 1983.    But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he producedmedical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution duringhis childhood, which might have led him to take his own life. Reuter&#3;
reut2-010.sgm, NEXT FEW MONTHS CRUCIAL FOR OIL - HERNANDEZ, Energy and Mines Minister ArturoHernandez Grisanti today told a meeting of regional oilexporters the next few months will be critical to efforts toachieve price recovery and stabilize the market.     Hernandez said while OPEC and non-OPEC nations havealready made some strides in their efforts to strengthen themarket, the danger of a reversal is always present.    "March and the next two or three months will be a reallycritical period," Hernandez said. He said, "We will be able todefine a movement, either towards market stability and pricerecovery or, depending on the market, a reversal."    Earlier this week, Hernandez said Venezuela's oil price hasaveraged just above 16 dlrs a barrel for the year to date. IfOPEC achieves its stated goal of an 18 dlrs a barrel averageprice, he said, Venezuela's should move up to 16.50 dlrs.    Hernandez spoke today at the opening of the fifthministerial meeting of the informal group of Latin American andCaribbean oil exporters, formed in 1983.    Ministers from member states Ecuador, Mexico,Trinidad-Tobago and Venezuela are attending the two dayconference, while Colombia is present for the first time as anobserver.    Hernandez defined the meeting as an informal exchange ofideas about the oil market. However, the members will alsodiscuss ways to combat proposals for a tax on imported oilcurrently before the U.S. Congress.    Following the opening session, the group of ministers metwith President Jaime Lusinchi at Miraflores, the presidentialpalace.

reut2-010.sgm, IBM &lt;IBM> CLOSER TO LASER CHIP TESTING, International Business Machines Corpsaid scientists at its Zurich research laboratory have taken akey step toward developing a method of testing computer chipswith a laser.    The technique is important, IBM said, because it could leadto the development of tools that can determine the quality ofmicroscopic-sized computer chips without damaging them.    IBM said chip makers will need such advanced testingmethods to aid them in developing the next generation ofsemiconductors.    These chips will be smaller than today's chips but will beable to store vastly greater amounts of information.    IBM said its technique uses a laser light for "contactless"measuring of electrical signals on metal lines similar to thekind found in computer chip circuitry.    It said that using commercially available lasers, themethod should permit measurements of circuits with a width ofone micrometer or less.    A micrometer is about 80 times smaller than the thicknessof a sheet of paper. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, FARM CREDIT AID SEEN BROADENED TO OTHER LENDERS, Farm-state senators indicated theymay broaden a Farm Credit System rescue package to include aidfor borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks, aswell as the farm credit system.    Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the SenateAgriculture subcommittee responsible for farm credit, saidlegislation to rescue the financially-troubled system shouldprovide help to borrowers from all lenders to agriculture.    "We must provide some form of interest rate buydown,principal reduction relief for all eligible farmers andranchers regardless of their lending institution," Boren said.    Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen.James McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package shouldcover all lenders to agriculture.    The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsementsfor the across-the-board approach from the nation's largestfarm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, andfrom the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden thefocus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system.Until now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on howto resurrect the failing system.    Boren said borrowers from private lenders such ascommercial banks and life insurance companies must be includedin the aid package because "it would not be fair to addressonly the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers."    However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-boardinterest rate or principal buydown did not say how much thebroad approach would cost.    But Neil Harl, professor of economics at Iowa StateUniversity told the hearing the cost could be in the range of3.5 billion dlrs annually.    By trying to draw into the farm credit rescue package allfarm borrowers, Boren and other Senators appeared to bereacting to pressure from private lenders and their borrowers,who fear they will be put at a competitive disadvantage by thegovernment rescue of the farm credit system and its borrowers.    The farm credit system is the nation's largest lender toagriculture with 39 pct of all farm real estate loans, butprivate lenders account for nearly a quarter of loans onfarmland and 34 pct of farm operating loans, official figuresshow.    The American Bankers Association, in testimony to thehearing, warned the farm credit rescue should not be structuredto favor the system over other lenders.    As one way to meet the concern of private lenders, severalSenators, the farm credit system, and farm organizationsendorsed creation of a secondary market on farm real estateloans, called "aggie mae", which is sought by private lenders.    "We are also exploring the possibility of including in thefarm credit bill, the establishment of a secondary market foragricultural loans that would be available to all lenders,"Sen. Boren said.

"They will be able to raise the price again but I do notthink they will raise it as much as they did in 1979," Nancesaid. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.     Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predictedthat world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climbfrom a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.     "Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct inincreased demand," Shoup said, referring to the gas industry'soutlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal lawprohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plantsand utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15pct, he said.     Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities mayexperience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies nextwinter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.     Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20pct during 1986, he said.     "This does not mean the gas bubble is gone," Nance said."We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question ishow broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or threeyears before we start to climb out?"      J.C. Walter of &lt;Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recentimprovement in oil prices was not enough for independentproducers to begin new onshore drilling projects.     "If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlrper mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshoreexploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast byindependents in the 1990s are pretty dismal," Walter said.     He suggested that some independents may instead turn toexploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-outagreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have heldfinding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel,Walter said. Reuter&#3;

In a statement, Miller called the senator's proposal forthe government's fiscal 1988 budget would cut U.S. defensespending authority by more than 25 billion dlrs from PresidentReagan's request, resulting in a real reduction of militaryspending authority for the third year in a row.    While the plan would allow actual 1988 defense spending torise by 5.6 billion dlrs, domestic spending would be increasedby a disprportionate 42.7 billion dlrs, he said.    Miller also criticized the Chiles plan's call for a 13.6billion dlr tax increase.    "The president has said repeatedly that he would veto anytax increase," Miller said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-010.sgm, REPORT SAYS SOVIET ECONOMIC PLANS TOO OPTIMISTIC, The Soviet economy has grown at anincreased rate under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, but hisgoals may be too ambitious, according to a report from U.S.intelligence agencies.    The report was prepared jointly by the Central IntelligenceAgency and the Defense Intelligence Agency for theCongressional Joint Economic committee, which released it.    It said the Soviet economy grew by 4.2 pct in 1986,Gorbachev's first full year in power, twice the average rate ofgrowth over the previous 10 years.    Gorbachev's policies to improve worker attitudes, removeincompetent officials, reduce corruption and alcoholism andmodernize the country's industrial equipment accounted for someof the gains, the report said.    "Although many of the specific policies Gorbachev hasadopted are not new, the intensity Gorbachev has brought to hisefforts and his apparent commitment to finding long-termsolutions are attributes that his immediate predecessorslacked. Nonetheless, Gorbachev's program appears too ambitiouson a number of counts," the report said.    Earlier this week, two U.S. experts on the Soviet Unionsaid Gorbachev was likely to be ousted in three to four yearsif he continues his reform policies.    "I don't think he can last four years," Marshall Goldman ofHarvard University told a Congressional hearing. "He's moving sofast, he's stepping on so many toes."    A similar comment came from Peter Reddaway of theSmithsonian Institution's Kennan Institute for Advanced Russianstudies.    The economic report said meeting targets for commodityoutput would require unrealistic gains in productivity andindustrial output targets appear too high to allow time toinstall more advanced equipment.    None of Gorbachev's proposals would change the system ofeconomic incentives that has discouraged innovation andtechnological change, the report added.    "The first significant resistance to specific policies,although not overall goals, surfaced (in 1986) in both themassive government and party bureaucracy, particularly amongenterprise managers who complained that they were being askedto carry out conflicting goals -- such as to raise qualitystandards and output targets simultaneously," the report said.    The CIA-DIA report predicted two to three pct growth in theSoviet economy over the next several years. It said the SovietUnion trailed the U.S. by seven to 12 years in advancedmanufacturing technologies, such as computers andmicroprocessors. Reuter&#3;

The charge will be made against the allowance for possibleloan losses, and the writedown is of other real estate.    Great American said the examiners were conducting a regularexamination and a final report is not expected for severalweeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedownin response to the preliminary findings.    Great American said regulatory authorities are notrequiring an adjustment of the previously reported financialresults for Great American for 1986.    However, Great American has revised its previous estimatesof provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs tothe allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it tookthe action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete itsallowance for possible loan losses and the economic environmentdoes not show signs for significant improvement in the nearfuture.    It said the additional provision increases the allowance to26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loanportfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end.

reut2-010.sgm, PIK CERTIFICATES IN EYE OF U.S. BUDGET STORM, Senate Agriculture CommitteeChairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Congress would considerlimiting the use of generic commodity certificates as a meansof cutting government spending.     "I suspect that as we go into some of the budget debateswe're going to have on the floor, this is going to be part ofit," Leahy said, referring to proposals that the U.S.Agriculture Department save money by substituting cash outlaysfor payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates in price and incomesupport programs.     "I have a feeling that the PIK program, however the costis defined, is going to be one of the top number of areas thatpeople are going to be looking for savings," Leahy told ahearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee.     The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that thegovernment could save 1.4 billion dlrs during fiscal years1988-92 if it curbed the use of generic certificates by banningso-called "PIK and roll" transactions.     Several Democratic senators had harsh comments for genericcertificates.     "We're trying to take care of a bad situation --surpluses--by depressing the price. I don't see any benefits,"said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). "I don't see any benefit indriving their prices lower, lower, lower all the time."     But Sen. Rudy Boschwitz said he supported use ofcertificates. "By and large I'm favorably impressed by PIKcertificates. I feel they have been helpful," said Boschwitz.     As expected, officials from the General Accounting Officeand the U.S. Agriculture Department indicated their estimatesof the cost of PIK certificates compared to cash outlays werefar apart.     The General Accounting Office, GAO, told the committeethat PIK certificates increased total Commodity Credit Corpoutlays through 1987 by between 107 mln and 653 mln dlrs. GAOsaid that increase was offset by commodity storage cost savingsof beween 169 mln and 253 mln dlrs.     Pressed by the committee, GAO Senior Associate DirectorBrian Crowley said government spending probably was about 450mln dlrs above what it would have been had all program paymentsbeen made in cash, not counting storage savings.     Crowley also said he thought PIK certificates had loweredthe price of corn and boosted domestic consumption of corn.     Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz told thecommittee that the additional costs of using PIK certificatesand storage, handling and transportation costs "balance offvery closely."     Amstutz said he estimated the net cost of usingcertificates was about one pct higher than using only cash tomake program payments.     William Bailey, USDA deputy administrator for programplanning, said there were "one hundred issues I find eitherincorrect (in the GAO report), disagree with or where their(GAO) facts are inconsistent with what's going on."     Amstutz said GAO had not given USDA the option of"providing input" into the preparation of their report "as theyfrequently do."     The USDA undersecretary also conceded that certificatesand marketing loans had the similar effect of "putting moregoods into the market," but that while the department supportedcertificates, it would continue to oppose a marketing loan forwheat and feedgrains because it would cost too much.

UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, in a statement made in hisJamba headquarters in southern Angola and released by UNITA's Washington office, said he was prepared to guarantee safepassage for non-military freight as a gesture of "peace andreconciliation."    Savimbi challenged the Cuban-backed Angolan government,which controls the port, to match his offer and allow goods topass through. There was no immediate response from Luanda.    UNITA has been fighting the Cuban-backed Angolan governmentsince 1976.

reut2-010.sgm, FED DATA INDICATE POLICY LIKELY TO STAY ON HOLD, Federal Reserve data released todayindicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeksand that none is likely at next week's Federal Open MarketCommittee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.    "The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision ofreserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift sincethe beginning of this year," said Harold Nathan, economist atWells Fargo Bank.    "These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will notchange policy," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.    "The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no realreason for it to change policy," said Joseph Liro of S.G.Warburg and Co Inc.    Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and doesnot require immediate policy easing and the money aggregatesmay well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.    All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concernnow is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week washeavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurtingthe dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in loweringinterest rates further.    Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line withexpectations and similar to the data for most of this year.    The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mlndlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesdayversus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.    In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at thediscount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrscompared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statementperiod. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.    The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesdayand Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the datareleased today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.    The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of anypressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire toboost borrowings in the second week of the statement period tomeet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.    Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-weekborrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actuallyaveraged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and thatwas up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.    Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming fortwo-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mlndlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate ofaround 6.10 pct.    It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowingstarget since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, saidWells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead onthe funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to6-1/4 pct band.    Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding needare anticipated for the statement period that began today. More    Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to fourbillion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liroputs the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.    To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed toadd permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering tobuy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similarcoupon "pass" may be required later.    There will be a greater demand for funds in this statementperiod because it includes the close of the quarter. Furtherupward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from windowdressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31. Reuter&#3;
reut2-010.sgm, U.S. FARM CREDIT PROBLEMS SOLVABLE -BOARD MEMBER, Substantial difficulties faced by theU.S. farm credit system can be solved with a business-likeapproach to the problems, a Farm Credit Admimistration officialsaid.    Marvin R. Duncan, a member of the administration board,said the farm credit system faces unprecedented difficulties inits 70-year history.    Addressing Chicago business and agricultural economists,Duncan outlined three basic problems of the farm credit system.Those include the high cost of its debt, the quality of itsassets, and the management of its credit delivery system.    He said some of the system's debt carries interest rates ashigh as 15.65 pct and will not mature until the year 2007.    Of its 54.6 mln dlrs in assets, 24.1 pct are non-accrual,high risk or already forfeited property, which led to losses in1986 of 1.9 billion dlrs and in 1985 of 2.7 billion dlrs.    Problems with credit delivery have been somewhat resolved,he said.    "The system is still plagued with duplication in layers ofmanagement and decision-making, inadequate tailoring of creditservices to fit the emerging market, a large investment inbricks and mortar, and a management and directorate moreinsular to the marketplace than that of its competitors," hesaid.    He said solutions to the problems should - - provide assurances to farmers on borrowers stock and thestability of the farm credit system. - maintain confidence of investors who buy system securities. - address the high cost of the system's existing debt. - enable the Farm Credit System Capital Corporation to carryout its role as a workout bank.    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,said this week that the system may lose as much as 1.4 billiondlrs this year, and another board member, Jim Billington, saidCongress should plan to spend at least 800 mln dlrs beginninglate this year to bail out the system.    Duncan noted that the system has about 70 billion dlrs inassets, serves about 800,000 individual borrowers and 3,000cooperatives, and has 62.5 billion dlrs in securitiesoutstanding.    "With a business-like solution to its problems, it cancontinue that role for generations into the future," he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, GATT WARNS U.S. ON FEDERAL BUDGET, PROTECTIONISM, The United States' emphasis on itsforeign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's realproblem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the GeneralAgreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said.     By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billiondlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressurewhich threatens the world trading system, it said in an annualreport.    The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federalbudget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting governmentspending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt,it said.    GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pctin 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of theprevious two years.    GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism andinstead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the currentaccount payments deficit -- higher private savings, lowerinvestment and a smaller federal budget deficit.    Raising U.S. Trade barriers "would result in little or noreduction in the current account deficit. It would, however,increase inflation and reduce world trade," it said.    "The basic cause -- some combination of insufficientdomestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- wouldremain," the report said.    GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this yearbecause of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some WestEuropean nations as they adjust production and workforces to alow dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over ThirdWorld debt management and looming protectionism.    The report also said imbalances in the current accounts ofJapan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986.    The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changeswere not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added.    "Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reducedas a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was notborne out last year," the report said.    GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in theU.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidlyexpanding money supply and low dollar.    "Such a development could worsen the business climate byincreasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, inturn, would adversely affect world trade."    But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to theUnited States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makesforeign products more expensive.    It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both humanand in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce thegoods and services sought from abroad.    World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986,about half of the rate of the previous year.    Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct,continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATTsaid.    Developing countries' exports declined significantly, whiletheir imports increased moderately, although full statisticsare not available yet, GATT said.    The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nationswere sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia,Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports. REUTER&#3;

The index showed a 0.4 pct drop in January.    The February index was down one pct from a year earlier forthe third consecutive year-on-year drop.    In January, the index fell 1.1 pct from a year earlier, thefirst drop of over one pct since a 1.3 pct drop in September1958.    In February petrol prices increased but winter clothingprices stayed low and vegetable prices fell.    The February year on year fall was due to lower vegetable,fuel oil, petrol, electricity and gas prices, and despitehigher housing, education, footwear and clothing costs.    The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area(base 1985) in mid-March rose 0.4 pct from a month earlier to100.6, reflecting higher vegetable prices.

They would give no details, noting that the White House hadnot commented on the decision. The administration has beenunder pressure to retaliate.    There was no immediate announcement on the council'sdecision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the seniorpolicy group's move on curbs reflected growing Americanfrustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices.    U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act onthe recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aideson the foreign policy implications of retaliation.    The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for alast try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reachedlast July governing trade in semiconductors.    Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumpingsemiconductors in world markets and to open its own market toU.S.-made semiconductors.    In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumpingduties on Japanese semiconductor shipments.    The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S.Market but has continued in third countries, and that theJapanese market remains closed.    The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimouscall by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanesehigh technology products containing semiconductors.    A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductorindustry and from its chief trade union.    U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japanwould involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such astelevisions, video cassette recorders and computers. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP, India is searching for non-communistcountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit andconserve foreign exchange.    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering andelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, areall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State TradingCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).    "The two state trading corporations are free to use theirbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indianexports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding thatprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.    One trade source said India has targetted countries thatdepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreignimports.    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small partof India's total trading and are likely to account for lessthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in tradeduring the nine months ended December, the sources said.    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the EasternBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps ofagricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crudeoil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,against three billion in 1985/86.    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to helpnarrow the country's large trade deficit, is stillinsignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billionin the current fiscal year.    But the push to include non-communist countries incountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slowgrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promotingcountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were madediscreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannotofficially support bartering.    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron oreexports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.    "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause thatpreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kindfor goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,adding that the policy remains flexible.    "We also take into account other factors such as prices atwhich the goods and services are offered to India," the tradeofficial said.    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreigncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigsand railway equipment to India that they stood a better chanceif they bought Indian goods or services in return, the tradesources said.    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Koreanfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mlndlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.    In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buyIndian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pctsought by New Delhi, the trade official said.    "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"he added.    Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreigncurrency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol tobuy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe inexchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.    But despite India's new drive, countertrade has someinherent problems, they added.    "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement thatthe trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "Theother problem is it is often difficult to supply or buycommodities which the other party wants."    Another added, "Barter is also restrictive. We look upon itas a temporary measure to get over the current balance ofpayments difficulty.    "This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy." REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, NEC CORP TARGETS HOME ELECTRONICS BUSINESS, The president of Japan's biggest hightechnology firm, NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T>, is anything but worried,despite growing anti-Japanese protectionism, a soaring yen, anda stagnant world electronics market.    "The company's structure was developed by looking ahead,"Tadahiro Sekimoto told Reuters in an interview.    "We assumed the era of a strong yen, trade friction andglobalisation would arrive, and we moved ahead on that basis.There's no need to change our strategy now."    However, the world's largest manufacturer of microchips,the tiny silicon wafers which are the brains of most hightechnology products, knows it must keep looking ahead if it isto survive.    Hoping to build on existing strengths, NEC is now turningits focus on home electronics, an area of past weakness,Sekimoto said.    NEC wants to follow its corporate slogan "C and C" (Computersand Communications) to create high level home electronics thatgo beyond mere televisions and video tape recorders, Sekimotosaid.    Home electronics accounted for only eight pct of NEC'stotal 2,334.67 billion yen sales on a consolidated basis in theyear ended March 31, 1986.    Industry analysts say NEC is wise to target what will be amajor growth market in the future, but some warn the companyfaces some stiff competition.    "This is where the market is going to be for a long time --in products that combine personal computers, video display andtelecommunications networks," said Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltdanalyst Carole Ryavec. "But Matsushita (Electric Industrial CoLtd) may be there first."    But Sekimoto argues that NEC's overall strengths will carrythe day.    "Many companies are in the top 10 in computers or microchipsor telecommunications, but none is in the top 10 in all three.NEC is unique in that respect," he said.    To help its already high rankings, NEC will furtherincrease the high level of offshore production which makes itone of the most multinational of Japan's electronics firms.    The company will increase offshore output of all goods itsells overseas to 50 pct from a current 25 pct over the nextseveral years, Sekimoto said.    But the firm plans to go it alone in expanding overseas,despite moving last year to become joint owner, along withFrance's Cie des Machines Bull &lt;BULP.P>, of U.S. Firm HoneywellInc's &lt;HON> Information Systems unit.    "We hope to increase our share in the U.S. Market throughthe Honeywell tie-up. But our basic strategy is to take anindependent and autonomous route," said Sekimoto.    The company also plans to maintain its independent line bycontinuing to make computers which are not compatible withthose of International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, he said.    "Among the Japanese competitors, only NEC hasn't been caughtin software copyright disputes with IBM and our profits andmarket share have gradually expanded," Sekimoto said.    Once new ways of linking non-compatible computers areperfected, IBM compatibility will be irrelevant. "What willmatter is the best hardware, the best software and the bestability to meet customers needs," Sekimoto said.    In fact, NEC, which has over half of Japan's personalcomputer market, may go to court to stop competitors sellingcheaper machines which can run NEC software but infringecopyright on its operating system, an NEC spokesman said.    While industry analysts give NEC high marks for lookingahead, they note that it failed in forecasting microchipdemand. Like other Japanese chipmakers, the firm was left withserious excess capacity when lean years followed the boomtimes.    But after two years of cutbacks in capital investment inthe sector, Sekimoto thinks the time has come to boost spendingagain, if only slightly.    "We're not going to increase production. But we are going toinvest in new product development and upgrade existing plant,"he said.    Despite NEC's admitted strengths, analysts note the companyfaces tough times due to stagnant markets.    "NEC has excellent worldwide capacity and technology, butthey are caught in a downturn which may last a long time," saidSalamon's Ryavec.    The company forecasts such troubles will slash parent netprofits to 30 billion yen in the year ending March 31, 1987,down 43 pct from the previous year, although sales are expectedto rise eight pct to 2,130 billion yen.    Profits will improve only slightly next year, rising to 38billion yen on sales of 2,350 billion, it said. REUTER&#3;

Cents each for every ordinary share of par value twodlrs.    A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total1987 dividend of four cents per "B" share, while the "A" sharedividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents ashare.    Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.    Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.    It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Mathesonachieved the good performance through satisfactory results inmost sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG>,Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.    He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong KongLand, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of areorganisation, is "a long term investment and now stands at alevel which causes us no financial strain or problems of assetimbalance."    Keswick said the issue of new "B" shares will give the group"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares forexpansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability whichhas been brought about through the group's recentrestructuring."    He said the new issue is pending approval from both thefirm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriateadjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.    The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation,with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land tothe new unit &lt;Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>.    Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the twocompanies spun off from Hk Land -- &lt;Mandarin OrientalInternational Ltd> and &lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd>-- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.    Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrslast year, will become debt free after the restructuring.    "A positive cash flow from operations and disposals,continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,"Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests inairfreight operations, Australian properties and truckingbusiness, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.    Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against itsgeneral trading business in the Middle East in view of thecontinuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he saidthe operations would be profitable in the longer term.    He said the firm's function "has evolved into one primarilyof strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy."    He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the boardof directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacificregional board. He gave no further details of the change.    Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs atmidday on the Hong Kong stock market.

The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28from 813.0 mln a year earlier.    Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln ayear earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November31, BHP said in a statement.    Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end ofshare analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to620 mln dlrs.    BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents afterdeclaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced aone-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.    The bonus is being made from reserves which will notqualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction ofdividend imputation next July 1.    The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHPsaid.    BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate ofdividend will be maintained on the increased capital.    The level of future dividends will be influenced by theimplications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation,it said.    As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free inshareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits thathave borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.    BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, saidpetroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mlna year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.    BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflectedgenerally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Straitwhile the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domesticsales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of newplant and some operational difficulties.    The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrsfrom 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase inownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.    The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term,reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of &lt;Blue CircleSouthern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES, Philippine sugar production in the1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, SugarRegulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.    Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current millingseason, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimatewould almost certainly be met.    He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop wouldbe earmarked for domestic consumption.    Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for theU.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.    He said if the government approved a long-standing SRArecommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would takeup another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.    "The government, for its own reasons, has been delayingapproval of the project, but we expect it to come through byJuly," Yulo said.    Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oilimport bill by about 300 mln pesos.    Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready tostart manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.    The ethanol project would result in employment for about100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work bydepressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.    Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, hadbeen submitted to President Corazon Aquino.    "I think the President would rather wait till the newCongress convenes after the May elections," he said. "But thereis really no need for such quotas. We are right now producingjust slightly over our own consumption level."    "The producers have never enjoyed such high prices," Yulosaid, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesosper picul, up from 190 pesos last August.    Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculationfollowing the SRA's bid to control production.    "We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,"he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned fromtheir mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming andcloth production.    He said diversification into products other than ethanolwas also possible within the sugar industry.    "The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons," Yulo said."They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but theyrelocated many of them and diversified production. We want tocall this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry."    He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, usedfor thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.    "When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to producesugar," he said.    Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of theInternational Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.    "As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a newagreement which would revive world prices," Yulo said.    "If there is no agreement world prices will always bedepressed, particularly because the European Community issubsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets."    He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, whereproduction costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.    "If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents Iexpect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the endof this year," he said.    Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by1990, with world consumption outstripping production.    He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachmentsfrom artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.    "But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration," hesaid. "Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to theU.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cutours in half without any justification."    Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cutdomestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.    The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.    Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.    "At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the1986/87 season," he said. "We expect two or three more to followsuit during the next season." REUTER&#3;

In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister ShunjiroKarasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that theministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S.Firms that have expressed interest.    But it does oppose any foreign internationaltelecommunications carrier having a management role, he said.    The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Oppositionto the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to competewith the current monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, andto reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable andWireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said.    One of the rival firms, &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc>(ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firmsincluding General Electric Co &lt;GE>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> andCitibank NA &lt;CCI), and two European companies, ITJ presidentNobuo Ito said yesterday.

Merrill Lynch and CoInc &lt;MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc &lt;PAC>, both ofthe U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged themerger of the two firms because it says the market can onlysupport a single KDD competitor.    It has also rejected management participation by aninternational common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless,arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists.    Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, JonathanSolomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes amerger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share toless than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20pct, the ministry official said.

Michel Girardin, DRI Europe's senior economist, said at aconference that Italian GDP growth this year "will be mainlydriven by consumption and especially investment."    Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next yearwill shift from domestic demand to exports as a result ofexpected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies.    Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7pct in real terms in 1986.    DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pctin 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interestrates should drop two pct.    Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pctagainst the dollar this year following last year's 22 pctappreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against thedollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of itsvalue relative to the German currency, he said.

reut2-010.sgm, TRADE SURPLUS WILL POSE ADDED PRESSURES FOR JAPAN, Japan today announced another mammothmonthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure tointensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.    "The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for notmoving more quickly," Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economistEric Rasmussen said.    The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplussoared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion inJanuary and 4.77 billion a year ago.    The current account surplus, which includes trade inservices as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs lastmonth from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.    After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figureslook a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the tradesurplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs froma record 9.58 billion in January.    "In the medium term we expect this modest improvement tocontinue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward offfurther protectionism or further yen strength," said WilliamStirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.    A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive onworld markets while making imports into the country cheaper.    "On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making someprogress on getting exports down," Jardine's Rasmussen said.    But imports do not seem to be picking up much because theJapanese economy remains sluggish, he said.    Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slowerimport growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners workedoff stocks they had built up in January.    The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume ofexports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increasein January.    This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yenagainst the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impacton exports, they said.    But economists warned that may not be soon enough forJapan's trading partners. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH EXCHANGE RATE POLICY, Recent slackness on Dutch capitalmarkets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank'spolicy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German markand to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.    While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend theguilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more useof the range within which the guilder and the mark canfluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System(EMS).    Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV(Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious.    "I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely therange given to the guilder in the EMS," Nelissen said at thepresentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week.    Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate againstthe guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.    The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries tokeep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards astable exchange rate as its main target, using interest ratepolicies to influence the exchange rate.    The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rateaims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.    Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.    Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: "Bymaintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises theexpectation it will always intervene above that level. If itsuddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard toobtain."    Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interestrates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows ofsecurities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capitalmarket. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bringabout small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, headded.    Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this isa price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the CentralBank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully withthe mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.    "It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate differencebetween West Germany to maintain the exchange rate," he added.    Interest rate differentials between West Germany and theNetherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flowsbetween the two countries, as the economic performance of thetwo does not differ much, economists said.    Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and theNetherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 theyaccounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the twocountries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by theDutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.    Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interestand exchange rates.    West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single tradingpartner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct ofimports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau ofStatistics figures show.    At the moment, the rates for three month euromark depositstrade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have arate of around 5-7/16 pct.    Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate willeven rise further because of expectations of deflation here in1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.    In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected todecrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the DutchCentral Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflationbetween zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.    But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, moneydealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official ratesindependently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.    Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its creditsurcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they hadexpected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.    The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impacton the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.    While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of itspolicies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the rangenarrow.    "The European Monetary System is not only a relationshipbetween the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of themargin between the two would implicate we have to buy or selllarge amounts of a third currency," Central Bank vice-directorJan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.    "If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, themarkets would start to believe it was weak. We don't want that.We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as themark," he said.

reut2-010.sgm, GERMAN STOCKS SYSTEM SHOULD DEVELOP ALONGSIDE CITY, The German auction system of sharestrading, retaining the business floor, can develop in parallelto off-floor computer trading introduced in London in the "BigBang," Frankfurt stock exchange president Michael Hauck said.    Hauck told a conference that it was unclear if theFrankfurt floor would become superfluous. The Frankfurtexchange did 55 pct of all German securities trading and wasinvesting 86 mln marks in renovating its building. Ascreen-delivered in-house quotation system would soon be inplace too.    The nature of the auction system limited how far tradinghours could be extended from the present two-hour session.    Other practical problems inhibited the German ability tofollow London's moves. Official brokers, who set the prices,were under the control of the Finance Ministry. This meanttransfer of securities control to an independent body, ifdesired, would need legislative changes, Hauck said.    "Shorting" stocks in Germany was also prohibited by the rulesfor pension and insurance funds. They could thus not be lentout for the kind of speculative positions taken by Londonmarket makers.    But Hauck said the system in London could be criticised forbeing too distant from those it should serve. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, WORLD BANK CHIEF URGES MORE JAPANESE INVESTMENT, World Bank President Barber Conablecalled on Japan to boost investment in developing nations, forits own sake as well as that of the world economy.    "Japan has the means to make a major contribution todevelopment in the Third World," he told about 500 Japanesebusinessmen and academics. "I would be pleased with additionalsupport."    With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japancould do more to help assist indebted Third World countriesdevelop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said.    Conable said additional commercial bank investment wouldalso be to Japan's advantage.    It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplusinto Third World economies -- notably those in South America,China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than thosein the developed world, he said.    Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank'sconcessionary lending affiliate, the International DevelopmentAssociation (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand itscontribution to another affiliate, the International Bank forReconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.    Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structuraladjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries toopen their economies more to free competition and trade.    "Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bankloans) in the near future, though maybe not this year," Conabletold Reuters after his speech.

reut2-010.sgm, USSR SEES STRONG FOREIGN INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURES, Soviet officials said foreignbusinessmen are expressing strong interest in establishingjoint enterprises in the Soviet Union and already 30preliminary agreements had been signed with Western firms.    But Western economic experts described foreign businessinterest as cautious and noted that no final contracts had beensealed to set up joint ventures on Soviet territory.    Moscow last year invited companies in socialist, developingand capitalist countries to start joint ventures as part of aprogramme to open up the Soviet Union's foreign trade ties.    At the same time, a number of Soviet ministries andenterprises received the right to deal directly on worldmarkets. Previously the Ministry of Foreign Trade monopolisedall import and export business.    Explaining the changes at a news conference today, DeputyPrime Minister Vladimir Kamentsev said they had received amixed reaction in the foreign press but a warm response frombusinessmen.    Over 200 proposals for establishing joint ventures had beenreceived from foreign firms, 121 of which had been judged ofmutual interest, he said.    Thirty protocols had been signed and 12 projects were"practically implemented," including ventures with Finnish,Japanese, West German and American firms, he added.    But Western diplomats specialising in Soviet economicaffairs said the protocols were not legally binding and not asingle contract had been finalised.    "The Soviet Union is selling the joint venture idea veryhard because it wants to obtain new technology cheaply, but Iwould say business reaction in the West has been cool so far,"commented one diplomat.    Asked why this was so, he said the rules for running jointventures were still unclear and no Western firm wanted to bethe first to take a major financial risk.    Kamentsev, flanked by Foreign Trade Minister Boris Aristov,Foreign Trade Bank Chairman Yuri Ivanov and other officials,repeated terms for the establishment of joint ventures,including the ground-rule that the Soviet side must have astake of at least 51 pct in any enterprise.    He said some businessmen had the mistaken impression thatforeign partners could only take profits from the productswhich their enterprises exported.    "I would like to stress that the foreign partner can takeprofits from all the products which his venture producesaccording to his share of the capital," Kamentsev said.    He added that the Soviet Union was interested in "long-termand stable contacts" with foreign firms and was offering anumber of tax breaks to companies which invested here.    Speaking about the reform giving individual Soviet tradingorganisations more autonomy, Kamentsev said 21 ministries and75 enterprises now had the right to deal for themselves onworld markets.    Organisations enjoying this right handled 25 pct of totalSoviet trade including 40 pct of trade in machines and tools,he said.    The Ministry of Foreign Trade continued to conduct businessfor the remaining ministries and state enterprises andsupervised trade in essential products such as food. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, NAKASONE HARD-PRESSED TO SOOTHE U.S ANGER ON TRADE, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone willvisit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats saidthey believed his chances of success were slim.    Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups andwidespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will behard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.    News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincidedwith news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surpluslast month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.    It also came one day after the Reagan Administration'sEconomic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory actionagainst Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a jointtrade agreement on computer microchips.    Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - onedesigned to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in theshort-term, the other to redirect the country in the mediumterm away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.    But government officials said political infighting couldrob both packages of much of their punch and might even preventone from seeing the light of day.    Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw upa package of short-term economic measures until after its1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that wouldamount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.    But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time forhis trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott byopposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.    Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to theU.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his rulingLiberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its ownmeasures.    He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basisof the government's plans, without losing face in parliamentover the budget, political analysts said.    Officials working on the government's short-term economicpackage said it would probably include interest rate cuts onloans by government corporations, deregulation, measures topass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers inthe form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.    They said a record portion of state investment planned forthe entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the firsthalf, probably over 80 pct.    Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfyReagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American tradedeficit.    To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is alsolikely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-termeconomic plans.    A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japangovernor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a finalreport outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy daysbefore Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.    Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up toMaekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and arelikely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas asagricultural reform and land policy, officials said.    While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailedas possible, they said the political realities might force themto water down some of the committee's recommendations.    A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economymight look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoesmassive restructuring, officials said. The subcommitteeprojects that the current account surplus will fall to lessthan two pct of Japan's total output, or gross nationalproduct, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, whichmeasures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pctof gnp.    The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth forJapan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradualappreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around1993, from 150 now.

The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India,Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China.    Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands incurrent activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade whichpreviously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added.    Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the SovietUnion in the past few days involved Japanese operators sellingThai origin sugar.    Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightenedconsiderably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possiblyfor sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large blockenquiries by China, they said.    Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened toaround 13/14 points under May New York from larger discountspreviously, they added.

It is probable that some1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said.    Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases oftwo to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne costand freight and could be seeking more.

He added the executive Commission has not yet decidedwhether the scheme should become a permanent feature of theEC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farmproduce.    Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter andother food have been authorised for distribution under anoperation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 inwhich charities act as executive Commission agents.    The original idea was to help the needy survive this year'sunusually cold European winter.    The spokesman said the Commission was extending the schemefully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonalsnowstorms, for the month of April.    Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks offood for which they have already applied under the scheme up toApril 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution offlour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high ratenext month.    He said the Commission, which has powers to continue mostaspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further,will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent.

reut2-010.sgm, INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP, India is searching for non-communistcountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit andconserve foreign exchange.    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering andelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, areall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State TradingCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).    "The two state trading corporations are free to use theirbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indianexports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding thatprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.    One trade source said India has targetted countries thatdepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreignimports.    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small partof India's total trading and are likely to account for lessthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in tradeduring the nine months ended December, the sources said.    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the EasternBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps ofagricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crudeoil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,against three billion in 1985/86.    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to helpnarrow the country's large trade deficit, is stillinsignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billionin the current fiscal year.    But the push to include non-communist countries incountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slowgrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promotingcountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were madediscreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannotofficially support bartering.    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron oreexports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.    "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause thatpreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kindfor goods and services sold to India," a trade official said,adding that the policy remains flexible.    "We also take into account other factors such as prices atwhich the goods and services are offered to India," the tradeofficial said.    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreigncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigsand railway equipment to India that they stood a better chanceif they bought Indian goods or services in return, the tradesources said.    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Koreanfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mlndlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. Reuter&#3;

He declined to say how many dollars the bank bought or whenprecisely it intervened.    Swiss foreign exchange dealers described the NationalBank's purchases as modest, perhaps amounting to no more than20 or 30 mln dlrs.    The Bank of France, which was reported buying dollarsagainst the yen in Paris, had made inquiries with Swiss banksas well, and the Bundesbank had also intervened. Bank of Japandollar purchases today were perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 billion dlrs.    Dealers said this tended to confirm the market's impressionthat major industrial countries had agreed at the Paris meetingon an effective floor for the dollar of 148 yen, and the marketseemed ready to test it.    Commercial clients were also selling dollars against theyen as the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 drewcloser. Today's dealings in spot currencies are booked forMarch 31.

The run on the dollar against the yen came in a marketthinned by the absence of many dealers for a Forex Club meetingin Hamburg.

Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens "themilitary readiness of our country is able now to give a veryhard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry outmilitary actions."    He said the activities of the research vessel could beaimed at partitioning the Aegean.    "The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,"General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish GeneralStaff, told a news conference.    He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by anunspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed watersin the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.    Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelledfor members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area.    The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed thestate-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil ininternational waters around three Greek islands off Turkey.     Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areasof the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus.    The latest row erupted when the Greek government said lastmonth that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortiumwhich was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassosand would drill in the same area after the takeover.    Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed agovernment decision that Turkey should protect its interests"because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean inviolation of international agreements."    Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of thevessels, he said "If there is an attack, it is clear what has tobe done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war." But headded "We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by themilitary are directed towards protecting our rights."    Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rightsin the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of thedispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.    Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp toldreporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditionsAthens had attached.    In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if theTurkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations "we willhinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stoppedwith words."    Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert andnavy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesmanYannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only "The Greekfleet is not at its naval base."    Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pctof the areas proposed for research were on the Greekcontinental shelf.    Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a partin orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece tonegotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not acceptit.    Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will notnegotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights inthe Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.    He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not bepossible for Greece to discuss the future of American militarybases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Basesin Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied "Obviously,and perhaps even before the war." REUTER&#3;

H.C.F.Porsche AG &lt;PSHG.F> said it expects to post a satisfactoryprofit in 1986/87, with domestic volume sales seen lower butU.S. Sales anticipated higher.    Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic saleswere expected to fall to 9,000 in the year ending July 31 from11,340 in 1985/86. U.S. Sales should rise to more than 30,000from 28,670 last year.    Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts. Lastmonth the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70mln marks this year from 75.3 mln marks in 1985/86.    For sales, Porsche expects its overall world volume thisyear to be above 50,000. Sales last year stood at 53,254,Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit werebased on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, headded.    The expected drop in West German sales this year would bethe result of the so-called "grey market" for Porsche cars, hesaid. When the dollar was strong against the mark, manyPorsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegalexport to the U.S.    Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.    The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a largerpercentage of overall sales this year than before does not poseproblems for profit, the Porsche board said.    In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same timePorsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.    Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mlnmarks.

"We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but westill have some work to do," producer spokesman Mama Mohammed ofGhana told Reuters after a producers' meeting.    European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumersaccepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted "noproblems" in getting full consumer acceptance.    Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreementtoday, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, theysaid.    The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases fromnon-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total bufferstock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue hasbeen among the most contentious in the rules negotiations.    The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlierproposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegatessaid. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-membercocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted.    Another problem area, delegates said, was the question ofprice differentials for different origins of cocoa bought intothe buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager couldfairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered tohim.    The compromise narrowed the range of differentials betweenthe origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a movesome delegates described as "just fiddling."    But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appeasesome countries that were not satisfied with the originalproposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said.    The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on anyday would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate orforward positions, delegates said.    If the compromise is accepted by the council, mostconsumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effectnext week, or as soon as practically possible.    The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT todiscuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if allparties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meetbefore the council.

reut2-010.sgm, INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS, India is searching for non-communistcountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit andconserve foreign exchange.    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering andelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, areall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State TradingCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).    "The two state trading corporations are free to use theirbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indianexports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding thatprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.    One trade source said India has targetted countries thatdepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreignimports. But countertrade deals still make up only a small partof India's total trading and are likely to account for lessthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in tradeduring the nine months ended December, the sources said.    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the EasternBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps ofagricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crudeoil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87. Reuter&#3;

Commercial Union has had a Euro-commercial paper programsince the autumn of 1985 and a guilder commercial paper programsince January 1986.

One Japaneseinvestor took 50 mln guilders alone, a dealer said.    Later, the bank proposed to allot only 30 pct ofsubscriptions, causing a general outcry among traders. Rabobankfinally gave in to bourse demands to honour all subscriptions.    "We simply did not expect prices to rise so much," a Rabobankspokesman said." Since the pricing, the bond price index hasrisen 0.9 to 117.3, and the average state loan yield has fallenaccordingly to 6.04 pct.    Two weeks ago, Rabobank issued a 250 mln guilder 6.75 pctbond at par, giving it a yield 0.40 above the average bank loanyields that day of 6.35 pct. The issue was heavilyover-subscribed. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, UK MAY REVOKE JAPANESE FINANCIAL LICENSES, The British government may revoke thelicences of selected Japanese banks and securities companiesoperating in London's financial City when they come up forrenewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening upJapan's markets to foreign competition, government sourcessaid.    "We can't say "yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)"but this is definitely being considered," an official said.    His comments came after the government was formally urgedtoday by a cross-section of influential MPs to take jointretaliatory action with the United States against Japan.    Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanesetrade practices. "There's a sense of urgency here now, but theemphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests inJapan," another government official told Reuters.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday thatBritain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in theFinancial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliateagainst countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.    She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.    The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7billion stg, official figures show.    A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged theU.K. Government to "coordinate action with the President of theUnited States, and through the Department of Trade andIndustry, to suspend all further applications from Japanesecommunications companies for equipment approval by the BritishApprovals Board for Telecommunications, and all furtherapplications from Japanese financial institutions for licences"until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called"restrictive conditions" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC)(cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake inJapan's international telecommunications market.    The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-sectionof MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament.Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure onthe Conservative government to take firm action.    Officials said another option now being considered by theU.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japaneseinstitutions. That could be done under the government'sproposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.    58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to dealin London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-basedfirms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.    The new financial services and banking acts offer Britainan alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise deniedunder legally-binding international trade agreements.    "The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and IndustrySecretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging ininvestment, banking and insurance," one official said.    "This point has been made to the Japanese at official levela number times," the official added.    Britain and France are now working together to urge thatthe European Community take collective action against Japan,but by working within EC treaties, another official said.    British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radiointerview that the European Community should build barriersagainst Japanese imports through certification proceduressimilar to those facing European exporters in Japan.    "There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer," hesaid, adding "(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight."Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade"strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have afair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which isitself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of ourown domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness."    The situation is only likely to worsen following news thatJapan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by morethan 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrsfrom 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.    But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visibletrade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.    Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financialinstitutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, ratherthan larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a globalbusiness centre, government sources said. Japan's four largestsecurities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.    In Washington, White House officials said President Reaganwas ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan forbreaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.    There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act onthe recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curbJapanese exports to the United States but officials said themove could come today or early next week.    Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reaganincluded tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports whichuse semiconductors. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - IRISH BUDGET, New Irish Prime Minister CharlesHaughey, faced with a debt-ridden economy, will have to producea harsh budget next week to impress financial markets, appeasepolitical opponents and maintain his tenuous hold on power,analysts said.    For Haughey, who failed to win an overall majority in lastmonth's election, only scraped back into power when the speakerin parliament stepped in with his casting vote to decide a tiedvote on who would be the next Prime Minister.    Heading a minority government and faced with a stagnanteconomy weighed down by debt, he has little room for manoeuvre.    The national debt has now reached 24.3 billion punts --10,000 dlrs for every man, woman and child on the island andper capita three times the size of Mexico's.    Its 19 pct unemployment rate is one of the highest in theEuropean Community and 30,000 youngsters emigrate every year.The 58 pct income tax level could hardly be raised again.    Haughey, declining to be tied down on specifics, promisedon the election trail to get Ireland out of the debt trap withan annual growth rate of 2.5 pct, compared to central bankpredictions of 1.5 pct. Jobs were his top priority, he said.    For his crucial first budget, Haughey has ruled out anyincrease in the level of government borrowing and forecast"widespread cutbacks with severe restrictions right across theboard."    Finance Minister Ray MacSharry also stressed that some ofthe 187,000 civil service jobs must go to trim Ireland's annualpublic wages bill of 2.84 billion punts.    "The big question now is to what extent he will grasp thenettle and cut in next Tuesday's budget," said Kevin Barry,economist with National and City Brokers.    "You have to cut the Exchequer Borrowing Recquirement (EBR)substantially and swiftly. He has to do it now," Barry said.    Noting that last year's EBR was 2.145 billion punts, hesaid "Two billion would be good news. The markets are alreadytaking the view it is going to be tough."    "He has absolutely no room to maneouvre. He cannot spend tostimulate the economy. I don't see any good news in theshort-term."    But he, like other analysts, rules out a debt-servicingcrisis that would mean calling in the International MonetaryFund (IMF). "It's too easy to borrow aboard," he added.    The steady rise of sterling, the currency of one ofIreland's main trading partners, has been a boost to Irishexporters with the country recording a 31 mln punt tradesurplus in February, the 10th surplus in a row.    Political uncertainty is not a major factor for the puntbecause the main political parties are all essentiallyconservative with no major economic policy switches expected.    New Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, who replaced ousted PrimeMinister Garret Fitzgerald at the head of the main oppositionparty, has pledged to back Haughey's budget if, as expected, hegets tough.    Haughey is four short of an overall majority and would haveto rely on the support of independent deputies if all fouropposition parties united to vote against him.    But in today's climate of economic austerity, fewpoliticians would risk returning to the polls so soon andHaughey could cling to power for at least another two years ifhe brings in a belt-tightening budget next week, politicalcommentators say.    The debt-laden economy is the great national preoccupation,pushing firmly into the background for now Haughey's ultimatedream of a united Ireland with the British out of the north.    H.J. Heinz chairman Tony O'Reilly, one of the mostsuccessful Irishmen in international business, stressed theneed for a frontal attack on the national debt, arguing "many ofour children have lost faith in the future."    "Were there to be an uptick in world interest rates or aprecipitous decline in our parities, the effect on our economyand on the provision of services by our government would becatastrophic," he said.    This island of 3.5 mln people has been living beyond itsmeans with a state spending spree on welfare benefits thatcould not be financed by economic growth. REUTER&#3;
reut2-010.sgm, LOWER ASCS CORN PRICES TO AFFECT TEN STATES, The Agriculture Department'swidening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect countyposted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDAofficial said.    All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will countieswhich use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana,Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabamaand Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of CommodityOperations Division for the USDA.    USDA last night notified the grain industry that effectiveimmediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior cornwould be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts,depending on what the differential is.    USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high postedcounty prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.    "We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for amonth, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in anynearby time," Burgess said.    Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulfdifferentials when and if Gulf prices recede. "If we're off themark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off themark if we're too low?" he said.    While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall,Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are beingplanned right now.    "We don't tinker. We don't make changes lightly, and wedon't make changes often," he said. Reuter&#3;

U.S. officials said the United States did not specify whichsupercomputer it was willing to sell but had offered India achoice.    They declined to comment on a newspaper report that theUnited States wanted to sell India a computer less powerfulthan the Indians had sought.    They said the United States was awaiting a response fromNew Delhi.    The New York Times, quoting unnamed government and industryofficials, said the United States wanted to sell a weaker-modelsupercomputer to India.    U.S. and Indian negotiatiors reached a tentative agreementin December on security precautions for the sale of thecomputer, which has a wide variety of military applications.    "We have told the Indians that we ratify the tentativeagreement reached in December," a U.S. official said.    India proposed to use the supercomputer to analyze weatherpatterns to forecast monsoons.    The sale of a U.S. supercomputer to a non-Western nation israre. This transaction was seen as a test of atechnology-sharing agreement signed by Prime Minister RajivGandhi and President Reagan in 1985.    The American concern was that the advanced technology mightfall into the hands of the Soviet Union, which is India's mainweapons supplier.    One condition calls for U.S. personnel to service thecomputer in India for three years, a Pentagon spokesman said.    The spokesman predicted the negotiations, which alsoinvolved the State Department, could be quickly resolved.    The only countries which make the supercomputer are theUnited States and Japan.

The company added that it expects first quarter 1987earnings to be "down moderately" from year-earlier levels.    "Continued suspension of interest payments on the medium-and long-term debt could result in such loans being classifiedas nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual," it said.

Brazil announced Feb. 20 that it was temporarily suspendinginterest payments on all its medium- and long-term foreign bankdebt.

The accord was signed here yesterday by Nigerian FinanceMinister Chu Okongwu and senior French Treasury officials aftertalks with CoFACE, the French export credit agency, they said.    The agreement came after a similar agreement with Britainthis week and follows an accord between Nigeria and the ParisClub of western creditor governments in December to reschedulesome 7.5 billion dlrs of official debt.    The Paris Club multilateral agreement concerned medium andlong-term debt due between September 1986 and end-1987 over 10years with five years grace.    As with all Paris Club rescheduling accords, specificinterest rates and other details have to be negotiated on abilateral basis with the creditor countries involved. Nodetails of the discussions here were immediately available.    The agreement signed on Tuesday with Britain's ExportCredits Guarantee Department was the first in Nigeria's tour ofcreditor nations. Okongwu left Paris today for London and isdue back in Nigeria on Monday, diplomatic sources said.    Nigeria is hoping that further bilateral accords can beconcluded soon as this could encourage official export creditagencies to renew insurance cover for exports to Nigeria.    CoFACE suspended its cover for medium and long-term exportcontracts with Nigeria in 1983, but maintained its cover forcurrent trade deals involving consumer goods with six-monthcredit periods, CoFACE sources said.    "We have an open position regarding Nigeria," the sourcessaid, adding that it was for French Finance Minister EdouardBalladur to decide whether to renew full insurance cover.    Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh exportcredits this year from official agencies under a structuraladjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank toreschedule part of the country's 19 billion dlr foreign debt.    But these credits cannot be approved until the exportcredit agencies agree to resume insuring the credits.    French exports to Nigeria were 3.42 billion francs in 1986,down from 4.94 billion in 1985, while Nigeria's exports toFrance were 5.63 billion francs in 1986, down from 15.33billion in 1985.

reut2-010.sgm, SOUTH AFRICA GDP UP 4.7 PCT IN 1986 LAST QUARTER, The South African Reserve Bank,confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic productin the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annualrate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pctin the 1985 final quarter.    The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominalgrowth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a1.5 pct contraction in 1985.    But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade istaken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pctcompared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.    GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by aneconomy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes suchpayments or outflows.    The bank also said there were indications the country'seconomic recovery was becoming more broadly based.    With the exception of commerce all major sectors of theeconomy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domesticproduction.    The bank said major increases in foreign reserves wererecorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987.Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.    Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the totalannual value of import payments.    The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion randin 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.    The bank said continuing strength of the current accounthas allowed foreign reserves to be "rebuilt to more comfortablelevels."    "This has strengthened the authorities' hands in lendingsupport to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were tobe called for," the bank said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, ANALYSTS PEG U.S. COTTON SEEDINGS 10.6 MLN ACRES, U.S. cotton farmers are likely toplant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on anaverage of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearingup for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 plantingintentions report next Tuesday.    The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpseof what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, whichbegins August 1.    Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to10.9 mln acres.    On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cottonfarmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres.    Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acreshad been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.    Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's gooddemand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analystssaid those factors make cotton a profitable crop.    "With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there isgoing to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.Soybeans are dirt cheap," said Lisbeth Keefe of CargillInvestor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cottonmarket specialists.    Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead toincreased acreage, analysts said.    They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmerswho used part of their crop as collateral for government loanswere not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton ingovernment warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the governmentwill not pick up the tab for storage.    Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers fromparticipating in the program, which could result in morecotton. "The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of25 pct of a farmer's base acreage," noted Judy Weissman ofShearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not toparticipate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have.    Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yieldingWestern states would be most likely to steer clear of theprogram. "Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct," saidone commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in parton forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during itsannual meeting in late January.    But others disagreed. "I think some Western growers havedecided they should be in the program for security reasons.There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed thegovernment's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside theprogram is subject to the wiles of the market," said WalterBrown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.    Some cotton specialists said their expectations forincreased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's plantingintentions report. "Anything the USDA is announcing now isbased on information they gathered before their cotton programwas announced (on March 20)," one analyst cautioned. She saidtraders will get a better idea of next year's cotton outputwhen the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9.    Brown took that opinion a step further. "I don't thinkplanted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonmentrate," the difference between acreage planted and acreageharvested.    Brown said the abandonment rate this year was "pretty high"at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producingstates. "More normal would be about six pct," he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, TALKING POINT/GOLD, The price of gold bullion and shareprices of North American gold stocks are benefiting fromcontinued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said.    "There's been a tug of war between the (currency)speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and itlooks like the game has gone to the speculators," said John Ingat Maison Placements Canada Inc.    The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows todayagainst the Japanese yen despite buying by several centralbanks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said.    A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is thetraditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted.    Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd,noted that "a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars.If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold."    A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ingsaid, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to afour pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct.    Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from itscurrent level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees anaverage price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, MichaelPickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs,with a possible spike above 500 dlrs.    However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen farfaster in recent months than the price of the metal itself,causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewherein the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no signthe buying pressure is slowing down. "The stocks have run anincredible way," Cohen said.    On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd &lt;ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2,Campbell Red Lake Mines &lt;CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold&lt;NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4.

Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pctsince December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion hasincreased six pct. "Canadian golds have been the top performingindex this year," he noted.    In the U.S., there is "too much money chasing too fewstocks," Pickens said. And many investing institutions such aspension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash,he added.

reut2-010.sgm, U.S. PRICE DATA SUGGEST MODERATE INFLATION, Latest consumer price data indicateU.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will beabove last year's pace, economists said.    "Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this timelast year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,"said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.    U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer priceindex for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced amore moderate 1.9 pct last month.    The CPI came within the range of economists' expectationsand had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.    Among the key components of the report, transportationprices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gainreflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels anddeclines in new car prices and finance charges.    "There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,"said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Economists said the latest CPI supports existingexpectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.    The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.    Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as aresult of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energycomponent warrant attention in case gains in these areas becomefactored into the wider economic picture.    "As long as those price rises do not become entrenched incost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thusreducing international competitiveness, then the FederalReserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pctinflation," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G.

TPA, a bio-engineered blood-clot dissolving drug whichGenentech hopes to market under the name Activase, will bereviewed by the FDA's cardiorenal advisory committee during thepanel's May 28-29 meeting, the sources said.    Neither Genentech nor the FDA would confirm that a secondreview of the drug had been set.    "It's under consideration for the May 28-29 meeting," an FDAofficial said. "It's on a draft agenda."    Similarly, a Genentech spokeswoman said the FDA had not yetnotified it of the second advisory committee review.    "We know it's a possibility, but as of this minute, we can'tconfirm that we are on the agenda," she said.    The spokeswoman said a second review had "always been apossibility." But she declined to say how the review wouldaffect marketing plans before receiving official FDA word.    The spokeswoman acknowledged that rumors of a second FDAcommittee review had buffeted Genentech's stock yesterday onWall Street. The stock fell 2.75 dlrs a share to clsoe at 61.75dlrs.    TPA stands for tissue plasminogen activator, and would beused on heart attack victims to clear blockage in a vein orartery. Though other blood clot dissolvers are on the market,TPA is said to be more effective and with fewer side effects.    Analysts have projected the worldwide market for the drugat as high as 1.5 billion dlrs a year.    Stuart Weisbrod, a biotechnology analyst with PrudentialBache Securities Inc., told Reuters the additional FDA reviewlikely would keep TPA off the market until at least November.    Approval had been expected this spring.    He said the FDA action prompted him to cut his estimate ofGenentech's 1987 earnings to about 40 cents a share from hisearlier projection of 67 cents a share.    He said the delay would lower Genentech's 1987 revenuesfrom TPA to about five to six mln dlrs compared to an earlierprojection of 50 to 60 mln dlrs of 1987 revenues. Reuter&#3;

Manila wants to reschedule about 3.6 billion dlrs of debtthat falls due between 1987 and 1992 and to obtain easier termson 5.8 billion dlrs of previously restructured debt.    The talks have dragged on because of the banks' reluctanceto accept interest payments partly in Philippine InvestmentNotes, PINs, instead of cash and because of Manila's insistenceon an interest rate margin close to the 5/8 pct spread overEurocurrency rates that it initially demanded.

reut2-010.sgm, COLD AIR A THREAT TO SOME U.S. HARD WHEAT AREAS, A cold air mass working its waysouth from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard redwinter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheatspecialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.    "There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough alongso that it's probably vulnerable," Krenzler said.    Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air movingfrom the north could put temperatures in the middle 20'sfahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of alow pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall thesystem.    If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hitOklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperaturescould stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.    Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crophas advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the morevulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.    "We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26degrees (fahrenheit)," Krenzler said, "as long as we don't havea lot of wind."    "If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say wehave a good chance of significant damage to the heads," hesaid.    Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central andsouthwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developedand have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.

reut2-010.sgm, CME PROPOSES LIMITS ON BROKER TRADING RINGS, The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)has proposed stringent limits on the portion of futures tradingthat can be conducted between "trading rings," or  affiliatedgroups of floor brokers, according to a CME spokesman.    Violators would be subject to fines of as much as 50,000dlrs, the exchange said in a letter distributed to its membersearlier this week.    The proposal is one of the reforms the exchange's Board ofGovernors suggested to curb practices that have come under firefor unfairly limiting competition on the floor. Local tradersclaim that trading among broker "rings" violates theopen-outcry system prevailing in the futures markets.    Limits on ring trading would be applied floor-wide underthe proposal. The other reforms, which address dual trading,would apply only to the Standard and Poor's 500 stock indexfutures pit.    A debate over dual trading, the practice of trading forone's own account and filling customer orders, has arisenbecause many traders believe it can create a climate fortrading abuses, especially in the extremely volatile stockindex futures pit.    Adoption of the Board of Governors' reforms hinges on anApril 13 vote of CME members on a membership petition, signedby several hundred members in February, that would bar all dualtrading at the exchange.    Defeat of the petition is likely, according to a floorbroker contacted by Reuters, who also said he welcomed thelimits on the "ring" traders. If members reject the petition,that would open up the way for the Board of Governors' reforms.    CME President William Brodsky said the need to curb brokergroup trading has grown "as the groups have gotten larger." "Alot of the individuals were losing business because they werefaced with a large-scale competition. The Board began studyingthe problem about six months ago.    Under the proposed reforms, members of a broker rings --defined as brokers who share brokerage fees, revenues,expenses, a deck of customer orders or employee salary expenses-- would be barred from trading more than 15 pct of theirpersonal trades with each other. Those found in violation wouldbe subject to fines of up to 50,000 dlrs.    Broker ring members would also be prohibited from tradingmore than 25 pct of customer orders with each other. Fines ofup to 10,000 dlrs would be levied on violators.    More stringent limits were proposed on individual tradingthan customer orders because "we don't want to negativelyimpact customer orders," Brodsky said. "On the other hand, theneed to do a personal order is very different."    Broker associations would also be limited to having no morethan one member serving on an exchange disciplinary or pitcommittee. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE, The London Metal Exchange's, LME,decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract,with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is apositive move, physical traders and LME dealers said.    Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimumpurity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1,1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pctcontract.    This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-Europeandelivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking atSingapore as a delivery point for other contracts.    Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform withexisting industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-meltmaterial, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded.    The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positivemove by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian andJapanese traders, who would be able to place metal on towarrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said.    Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simplerwith a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almostexclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to bedone during the sterling rings, they added.    LME ring dealers said the new contract would match moreclosely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of therecent wide backwardations.    Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pctpurity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloccountries, such as Romania.    The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declinedas an exporter recently, they said.    Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer fromliquidity problems initially, as business may continue tocentre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, wherethere are many holders of large short positions on the LME.    But others said the new contract would soon attract tradinginterest, given that much 99.70 metal has already beenattracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.    The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for anew contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, wherehigh grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, theysaid.    Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract willeventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Likestandard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the processin this case may take longer, they added.    Forming a new contract and establishing a Singaporewarehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,which make physical trading difficult, would not totallydisappear as a result, the trade sources said.    These premiums for prompt metal have become asemi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increasedbusiness and volatility in traded options, and are presentlyaround 50 stg.    Increasingly large granting of option positions has beentaking place. When some of these are declared and exercised atthe end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezesaround these dates are commonplace, they said.    Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Easternoperators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead ofhaving to cover.    But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, eventhough the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between thedeclaration and prompt dates.    These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of themonth, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.    Backwardations will remain while operators continue togrant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceedsaluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, TALKING POINT/FOOD STOCKS, Fueled by an earnings-driven bullmarket, food stocks are emerging as the big winners, analystssay.    "This is an earnings-driven market, and the investor ishoming in on stocks that have visible and predictable earningsgrowth," E.F. Hutton food analyst June Page said.    The food group, whose stocks have underperformed since thebeginning of the year after about five years of growth, seemsto have turned around, DLJ Securities analyst William Leachagreed.    The fundamentals remain favorable and may even be enhancedby the effects of tax reform for companies such as Sara LeeCorp &lt;SLE>, Quaker Oats Co &lt;OAT>, and General Mills Inc &lt;GIS>,Page said. These and other food companies are recommended asaggressive buys on a selective basis by most brokerage housessurveyed.    The current economy provides an environment of stableinflation, interest rates and energy costs, which gives foodcompanies the flexibility to expand profit margins over aperiod of time, Page said. Lower commodity costs allow forfurther price flexibility, she added.    Another plus is that increases in labor and packaging inthe food industry have been minimal, she noted.    For 1987, Page said E.F. Hutton sees inflation holdingunder four pct, oil prices stabilizing at 17 to 18 dlrs abarrel and interest rates remaining at current levels.    As a result of new production facilities featuringsophisticated technology "companies now have a lower breakevenpoint because they have enhanced productivity and loweroverhead costs," she said.

reut2-010.sgm, TAIWAN TO STUDY SUSPENDING FOREX CONTROLS, Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financialofficials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchangecontrols and study the possibility of suspending the controls,a cabinet statement said.    The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy andCentral Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduceTaiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached arecord 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month.    Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministryand the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to easethe controls, but he did not give details.    Yu said the government could maintain the framework of theforeign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. Thecontrols would be used during emergency.    Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its tradesurplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billionin 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's tradewith the United States, according to official figures.    But he said that while easing the controls would helpreduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in ashort time.    Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted fromgrowing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largesttrading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports.    Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, toldReuters: "The decision came a little bit late. But it was betterthan never."    Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, saidthe government should rapidly relax its foreign exchangecontrols and open its market wider to help balance trade withits trading partners, especially the United States.    "The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchangecontrols will not only help our trading partners, but also helpour own economic problems," he said.    He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boostTaiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February. REUTER&#3;
reut2-010.sgm, TEST HITCH INTERRUPTS ARIANE MOTOR TRIALS, An error interrupted testing of an Arianerocket third stage starter motor on Monday but there should belittle or no delay in the launch program, Arianespace said.    A joint statement from the European Arianespace consortiumand the motor manufacturer Societe Europeenne de Propulsion(SEP) said that to avoid any risk, the motor had beendismantled and could not be used in the next launch.    It had immediately been replaced by another motor and newtests had begun today.    "In these conditions, the flight V19 remains scheduledbefore the end of June," the statement said.    Ariane launches have been suspended since an ignitionfailure in the third stage motor last May forced controllers toblow up a rocket in flight.    SEP has been carrying out a series of nearly 50simulated-altitude tests on the redesigned starter at itstightly guarded plant in the town of Vernon, 80 km northwest ofParis.    The Arianespace-SEP statement said that during a test onMarch 23, a fault in the preparation of the altitude simulationchamber meant a component of the motor came under abnormalpressure.    Arianespace originally hoped to resume launches by Februarythis year, but a longer-than-expected test program on the newstarter motor forced postponement of the next launch.    The total orderbook of outstanding launches for the13-member European Space Agency's Ariane rockets runs to morethan 40 satellites and is worth more than two billion dlrs.    The Ariane program is the main rival to the United States'NASA agency in the lucrative satellite launch market. Itsorders have sharply increased largely as a result of the U.S.Space shuttle disaster in January 1986. REUTER&#3;

Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) ChairmanShoichi Saba stated: "EIAJ believes that it is premature andeven irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of theagreement and our efforts to comply with it only six monthsafter concluding the agreement."    "We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider thedecision made, to evaluate fairly the results of Japaneseefforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement, and toresist emotional biases," he said.    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to slap as much as300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation forwhat is sees as Japan's failure to comply with the terms of thepact.    The agreement, struck late last year after months of heatednegotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chipson world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.    To salvage the pact, Tokyo has instructed its chip makersto slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateralorganisation designed to promote chip imports.    Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged threemln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation andexpressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join.    "This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers maynot be really interested in participating in the Japanesemarket," he said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, U.S. BANKER PREDICTS FURTHER DOLLAR FALL THIS YEAR, A leading U.S. Banker said the dollarwas likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and animprovement in the huge American trade deficit would be onlytemporary at current world exchange rate levels.    Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of &lt;Morgan GuarantyTrust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that thesteady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough torein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis.    Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the InterarabCambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached lastmonth among major industrial nations to steady the dollararound current levels left many questions unanswered.    "I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in thedollar," Viermetz said. "I believe there is room for a furtherfall of five to 10 per cent in 1987."    The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, GreatBritain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late Februaryto stabilise major currencies around current levels.    The accord came after months of transatlantic argument,with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking thedollar lower had made life impossible for West German andJapanese exporters.    The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continuedslide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York inSeptember 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress thevalue of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances.    But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showedthat with no further change in exchange rates -- and continuedsluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Tradedeficit would improve only temporarily.    He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs thisyear from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160billion dlrs.    "This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authoritiesand politicians in Washington," he said.    Viermetz said it was only natural that markets shouldattempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struckwhen the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen.    Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or"Plaza Accord," the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240yen.    Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted tosee the dollar hold within a "loose range" of 1.75 to 1.90 marksand 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currencylower being countered by central bank intervention.    The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen --its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40years. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.    Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal fundsrate falling below six pct for fear of provoking anuncontrolled fall in the dollar.    But at the same time, worries about the international debtcrisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.    The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings togethermore than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arabworld and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.    Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred onthe role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankersurging them to adapt to a new global trend towardssecuritisation of  business.

Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference thebank would continue to take measures to defend the currency.    But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for itswar-battered economy now more than ever before. "We expect acommon effort between the central bank and Arab central banksand monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support andpreserve the value of the currency when needed," he said.    Twelve years of civil war have devastated productivesectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade andbudget deficits.    Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded inreducing demand for imports and increasing exports. "These areencouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet," he said.    "We believe that with a just political solution acceptableto all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit theLebanese pound and Lebanon."    In the meantime, he said the central bank had four maingoals:    1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit    2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bankfinancing institutions in financing the deficit    3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreigncurrency deposits    4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks.

"Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations byexplaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points thatneed to be corrected," he was quoted by Kyodo News Service assaying.    While expressing regret over America's decision to imposetariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone saidTokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washingtonto help settle the dispute.    Government officials said Japan would make a formal requestnext week for emergency talks and that the two sides wouldprobably meet the week after, just days before the April 17deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.    Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japaninvestigation of American claims that Japanese companies aredumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.    Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronicgoods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure tolive up to their bilateral chip pact.    That agreement, hammered out late last year after months ofheated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-pricechips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips.    Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatorythan those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,who earlier today said Japan was ready to take "appropriatemeasures" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions.    Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura'sremark and said that his main message was that the two sidesneed to talk urgently about the issue.    But they admitted that Japan was considering taking theUnited States to GATT, the Geneva-based internationalorganization which polices world trade, if Washington imposedthe tariffs.    Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), theysaid. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panelto consider the legality of the U.S. Action.    But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. "Itmay be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the UnitedStates may lift its decision at an early date," Tamura said.    In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, PresidentRonald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he hadevidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in worldmarkets and had opened up its own market to imports.    Japanese government officials said they are confident theycan make the pact work.    They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chipsthrough unregulated distributors has all but dried up afterMITI instructed domestic makers to cut output.    While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japaneseimports of American chips, MITI officials said that theministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens.    The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,some of whom are also leading producers, to step up theirpurchases of foreign semiconductors.    A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>said his firm would do just that and could announce its plansin the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies todo likewise.

"In the same way it has been understood that Greece willalso not undertake oil activities outside its territorialwaters," the statement added.    An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said ForeignMinister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage indialogue over the dispute. It was impossible to resolve thedispute by crises, he was quoted as saying.    "We call on Greece to come and engage in a dialogue with us- let us find a solution as two neighbours and allies should,"he said.    The radio said Halefoglu had briefed the leaders of anumber of the country"s political parties on the latestdevelopments.    Turkey sent the survey ship Sismik 1 into the Aegeanyesterday, flanked by warships, to press its case but havingearlier said it would go into disputed waters, declared thevessel would stay in Turkish areas.    Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, in London on his way home afterheart surgery in the United States, is expected to receive anecstatic welcome from thousands of Turks when he returns today.    He was in defiant mood last night, telling Turkish radio:"We can never accept that Greece should confine us to theAnatolian continent. If there are riches under the sea, theyare for mankind."    Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officialsacknowledged that the underlying dispute over delimiting thecontinental shelf in the Aegean remained unsolved.    Turkey alleged that the consortium"s plans would haveinfringed the 1976 Berne agreement between the two countries,which called for a moratorium on any activities until thedelimitation was agreed. Greece earlier this month declared itconsiders the accord inoperative. REUTER&#3;
reut2-010.sgm, CHINA HELPS IRAN TO DEVELOP NEW MISSILES - PAPER, Iran has produced a short-rangesurface-to-surface missile with technological help from Chinaand is working with Peking on a longer-range missile capable ofhitting most areas of Iraq, the Observer newspaper said.    The British Sunday paper, quoting Iranian sources, said theshorter-range missile was based on a Chinese version of theSoviet-made Frog and had been fired at the Iraqi port of Basra.The missile has a range of 40 miles.    The other type, similar to the Soviet army"s Scud B with arange of 180 miles, is at an advanced stage of development,according to the Observer.    The development of a longer-range weapon would enable Iranto strike at many towns and cities on the territory of itsrelatively small neighbour.    Earlier this month, Iran acknowledged it had acquiredChinese-made Silkworm missiles capable of hitting tankerscarrying crude oil from Arab countries to the West.    Iran said it would use its Silkworm anti-ship missileagainst shipping in the waterway only if Iraqi air and missileraids prevented it from exporting oil.    The Silkworms are large mobile missiles with a range of 60miles, which can carry a warhead of 1,000 pounds. REUTER&#3;

A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened totackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea keptto Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potentialclash.    Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefingopposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.    The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request toWashington to close down its telecommunications base at NeaMakri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which hadprompted it to make the request were no longer valid.    Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece hasthe right to ask for suspension of operations at times when itsnational interests are threatened.    The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it wouldsearch for oil round three Greek islands off its coastfollowing an announcement from Greece that it planned to drilleast of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-ledoil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.    Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreementunder which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in theAegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled.Athens says it considers the accord inactive.    The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it hadreceived an assurance from Greece that it would not carry outoil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declinedcomment on the statement.    Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take thelong-standing continental shelf dispute to the InternationalCourt of Justice at The Hague.    Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis saidhe had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO GeneralSecretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES, The Emirates Industrial Bank haspredicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab statesfollowing higher oil revenues.    A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, saidtotal oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from33.5 billion in 1986.    The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabiaand the United Arab Emirates (UAE).    The bank said the improvement would result from higher oilprices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrainoverall group production.    These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eightdollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.    "All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery inthe economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expectedgrowth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,"the study said.    It added, however, that GCC states would experience higherbudget deficits this year because of needs arising from pastrecession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.    The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would riseto 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.    It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combinedtrade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in1985.    The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic productto 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, itadded. REUTER&#3;

Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of anArab currency traders meeting: "We have to start withcoordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a commonsystem of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to goyet."    He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be aplausible project.    The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- SaudiArabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United ArabEmirates --  have held a series of meetings this year toexamine linking their currencies to a single peg in a systemwhich bankers say could be modelled on the European MonetarySystem (EMS).    At present, five currencies are linked either officially orin practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar ispegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.    A common currency system or EMS-style "grid" would, intheory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stableexchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at avery low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remainsmall. "Capital markets in the Arab world are still in theirinfancy," he said.    Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, apaucity of financial instruments and a legal framework thatoften does not recognise the western banking concept ofinterest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.

"It is not enough for us torely totally on our own funds and capital (to achieve itsmodernisation). We have to have the courageous spirit to borrowa certain amount of foreign loans," he said.

Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuencawas in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)executive board producer members after a meeting last weekendin Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers todiscuss the fall in coffee prices.    London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.    Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failedto agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results onLatin America, both economically and politically.    He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers topave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.    Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices underan International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year agowhen prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.    Central American economic ministers have estimated theregion will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,Martinez said.

reut2-010.sgm, TOKYO BIDS TO STOP CHIP ROW TURNING INTO TRADE WAR, Japan is seeking to prevent its computerchips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scaletrade war, government officials said.    "We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't havean adverse effect on our overall relationship with the UnitedStates," a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)official said.     On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo'salleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.    That agreement, reached last year after heatednegotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chipsin world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.    Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate thefall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at theend of April.    While Japan has already done about all it can to make surethe chip pact is working, the government is studying measuresit can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensurethe trip's success, they said.    "The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,"one official told Reuters. "We would very much like to dosomething to respond to that."    In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute fromspreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict theU.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductormakers, not to the government.    Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and anangry American Congress, the Japanese government has beenforced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductordispute, trade analysts said.    They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largestchip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as thedraconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,included enforced production cuts.    The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to theannouncement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficultiesthe government faces in taking further action.    "Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with theU.S./Japan agreement," said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of theElectronic Industries Association of Japan.    He accused the U.S. Of being "irrational." He said the U.S.Action had made the bilateral chip pact "meaningless."    Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the disputethrough consultations.    Japan is expected to send a high-level official toWashington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not togo ahead with the tariffs on April 17.    Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industryplans to step up purchases of U.S. Chips and to propose a jointinvestigation into Washington's allegations of chip dumping. REUTER&#3;

"The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade wardidn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperationon terrorism," one U.S. Official told Reuters.    "It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,more harmonious than usual."    Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged todeal with a series of potentially serious disputes with theUnited States.    During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets inLibya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take acircuitous route. That angered Washington.    The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said ayear ago Washington felt the French were not taking strongenough action against terrorism. "Now they are. We're pleasedand they are pleased that we are pleased," one said.    More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grainmarkets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the EuropeanCommunity  threatened to become a trade war.    In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberateCommunity moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States waspoised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community foodimports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.    Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored amajor success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last basesin northern Chad.    A French official added: "There is also a common interest ingetting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of theworld by opening up its markets."    Although relations have improved markedly between the twocountries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is theCommunity's common agricultural policy (CAP).    To Washington, as one official put it, "CAP is the root ofall evil" in international food trade because it subsidisesfarmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below worldprices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

But total operating and extraordinary profits, includingearnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's ownaccount and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said.    BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB'scapital increase, which is to finance the insurance company'sacquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.    Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid anunchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred anunchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,&lt;Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from whichAMB has acquired the majority stake.    The bank has said its business last year suffered from theturbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housingconcern Neue Heimat.    AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.    The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in theinterest margin to 1.9 pct.    A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.    The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step uprisk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasisedbecause of the continuing difficulties of some countries.    Disclosed risk provisions, which under West Germanaccounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.    BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in1986 from 33.51 billion.

The current practice of filing tax redemption claims istime consuming, they said.    Securities houses here have had difficulty sellingsix-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseasgovernments and central banks because of the tax system and theBank of Japan's book entry system, which demands the accountsbe kept with the houses rather than by the Bank.    Tankoku, introduced in February 1986, were designed as akey short-term instrument to promote internationalization ofthe yen. But since the introduction of a complicated book-entrysystem for bill purchases in January 1986, foreign governmentsand central banks have shied away from buying the bills, thesources said.

As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investmentsgrit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidthere was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.    The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings byboth sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.    The document was prepared by a private committee formed byPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank ofJapan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop frictiondue to its large trade surpluses, Japan must "make a historicaltransformation in its traditional policies on economicmanagement and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no furtherdevelopment for Japan without this transformation."    Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and havelooked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But theJapanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium termprospects of totally transforming their economic habits.    The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japaneseprevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended toraise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports tothe U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateralsemiconductor pact.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened toblock Japanese financial firms from London after the Japaneseplaced what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bidby British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestictelecommunications joint venture.    On Friday, European currency dealers said European centralbanks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, mightleave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.    Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business groupKeidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictoryviews last November when he visited the European Community."Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that Ifound to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europewas the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in theresults of the Maekawa report," he said.    "We explained that the process of restructuring the economyaway from its dependence on exports toward a balance betweendomestic and external demand...Would take time," Saito said.    Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC IndustrialPolicy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said "Ionly know that your government, under the leadership ofMaekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a lessoutward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawareport which has attracted the most attention in Europe."    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. "A far betteranswer than protectionism would be structural change within theJapanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. Andwe hope to see changes occur in the near future," visitingChairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly thefault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea ofchange in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC businessleaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the tradeproblem.    "We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of theMaekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.    "The important implication of the Maekawa report is that itis finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of theirlabour," said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director ofShearson Lehman Brothers.    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report asfast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelledthe country asking about this issue.    He said People mentioned many things in line with thespirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal andsteel industries.    A major misunderstanding is that the private report wasgovernment policy. Europeans are confused about this,underlined by von Moltke's reference to the "leadership" of theMaekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to lastSeptember's government programme of new economic measures."Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point outthat the government has put its signature to a programmedesigned to implement the report," the ambassador said.

Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge incrude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.    But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as tellingPresident Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct inthe financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct theprevious year.    Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said,although he did not give complete figures.    The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to generalelections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.    Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of theappreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark againstthe dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments.    He said the economy would have suffered more from the worldeconomic recession if the government had not devalued therupiah by 31 pct last September.    In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Postsaid the government must press ahead with measures toderegulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.

reut2-010.sgm, JAPAN HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE, The Japanese government appears to havelittle new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Overcomputer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.    The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., Inretaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on themicrochip trade signed last September.    A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters "Japan has donewhat it can, and now we must persuade the United States to waitfor those steps to take effect."    The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the Septemberagreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost innon-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.     Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cutproduction in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold inthird countries at non-regulated prices.    "I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has," saidJardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.    A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to callfor production cuts beyond those already sought, although itwould continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.    Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said theywould consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a MatsushitaElectric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase inimports was not likely.    Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit ifthe United States did implement the tariffs, which would belevied on consumer electronics products rather than onmicrochips themselves.    "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,"said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.    "The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to bestopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will bedelayed for another year," he said.    Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry bystepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japanfor semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.    "The American approach is full of contradictions," JardineFleming's Edwards said.    "If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing theywant to do is hit the makers of the final products because thathurts the final market," Edwards said.    But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but alsofrustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analystsargued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may haveto take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.    Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,said "The major overall issue is to stimulate the domesticeconomy and move away from an export-dependent economy." REUTER&#3;

After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yenfrom an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finishof 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering,they said.    "I think (Nakasone's) desperate," said a U.S. Bank foreignexchange manager.    Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliamentthat Japan and other industrialized nations committedthemselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above150 yen.    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committeethat the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. AndWest Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollarfell below 150 yen.

reut2-010.sgm, JAPANESE KEEN TO ENTER GERMAN PRIMARY BOND MARKET, Japanese securities houses and banksare eager to enter the market for lead-management of markeurobonds when the ban on Japanese institutions is lifted, butthe entry may be difficult, Japanese bankers said.    Most Japanese securities houses and banks established heresaid they have concrete plans to enter lead-managementbusiness, as soon as terms are cleared, probably this year.    Japan's largest bank, The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd, is alsoconsidering expanding its business here, bankers said.    Japanese banks were excluded from lead management of markeurobonds when the Bundesbank opened that market to foreignbanks in May 1985, due to the lack of reciprocity for Germanbanks in the Japanese market.    Last year, the Japanese began a slow opening by grantingWest German banks investment licences.    Pressure on Tokyo stepped up last week when U.K. Governmentsources said Britain may revoke the licences of some Japanesebanks and securities firms operating in London when they comeup for renewal if progress is not made towards opening Japan'smarkets to foreign competition.    A spokesman for the Dai-Ichi Kangyo representative officehere said the bank was naturally considering options such asexpanding its mark securities trading operations to Frankfurt.    Sources at the bank's London branch said the bank wasalready seriously planning such a move.    Expanding secondary operations would also improve theplacement capacity of Japanese houses intending to move intolead management of mark eurobonds.    But even Japanese banks already established in secondarymarkets here face a host of problems in lead management. One isfinding borrowers.    One banker at Nikko Securities Co Ltd's The NikkoSecurities Co (Deutschland) GmbH said the cost of mark issuesmay be too high for some Japanese firms.    "For the moment, for Japanese borrowers, marks areexpensive," he said. Many prefer Swiss francs or eurodollars.    A Japanese borrower with a five-year equity warranteurodollar bond issued at 2-1/2 pct can now swap into domesticyen rates of one pct. But mark swap opportunities are limited.    In addition, many Japanese companies are committed alreadyto large German banks.    To avoid souring relations with German banks they nowcooperate with, Japanese houses may prefer finding borrowers sofar not seen in the mark sector.    Names may include Sanyo Electric Co Ltd and NishimatsuConstruction Co Ltd, which both count Yamaichi Securities CoLtd as their house bank, or Hokkaido Electric Power Co Inc,which recently gave a presentation here with the IndustrialBank of Japan's unit here.    Japanese banks are also faced with finding local personnel,which is not easy. "They are definitely going to have a manpowerproblem," one Swiss banker said.    Swiss and American banks had no trouble attracting topGerman managers. But Japanese cultural differences will beharder for Germans to overcome. Success may depend on whetherJapanese parents allow German subsidiaries independence tooperate without interference.    Once established, more problems are expected if extracompetition shaves margins.    Extra competition could cut management fees in the marksector. Separate management and underwriting fees common heremay also be eroded, which now make German underwriting businessprofitable compared with other centres.    A few banks are unsure if they really want to get involvedin the business. "I don't think Sumitomo has 100-pct concreteplans at this moment unless there is a new development," abanker at the West German commercial branch of Sumito Bank Ltdin Duesseldorf said.    Apart from the commercial branch in Duesseldorf Sumitomohas a rep office in Frankfurt, but both are primarily engagedin commercial banking.

BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-taxprofit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.    The unusual situation on the crude oil market last yearalso produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector andforced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.    The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses onstocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. Inthe parent company, the positive earnings developmentcontinued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover wasbalanced out by increased capacity use and price declines inraw materials.

reut2-010.sgm, BAHRAIN INTRODUCES NEW MONEY MARKET REGIME, Bahrain is introducing a new domesticmoney market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred onthe island's newly launched treasury bill programme.    The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to allcommercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 whichgives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements intreasury bills, or through discounting them.    The circular, released officially to Reuters, said currentarrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer bevalid except "in quite exceptional circumstances."    Under the current system, the agency provides the island's20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-termswaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-termloans secured against government development bonds.    "The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replacethese operations with short-term assistance based on Governmentof Bahrain treasury bills," the circular to banks states.    The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with asimultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at ahigher price which will reflect an interest charge.    The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements willnormally be for a period of seven days.    Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has sinceraised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme.    Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and havebeen making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offeredby the agency. But banking sources said the new regime fromApril 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasurybills in case they need funds from the central bank.    Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks holdtreasury bills, although the need by others to take up papercould increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allottedyields slightly.    Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme hadstarted at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct.    Banking sources said the cost of liquidity throughrepurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollarswaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity wouldforesake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlyingtreasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord. REUTER&#3;

This compares with the budgeted deficit of 3.5 billion dlrsfor the current 1986/87 year although the market expects theactual shortfall to be some 500 mln dlrs higher.    In its latest Economic Review, Westpac said powerfularguments could be advanced for eliminating the deficitaltogether next year or even budgeting for a modest surplus.    Westpac said such a policy would deliver the message thegovernment was determined to face deep-seated economicproblems. But it said it would be a great deal to expect of agovernment in what was probably an election year.    It said even a relatively minor cut in the deficit wouldrequire some unpleasant decisions, noting a repeat of the1986/87 budget's zero real growth in spending would only bringthe deficit to about 4.3 billion dlrs.    A cut of greater than two pct in real terms was needed if a2.5 billion dlr deficit was to be achieved and this requiredsome radical surgery to existing programs, the bank said.    Westpac said the government's mid-May mini-budget providedan opportunity for bold measures, both in relation to the sizeof the government's role in the economy and the principlesgoverning that activity, notably indexation of outlays.    It said official figures show 93 pct of outlays in some wayindexed, hard to justify when living standards outside thepublic sector were being eroded.    In current circumstances, the alternative to fiscaldiscipline is the sure road to bigger external debts, furthercurrency depreciation, a boost to inflation and, ultimately,capital flight, the bank said.

reut2-010.sgm, PHILIPPINE DEBT PACT SEEN AS GOOD FOR ECONOMY, The Philippines' restructuring of 13.2billion dlrs of foreign debt will provide a welcome boost forthe economy, but last Friday's accord with the country's12-bank advisory committee does not imply an overnight boom,bankers and businessmen polled by Reuters said.    "The successful negotiations form an important piece in themosaic," Christian Roeher, Secretary-General of the EuropeanChamber of Commerce, said. "Now is really the time for thegovernment to start implementing its ideas. There has been alot of talking and loud thinking."    Business leaders said the 17-year rescheduling ofcommercial bank debt would give President Corazon Aquino somebadly-needed breathing space, but warned her government wasstill in the midst of political consolidation.    "There is a lot of interest among foreign investors in thecountry, but now they are waiting to see what happens in thecongressional and local elections later this year," saidAmerican Chamber of Commerce president George Drysdale.    The government is serious about getting down to work, butthere are many individual agendas for growth and no consensus.But each step brings a unanimity of opinion closer, he said.    Aurelio Periquet, President of the Philippine Chamber ofCommerce and Industry, told Reuters the debt accord hadpositively translated the international banking community'sconfidence in the country's economy and Aquino's government.    "This government needs less pressure and more time andhappily our creditors seem to see it that way," he said. "Thisaccord may not result in an immediate boom, but at least itenhances the image of the country for foreign investors."    But Periquet said domestic and foreign investments fellshort of targets in 1986. "The accord does not solve all ourproblems," he added.    Periquet said the question of political stability no longerworried Filipino businessmen, who had already started expandingexisting businesses or investing in new areas.    "A number of us have already put in new money and there areplans for the export market," he said. "President Aquino hasshown her ability to pull the nation out of one crisis afteranother."    Roeher said foreign investment would probably be held backuntil after the congressional polls in May and the localelections in August. "The two elections will probably have amore decisive effect on the way business reacts," he said.    "Some foreign companies are not waiting, but they are morethe exception than the rule," Roeher said.    He said it was important the government ensure the creationof more jobs was not just a transitory development.    "The absorption of enormous aid given to the Philippines isalso poor. A lot of it has not been put to use. The governmentshould act without further delay to absorb the 1.7 billion dlrsof development aid it will receive in 1987," he said.    A foreign banker close to the debt negotiations said he didnot foresee any real boom until 1989.    "The problem is that Aquino has inherited her politicalsystem from (former President Ferdinand) Marcos," the bankersaid. "There is still a clamour for the sharing of benefits,different sectors claiming their rights and duties. If they gotoo fast there could be another bust two years down the road."    Businessman Raul Concepcion, whose brother Jose is thecountry's trade and industry minister, said everyone couldheave a sigh of relief. "Now that the debt agreement is out ofthe way, our economic and financial officials can concentrateon their work, like increasing government revenue andefficiency," he said. REUTER&#3;

Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years oldwould undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close aspossible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of thetree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded treesmature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos perhectare from the sixth year when they begin producing.    About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora.    Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, whichcauses leaves to fall off, De Mel said.    Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees.    De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as earlyas in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986that it became widespread.    The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how manytrees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will besprayed and remain under observation.    T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber ControllerDepartment, which monitors the industry, told Reutersreplanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken beforelate May when the monsoon rains begin.    De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptibleto corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned.    The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreignclones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058.    Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced byPB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102.    These six varieties would also be used to replace treesuprooted or base-budded, De Mel said.    Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees perhectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge.    "But no compensation is contemplated at the moment," headded.    De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control thespread of the disease.    "The drought has not stopped the disease, but probablyhelped in some way because trees have not been affected inareas that are dry," he said.    Brokers said the disease had not affected prices because ithas not caused a drop in production.    Prices for the best latex crepe at the Colombo auction lastweek firmed to 20.19 rupees per kilo from 20.05 rupees at theprevious sale. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, ONGPIN SAYS "PINS" WILL REVIVE BAKER PLAN, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin saidPhilippine Investment Notes (PINs), to be offered to commercialbank creditors as part of the country's 13.2 billion dlr debtrescheduling, would revive the Baker Plan.    PINs are tradable, foreign currency-denominated financialinstruments with a six-year maturity, designed for conversioninto pesos to fund government-approved equity investmentswithin the Philippines.    Ongpin told reporters after a meeting with businessmen thegovernment was planning to issue between 100 and 150 mln dlrsworth of PINs at a discount of about 12.5 pct this year.    The plan, outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker18 months ago, stalled because commercial banks balked at theidea of lending additional money, Ongpin said. It had calledfor substantial new commercial bank lending and developmentbank aid in order to help debtor countries grow out of theireconomic troubles.    The PINs provide a mechanism to finance the growth neededby these debtor nations, provided they are willing to welcomeforeign equity investment into their economies, Ongpin told abusinessmen's meeting. "And this can now be achieved withoutforcing commercial banks into involuntary new money lending."    Bankers in New York said given the booming market indebt-equity swaps, PINs ought to work if Manila issues thenotes at an appropriate discount.    Ongpin said the use of PINs would result in anticipatedsavings of one billion pesos over the debt agreement's 17-yearlife.    The accord restructured 5.8 billion dlrs of previouslyrescheduled debt, 3.5 billion dlrs of debt falling due betweenJanuary 1987 and December 1992, and 925 mln dlrs of new moneylent by the banks in 1985 at a spread of 7/8 percentage pointsover London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).    It also rolled over trade credits worth 2.9 billion dlrs.    Ongpin said the Philippines' 7-1/2 year grace period wasbetter than Mexico's seven-year grace period, while the PINsproposal would result in savings of foreign exchange andgenerate pesos which would be reinvested in domesticenterprises.    Ongpin said the restructuring of commercial bank debt, aswell as of 870 mln dlrs of debt by the Paris Club of Westerncreditor governments in January, was expected to reduce thecountry's debt-service ratio to between 25 and 30 pct from itscurrent level of 40 to 45 pct.    He said the country's balance of payments was now projectedat a surplus of about 1.2 billion dlrs in 1987, compared with asurplus of about 1.1 billion dlrs in 1986 and a previousprojected deficit of 1.2 billion dlrs this year.    The Philippine negotiating team refined the PINs idea threetimes before the final agreement was struck last Friday, Ongpinsaid. "What we have now is PINs IV," he said.    Ongpin told the meeting he had kept his promise to gainterms better than those granted last year to Mexico, which wona 20-year repayment at 13/16 points over LIBOR.    "And they (Mexico) are a long way from seeing any moneycross the table even as of today," Ongpin said, adding heexpected much quicker approval from all the Philippines' 483creditor banks worldwide.    He said he had been in almost daily telephone contact withPresident Corazon Aquino, particularly when the banks began totake a very tough stance on pricing.    "But the President's instructions were unequivocal andunwavering, 'Do not yield one more millimetre and I don't carehow long it takes. Get a green card if you have to, but don'tcome home without a deal we can all be proud of'," he said. REUTER&#3;

Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour byexchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of theexchange-trade currency option market against existingover-the-counter option trading during the local working day.    Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had becomean accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk andhad grown in popularity, he said.

Having the Philadelphia exchange open during theAsia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increasearbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuriesaccess to a currency option market of much greater depth andliquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

reut2-010.sgm, GERMAN CALL MONEY RISES ON PENSION PAYMENTS, Call money rose to 3.70/80 pct from3.50/60 pct in moderate business as liquidity drained from thesystem on pension payments by insurance firms, dealers said.    But the market was relatively liquid for the month's end,when rates usually tighten, dealers said. Call money was stillat or slightly below the 3.80 pct rate set on the most recentBundesbank securities repurchase offer last week.    The insurances would probably draw down some 11 billionmarks for pension payments. But part of this would be offset byan estimated five to six billion marks flowing in from treasurybills bought from the Bundesbank on Thursday, dealers said.     Rates could ease later in the week as bank customersdeposit part of their pension payments back with the bankstomorrow and Wednesday, and banks face reserve requirements fora new month, dealers said.    On Thursday, banks' actual daily reserve holdings fell to43.3 billion marks, down substantially from 49.1 billion onWednesday. But the daily average holdings for the first 25 daysof the month stood at 51.8 billion marks, well above therequired daily average net reserve holdings of 50.7 billion.    The Bundesbank has not scheduled a securities repurchasetender this week, since there is no expiring prior pact. dealers said liquidity was adequate without the addition of newrepo funding.    If tightness does occur the Bundesbank may add short-termtemporary federal government funds to counteract this.

reut2-010.sgm, COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE, BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE, The buffer stock rules agreement reachedon Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is animprovement on previous arrangements but the price-supportmechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoaprices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said.    The accord was reached between producers and consumers ofthe 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks.    European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said theaccord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surplusesoverhanging the market will pull prices down again before long.    "If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt itwill do anything more than stop the price from falling further,and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolateprices," a European dealer said.    And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying,or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the marketis relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction couldpressure prices dramatically, dealers said.    The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO,into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold tomanoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range.    A new cocoa agreement came into force in January butdelegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time.    The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stockmanager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next threeweeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producingcountries and assessing the market, since prices are below the"must-buy" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonnespecified in the agreement, the sources said.    The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach willbe more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said.    The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and abuying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes ofwhich are already in the buffer stock.    ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture MinisterDenis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance ofstabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoaproducer.    "We have established rules which will permit us to withdrawimmediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market," Bra Kanontold reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckonedthe world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee.    However, some producer and consumer members emerged fromthe final ICCO council meeting with reservations about thepact.    Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's mostexpensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings,made a formal protest to the council about the pricedifferentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too highfor Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.    According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of WestGermany, "Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the bufferstock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...Therewere no real winners or losers."    Some European Community delegates were not satisfied thatimportant points were fully discussed during the talks, and asa result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses aseffectively as they could have, delegates said.    Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seekoffers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials toreflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can compriseup to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.    London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg pertonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stgin January 1986.    A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council sessiondecides market conditions warrant it, according to theagreement.    The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fallbelow the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than fivedays and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity hasbeen filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.    The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at anexecutive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said. REUTER&#3;

The official declined to give details but securitiessources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-billsto be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buybills. The current practice of filing tax redemption claims istime consuming, they said.    Securities houses here have had difficulty sellingsix-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseasgovernments and central banks because of the tax system and theBank of Japan's book entry system, which demands the accountsbe kept with the houses rather than by the Bank.    Tankoku, introduced in February 1986, were designed as akey short-term instrument to promote internationalization ofthe yen. But since the introduction of a complicated book-entrysystem for bill purchases in January 1986, foreign governmentsand central banks have shied away from buying the bills, thesources said.

reut2-010.sgm, GERMAN BANKS OUTLOOK CLOUDIER AFTER RECORD 1986, When the largest German "universal"banks begin announcing 1986 results this week they shouldreport the third consecutive record year. But prospects for1987 and beyond would be distinctly cloudier, bank analystssaid.    Results should show the trend which began this decade wasunbroken. The proportion of earnings gleaned from commissionbusiness should be higher, while the role played by the moretraditional credit lending business would show further erosion.    Stock exchange volumes remained high last year, depite onlymodest share index rises in the year. In addition, major banks last year were very active in newbourse flotations and primary and secondary bond marketbusiness, banking analysts said.    Despite last week's quite strong rally, the depressed stockmarket and forecasts that it would probably not attractsustained interest from the global investment community made adownturn in commission business most likely.    Pressure on the interest rate margin and the increasingcompetition posed not only by foreign banks in Germany but byforeign stock exchanges, particularly London, would also bringmore guarded prognoses for the future from board members.    But one banking analyst said, "There's obviously no reasonto paint too dark a picture. In this decade so far, the bankshave posted practically only record profits, with increases of50 pct and more. This cycle must clearly end sometime."    One problem more psychological than real was West Germanbanks' exposure to Latin American debtor nations. Bankofficials have said that a good 70 pct of the exposure has beenwritten off on balance sheets.    Some analysts consider that the conservative accounting ofGerman banks may in some cases have prompted the writedown of80 or even 100 pct of several exposures there.    With almost all Latin American exposure denominated in dlrsand written down two or three years ago, the U.S. Currency'sfall has made further allocations to country risk reserves forthe region virtually unnecessary.    "German bank earnings have become much more dependent ondevelopments on the stock exchange than on the debt question," asecond analyst said.    It is precisely because of bank reporting rules that allowthe build up of "hidden" reserves known only to the Bundesbank,that few analysts produced precise earnings forecasts as theydid for corporate non-banks.    But Alastair France, of London brokers Alexanders, Laing &amp;Cruickshank, said his clculations showed that Deutsche Bank AG&lt;DBKG.F> would report a very strong 1986, boosted&amp;by&#127;herMdbs&#127;oa&#127; &#127;Z the FriedrichFlick &#127;nd&#127;st&#127;ieve&#127;waltung KGAAindustrial empire, followed by a fairly strong drop back thisyear and flat earnings in 1988.

On the same day, CPC announced it had agreed in principleto sell its European business to Ferruzzi in a 630 mln dlrdeal.    Noting that Ferruzzi was studying a public offering ofshares in its unit &lt;European Sugar (France)> to fund the CPCtakeover, Callebaut said Amylum may still succeed in its bid.

The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watchon exchange rate movements since last week, he said.

reut2-010.sgm, JAPAN ISOLATED, YEN RISES, WORLD FEELS CHEATED, Japan is becoming dangerously isolatedagain as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated byJapanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,officials and businessmen from around the world said.    As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investmentsgrit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidthere was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.    The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings byboth sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.    The document was prepared by a private committee formed byPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank ofJapan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop frictiondue to its large trade surpluses, Japan must "make a historicaltransformation in its traditional policies on economicmanagement and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no furtherdevelopment for Japan without this transformation."    Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and havelooked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But theJapanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium termprospects of totally transforming their economic habits.    The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japaneseprevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended toraise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports tothe U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateralsemiconductor pact.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened toblock Japanese financial firms from London after the Japaneseplaced what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bidby British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestictelecommunications joint venture.    On Friday, European currency dealers said European centralbanks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, mightleave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.    Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business groupKeidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictoryviews last November when he visited the European Community."Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that Ifound to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europewas the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in theresults of the Maekawa report," he said.    "We explained that the process of restructuring the economyaway from its dependence on exports toward a balance betweendomestic and external demand...Would take time," Saito said.    Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC IndustrialPolicy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said "Ionly know that your government, under the leadership ofMaekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a lessoutward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawareport which has attracted the most attention in Europe."    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. "A far betteranswer than protectionism would be structural change within theJapanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. Andwe hope to see changes occur in the near future," visitingChairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly thefault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea ofchange in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC businessleaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the tradeproblem.    "We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of theMaekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.    "The important implication of the Maekawa report is that itis finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of theirlabour," said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director ofShearson Lehman Brothers.    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report asfast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelledthe country asking about this issue.    He said People mentioned many things in line with thespirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal andsteel industries.    A major misunderstanding is that the private report wasgovernment policy. Europeans are confused about this,underlined by von Moltke's reference to the "leadership" of theMaekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to lastSeptember's government programme of new economic measures."Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point outthat the government has put its signature to a programmedesigned to implement the report," the ambassador said.

He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the thirdquarter this year.    The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serveclients in the region and educate financial markets about theadvantages of currency options, Giordano said.    Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour byexchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of theexchange-trade currency option market against existingover-the-counter option trading during the local working day.    Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had becomean accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk andhad grown in popularity, he said.    The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, includinga new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30billion U.S. Dlrs.    Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with theperformance of its Australian dollar contract, which since itsintroduction last year had regularly topped the French franc asthe third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000contracts traded daily.    Having the Philadelphia exchange open during theAsia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increasearbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuriesaccess to a currency option market of much greater depth andliquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

But the Plaza accorddid not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said.    The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief thatthe trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said.

reut2-010.sgm, DUTCH BONDS SEEN RALLYING FURTHER THIS WEEK, A further rally in Dutch bonds islikely this week, due to a lower dollar and a slightly firmerguilder against the mark attracting investors back to guildersfrom marks, bond analysts said.    The rally began last week, as proceeds from a sell-off indollar paper flooded into stronger currencies.    The state tender of a new 6.25 pct eight-year bulletindicates a week of active trading, dealers said.    "We've not had trade like this since last year's boom aroundthe May elections," said Wim Moret of Banque Paribas.    Moret was referring to the strong demand for Dutch bonds upto and following last year's election of Prime Minister RuudLubbers, whose centre-right coalition government was pledged toa tight economic programme which bolstered the guilder.    Last week, a wide sell-off of dollar and sterling boosteddemand for mark and guilder paper. Japanese corporate investorswere active buyers as the end of their accounting year, March31, approached.    Dutch prices and trade volume reached their highest levelthis year. Total turnover topped four billion guilders, after3.5 billion in the previous active trading week.    While volume was considerable, prices rose more moderately.The bourse bond index rose to 117.3 last Friday, a rise of 1.9against its level two week's earlier.    Foreign investors took the lion's share of trade last week,but dealers noted considerable switching by domestic investorsas the yield differential between mark and guilder issuesenticed arbitrage activity.    The dollar, mark and sterling started this week even lower,heightening the chances of lively foreign demand forguilder-denominated paper, dealers said.    Today's declines could also be partly attributed toinvestors selling in a bid to force down prices ahead of thestate loan tender tomorrow.    "This is quite a normal situation. It's natural forinvestors to want the highest yield for the lowest price. Itensures firm demand at tomorrow's tender," one dealer said.     The terms of the new issue are seen drawing firm domesticand foreign demand, especially since the yield premium on Dutchlong maturities has grown to 0.45 pct over similar mark issues.    The loan will be the fourth state issue for payment thisyear, and also the fourth with a 6.25 pct coupon, since Dutchinterest rates have changed little this year.    Bond analysts said that in view of the state's practice ofweighting the bulk of its capital market borrowing in the firsthalf of the year, it would be likely to raise at least fourbillion guilders.    Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson, said thestate has raised about 15.3 billion of its 1987 capital marketrequirement of an estimated 32 billion guilders. Of this total,7.3 billion was raised on the public capital market.    Basing their judgement on today's market conditions,dealers expected the loan to be priced at 101.00 pct for ayield of 6.09 pct.    "But everything hinges on tomorrow. If prices decline andyields rise, it may be priced at a fraction below that," onedealer said.    On the domestic front, dealers say investors are amplycovered by a 4.2 billion guilder nine-day special advance bythe Dutch central bank, which has given the money marketsufficient liquidity until Friday, when the provision expires.

reut2-010.sgm, TOKYO BIDS TO STOP CHIP ROW BECOMING TRADE WAR, Japan is seeking to prevent its computerchips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scaletrade war, government officials said.    "We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't havean adverse effect on our overall relationship with the UnitedStates," a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)official said.     On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo'salleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.    That agreement, reached last year after heatednegotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chipsin world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.    Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate thefall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at theend of April.    While Japan has already done about all it can to make surethe chip pact is working, the government is studying measuresit can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensurethe trip's success, they said.    "The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,"one official told Reuters. "We would very much like to dosomething to respond to that."    In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute fromspreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict theU.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductormakers, not to the government.    Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and anangry American Congress, the Japanese government has beenforced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductordispute, trade analysts said.    They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largestchip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as thedraconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,included enforced production cuts.    The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to theannouncement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficultiesthe government faces in taking further action.    "Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with theU.S./Japan agreement," said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of theElectronic Industries Association of Japan.    He accused the U.S. of being "irrational." He said the U.S.action had made the bilateral chip pact "meaningless."    Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the disputethrough consultations.    Japan is expected to send a high-level official toWashington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not togo ahead with the tariffs on April 17.    Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industryplans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a jointinvestigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping. Reuter&#3;
reut2-010.sgm, U.S. APPEARS TO TOLERATE FURTHER DLR DECLINE, In a bid to hasten Japan's promiseto speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreigntrade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaledtheir tolerance of a lower dollar.    Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides,Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was notarget for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaringagainst the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention.    "That was no slip of the tongue," said one western monetaryofficial, who asked not to be identified.    For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japaneseofficials said late last week a package to bolster domesticdemand will be ready in early April. Until last week, therewere few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.    The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congressover the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billiondlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results fromJapan, dramatic action is required.    Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs oncertain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhereto a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.    The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appeasemounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes justtwo weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to reviewthe Paris agreement to stabilize currencies.    And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr tradesurplus in the first two months this year just underscored theneed for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials.    Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in thedeficit. "I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive somebenefits (from the lower dollar) soon," said one.    In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperateclosely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting"underlying economic fundamentals" or economic reality.    The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japanand West Germany stimulating their economies and the UnitedStates cutting its budget deficit.    The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada,agree these policies are essential to redress huge global tradeimbalances.    But analysts say markets have signalled the underlyingfundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.    Markets, in effect, are less confident than governmentsthat these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cutsagreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out.    Nonetheless, the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was ontrack and Tokyo and Bonn seem "to want more stimulative measureswhich is what the Paris accord calls for."    International monetary sources said exchange marketdevelopments generally have not unsettled policymakers,although Japan is an obvious exception. "Everybody feels it canstill be managed," one source said of market developments.    But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated fivebillion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and othercentral banks about one billion dlrs.    Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America'shalf-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting theParis accord outright.    The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economicpolicymaking, said Japan's understanding of the accord was thatthe yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level itstood at when the accord was struck.    The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington'suse of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a"pointed reminder" to Japan to do something about the tradeissues, the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen.    By departing last Sunday from the language of the Parisaccord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stabilityaround current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar.    Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target forthe dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up totheir international responsibilities and stimulate growth.    But U.S. officials said recent market developments will notunravel the spirit of the Paris agreement.    "There's a realisation now that you cannot leave thingsalone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalancesought to be adjusted," one official said.    "While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, wecertainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,"another U.S. official said.    The officials said the meeting here, where the six will bejoined by Italy, will be a status report.    "Japan will have to explain what the state of their programis and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there's a needto move faster," one source said.    Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, ineffect, for currency stability for several months. This wouldbuy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economicgrowth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit.    His comments appeared to serve notice on other majornations that Washington cannot wait too long for action toreduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surplusesand the U.S. trade deficit.

The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon asJapan started adhering to the agreement. But they said therewas little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert thehigher tariffs.

A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened totackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea keptto Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potentialclash.    Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefingopposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday.    The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request toWashington to close down its telecommunications base at NeaMakri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which hadprompted it to make the request were no longer valid.    Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece hasthe right to ask for suspension of operations at times when itsnational interests are threatened.    The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it wouldsearch for oil round three Greek islands off its coastfollowing an announcement from Greece that it planned to drilleast of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-ledoil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.    Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreementunder which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in theAegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled.Athens says it considers the accord inactive.    The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it hadreceived an assurance from Greece that it would not carry outoil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declinedcomment on the statement.    Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take thelong-standing continental shelf dispute to the InternationalCourt of Justice at The Hague.

reut2-010.sgm, ONGPIN SAYS "PINS" WILL REVIVE BAKER PLAN, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin saidPhilippine Investment Notes (PINs), to be offered to commercialbank creditors as part of the country's 13.2 billion dlr debtrescheduling, would revive the Baker Plan.    PINs are tradable, foreign currency-denominated financialinstruments with a six-year maturity, designed for conversioninto pesos to fund government-approved equity investmentswithin the Philippines.    Ongpin told reporters after a meeting with businessmen thegovernment was planning to issue between 100 and 150 mln dlrsworth of PINs at a discount of about 12.5 pct this year.    The plan, outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker18 months ago, stalled because commercial banks balked at theidea of lending additional money, Ongpin said. It had calledfor substantial new commercial bank lending and developmentbank aid in order to help debtor countries grow out of theireconomic troubles.    The PINs provide a mechanism to finance the growth neededby these debtor nations, provided they are willing to welcomeforeign equity investment into their economies, Ongpin told abusinessmen's meeting. "And this can now be achieved withoutforcing commercial banks into involuntary new money lending."    Bankers in New York said given the booming market indebt-equity swaps, PINs ought to work if Manila issues thenotes at an appropriate discount.    Ongpin said the use of PINs would result in anticipatedsavings of one billion pesos over the debt agreement's 17-yearlife.    The accord restructured 5.8 billion dlrs of previouslyrescheduled debt, 3.5 billion dlrs of debt falling due betweenJanuary 1987 and December 1992, and 925 mln dlrs of new moneylent by the banks in 1985 at a spread of 7/8 percentage pointsover London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).    It also rolled over trade credits worth 2.9 billion dlrs.    Ongpin said the Philippines' 7-1/2 year grace period wasbetter than Mexico's seven-year grace period, while the PINsproposal would result in savings of foreign exchange andgenerate pesos which would be reinvested in domesticenterprises.    Ongpin said the restructuring of commercial bank debt, aswell as of 870 mln dlrs of debt by the Paris Club of Westerncreditor governments in January, was expected to reduce thecountry's debt-service ratio to between 25 and 30 pct from itscurrent level of 40 to 45 pct.    He said the country's balance of payments was now projectedat a surplus of about 1.2 billion dlrs in 1987, compared with asurplus of about 1.1 billion dlrs in 1986 and a previousprojected deficit of 1.2 billion dlrs this year.    The Philippine negotiating team refined the PINs idea threetimes before the final agreement was struck last Friday, Ongpinsaid. "What we have now is PINs IV," he said.    Ongpin told the meeting he had kept his promise to gainterms better than those granted last year to Mexico, which wona 20-year repayment at 13/16 points over LIBOR.    "And they (Mexico) are a long way from seeing any moneycross the table even as of today," Ongpin said, adding heexpected much quicker approval from all the Philippines' 483creditor banks worldwide.    He said he had been in almost daily telephone contact withPresident Corazon Aquino, particularly when the banks began totake a very tough stance on pricing.    "But the President's instructions were unequivocal andunwavering, 'Do not yield one more millimetre and I don't carehow long it takes. Get a green card if you have to, but don'tcome home without a deal we can all be proud of'," he said. REUTER&#3;

Experts say the proposals put forward last month by theEuropean Commission could lead to a double-digit percentagefall in guaranteed prices for the 1987/88 crop year.    Consideration of the price measures comes as farm surplusesand subsidies are set to dominate forthcoming talks under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.    The talks signal the official start of months of annualwrangling over subsidy levels paid to the EC's 12 mln farmers.    Agriculture worldwide is plagued by surplus production anddepressed prices, with domestic economic policies largelyblamed for the crisis.

"The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) andmarket forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit," one seniorFinance Ministry official said.    He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to specialfactors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead ofthe March 31 end to their fiscal year.    That selling largely came to an end this morning afterabout one hour of trading here, the senior official said. "They(the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock(0100 GMT)," he said.    After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning,the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20.Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilisethe dollar above 150 yen.    Several officials said they did not see any fundamentalreason for the dollar's recent sharp fall.    One official even called the market's recent actionsirrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs onJapanese electronics goods should support the dollar againstthe yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., Hesaid.

After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yenfrom an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finishof 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering,they said.    "I think (Nakasone's) desperate," said a U.S. Bank foreignexchange manager.    Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliamentthat Japan and other industrialized nations committedthemselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above150 yen.    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committeethat the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. AndWest Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollarfell below 150 yen.

The key U.S. 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a lowof 96.08-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 98.05-06 New Yorkfinish, then recovered to 96.20-22.    Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investmenttrusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on theforeign exchange market here today, accentuating the unit'stumble, securities house dealers said.    They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cashpositions resulting from their dollar sales today, and aresidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interestrates outlook clarifies, a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currencytrader said.    The dollar's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds willfurther promote diversification into other foreign investments,as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stockmarkets from overseas bond markets, securities bond managerssaid.    They said major Japanese investors in the past two yearsare estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreignportfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S.Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct.    Since late last year, Japanese investors, seekingsubstantial liquidity and attractive yields, have used freshfunds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and, after theParis currency pact, actively bought French franc bonds andgilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories, themanagers said.    Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowedinto local bond and stock markets as well.    The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a recordlow of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish andcompared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit.    The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points formore than a month here, suggesting most dealers could notsatisfy their needs for capital gains, dealers said.    A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts inU.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo's stock market.The stock market's bullishness late last week was partly due tofunds transferred from U.S. Treasuries, dealers said.    Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the firsthalf of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared withaverage monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of1986, Finance Ministry sources said.    The steep fall is due to Japanese investors' cool attitudetowards U.S. Bonds, which had amounted to more than 80 pct oftotal foreign securities purchased, securities houses managerssaid.    Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed therecord high of 1.5 billion dlrs seen in December, they said.

reut2-010.sgm, CANADA GDP UP 0.1 PCT IN JANUARY, Canada's gross domestic product rose 0.1pct, seasonally adjusted, in January after gaining 1.0 pct inDecember but falling 0.1 pct and 0.3 pct in November andOctober, Statistics Canada said.    January's rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5pct gain in the goods producing sector. Output inservices-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December'slevel.    January's level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month ayear ago.    The federal agency said it was the second straight gain forgoods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred inmanufacturing and construction.    Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood,machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups.Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobilesand parts, however.    In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance andcommunication were more than offset by declines intransportation, storage and the retail trade. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, TECHNOLOGY/IBM'S NEW COMPUTER NERVOUSLY AWAITED, International Business Machines Corp&lt;IBM> is widely expected to deeply affect the personal computerindustry this week when it announces a long awaited newgeneration of desktop machines.     The four new computers, expected to be called the PersonalSystem 2 family, are almost sure to veer away from industrywidestandards for personal computers that were first established byIBM six years ago.     The result id the new computers will be harder to copy andless likely to work with software and attachments designed forexisting standards. Some market researchers are alreadypredicting slower growth as customers adjust to the change.    A proprietary IBM pc will cause the pc market's growth tobe flat or even negative in 1988 as vendors and users delaypurchases to gauge the importance of the new machine,'' saidJohn McCarthy, consultant with Forrester Research Inc.     IBM is traditionally very close-mouthed about unannouncedproducts, but so intense is the interest in these machines thatsome details have leaked out and consultants, dealers and thetrade press are rife with information, both factual orsupposed.    The four computers expected to be announced April 2 willreportedly include one low end, low cost computer, two modelsthat will resemble IBM's current high-end AT, and, mostimportantly, a computer incorporating Intel Corp's &lt;INTC> 80386microprocessor, the powerhouse chip that is revolutionizing thepersonal computer.    The microprocessor is the brains of a computer and Intelmicroprocessors are the ones used in all IBM and IBM-compatiblepersonal computers, by far the largest segment of the desktopmarket.     The 80386, more commonly called the 386, processescomputer instructions twice as fast as the chips used inexisting IBM computers and 386-based desktop computers are aspowerful as the much larger minicomputers of a few years ago.     Although IBM will not be the first company to introduce a386 personal computer - Compaq Corp &lt;CPQ> was - most industryconsultants believe that customers will not rush to embrace thenew generation until they see what the world's largest computercompany is going to do.    What IBM will apparently do is introduce a computer thatis, at least temporarily, copy-proof. That is a far differentsituation than exists with IBM's current family of personalcomputers, which are cloned widely.     With the Personal System, IBM will reportedly build asmany features as possible directly into the computers'motherboards, including graphics capabilities, a non-standardbus for add-on equipment and a new version of the operatingsystem used on all IBM compatible computers.     The word in (Silicon) Valley is that it will take two mlndlrs and 18 months before the machines can be copied,'' saidMichael Murphy, publisher of the newsletter CaliforniaTechnology Stock Letter.      At the same time as Personal System is unveiled,Microsoft Corp &lt;MSFT> is expected to unveil a new version ofits MS/DOS operating system, DOS 3.3, that will correct many ofthe programming problems encountered on earlier versions of thesoftware. MS/DOS is used with all IBM personal computers.      Consultants said that most existing IBM-compatiblesoftware will run on the new computers but software writtenspecifically for the Personal System will not run on oldermodels.     The industry will be looking closely at the delivery datesfor the new computers, particularly the 386, because if IBMdoes not start shipping its entry in this important new marketsoon, Compaq will continue to gain larger and larger marketshare.    Market researcher Future Computing Inc estimated thatCompaq's Deskpro 386, which started shipping last October, isgenerating sales of between 3.5 mln and and four mln dlrs amonth. In the first six months of availability between 21 and24 mln dlrs worth of Deskpro 386s were sold.    Said Future Computing analyst Joe Cross, "That's someindication of the kind of money IBM is leaving on the table." Reuter&#3;
reut2-010.sgm, SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID, Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countriesfor emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by thecountry's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.    Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aidneeded for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.    The letter said the government had to step in "to avertserious economic hardship" and because the Social ServicesMinistry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provisionof 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.    The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a sixmonth period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice cropwas harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour andother cereals were required, it said, along with supplies ofsugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.    In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha(October 1986-April 1987) crop had been "almost completelydevastated," the letter said. Maha paddy output was nowestimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originallyexpected.    There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a highforecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequaterainfall within the next three to four weeks.    "Should the present drought continue, however, production isestimated at around 20 mln bushels," the letter added.    Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Lastyear's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.    The letter said villagers in most seriously affecteddistricts had been deprived of any means of subsistence becausesubsidiary crops had also failed.    It said the government's current budget did not permit itto provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected."Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodityprices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continueto exert pressure on the expenditure side."    The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees permonth for each family, as well as handling, transport anddistribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds bythe government would not be possible without seriouslyimpairing development projects, or "greatly fuelling inflation"in the economy, the letter said.    The letter said the Food Department would be able torelease wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet theimmediate cereal requirements "provided such stocks are replacedsubsequently."    The Meteorological Department said the country wasexperiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-monthdry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break whenthe monsoon rains fell in late May.    The letter said some areas had been experiencing thedrought since August, and in the rice growing district ofKurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June1986. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, TRADE BODY SETS NEW RULES FOR EURODOLLAR MANAGERS, The International Primary Market MakersAssociation, a trade organisation, said its board last weekadopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bondissues make a market in that security for 12 months.    Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the partof firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is noformal obligation to do so.    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, inexplaining why the recommendation was adopted, said "It is aimedat the problem of the lead manager who does a deal anddisappears."    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members toadhere to the rule. "We're under no illusions about the legalbinding force of these recommendations," he said.    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts tosupport an unprofitable issue just a short while after it hasbeen offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no oneto buy it back from them.    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating ratesnotes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned thesecurities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17billion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the boardonly applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not havehelped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that thecriteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some ofthe smaller firms.    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running leadmanager during the two preceding years of 12 internationallydistributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one ofeight other major currencies.    The former requirement called for three lead-managedissues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrancerequirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by sixto 10 members.    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrictmembership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitiveand that it reinforces the big firms' already large marketshare.    "Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige withborrowers," said a dealer at a small foreign bank. "The borrowersays to himself, "Well I can travel economy or I can travelfirst class,'" he said.    Sibson defended the new rules saying "We have to steer acourse between representing the interests of the major marketmakers and the less desirable goal of representing everybody."    In any event, he said, the size of the market has expandedto the point where the former minimum size requirements werejust too small.    Also, IPMA members will be required to register with theAssociation of International Bond Dealers as reporting dealers,submitting daily information on prices on issues in which theyare market makers. The effective date of the rule has yet to bedetermined.    Dealers said that the rule would enable investors andsecondary market makers to better evaluate the appropriatemarket price for their securities. Such a rule would makeinvestors more confident of trading in the eurobond market andwould increase liquidity, they said.    Dealers said that the form of the reporting has not yetbeen spelled out. But previous discussion of the reportingrequirement considered firms listing the closing price of agiven security as well as the high and low for the day.     Members also agreed at the IPMA meeting on theimplementation of a new communications system which enables alead manager to invite all potential management group membersin to a deal at the same time.

Selling was described as relatively modest, although veryfew buyers appeared to take up the slack.

Dealers noted that market confidence had already been at alow ebb, with much of the recent impressive rise whittled awaylast week as investors reacted nervously to opinion pollsshowing unexpectedly strong gains for the centristLiberal/Social Democratic alliance.    The market had been sustained in large part during itsrecent rally by a virtual conviction that the rulingConservative party would first call and then win a generalelection early this summer.    However, advances credited to the alliance last week havecast doubt on both assumptions.

reut2-010.sgm, ICO BOARD SEEN UNLIKELY TO SET NEW COFFEE TALKS, Chances that the International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agreeto resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICOdelegates and trade sources said.    ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries areready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side thatreopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said.    ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight dayswhen producers and consumers failed to reach agreement.     "Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions,it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage,"Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must benegotiated sometime, he said.     The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotasbut that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lowerits export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegatessaid.     At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICOboard is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, thereintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and someadministrative matters, according to a draft agenda.    The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president JorioDauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum andchief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending themeeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be anon-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned.    "I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking amongproducers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposalby September (the next scheduled council meeting)," BronwynCurtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said.    Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that adate will be set for an earlier council meeting.    If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect thecoffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for theremainder of its life, to September 30, 1989.    When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largestcoffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one anotherfor sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise.    Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares,under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports,but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for sharesto be redistributed using "objective criteria," which would havethreatened Brazil's share.    At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers,Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put theirobjections as members of the group of eight ICO "dissident"producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline inprices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro MartinezCuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to briefproducers on the Managua meeting.    However, other producers said they were not aware of thismove toward producer solidarity.

reut2-010.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. CONGRESS RAPS JAPAN, The U.S. Congress is making Japan,with its enormous worldwide trade surplus, the symbol of theU.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn aroundAmerica's record trade deficit.    "Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: thechallenge to our high technology industries, the threat ofgovernment nutured competition, and the multitude of barriersto our exports," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said.    "If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over tradeproblems, we can manage our difficulties with other countries,"the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committeehearing on the trade bill.    Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, havemade trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-rangingbill is being readied for probable House approval next month.    Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrsin 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year. Its surplus rose to 8.14billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.    Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. tradedeficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance tothe dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason topress Japan to buy more U.S. goods.    They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deteriorationin U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.    In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced heintended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japaneseelectronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide bya 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.    Congress also has been been angered by the administration'slack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issuesincluding beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunicationsgoods, and financial services.    The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week infour committees. It is a package of trade sanctions andmeasures to force the administration take tough action againstforeign trade barriers and unfair competition.    Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in manycases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japaneseproducts or make them more expensive with higher duties.    The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the HouseWays and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is toforce President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreigncompetition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to wintemporary relief from surges in imports.    The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrictimports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do notbuy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirantfrom Missouri, has the support of Wright and other keyDemocrats to press for passage of the amendment.    The measure would have the most impact on Japan, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, doesnot reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States wouldset import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten percent a year for three years.    "I'm tired of going into companies and having managers sayto me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can'tcompete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be takenaway from American business," Gephardt said.    The administration has said it could not support a tradebill containing such a provision.    &#3;

reut2-010.sgm, SENATE BILL WOULD ALLOW FARM LOAN WRITE-DOWNS, The U.S. Senate has approved ameasure that would allow an estimated 4,200 agricultural banksto write off loan losses over 10 years.    The measure, offered by Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), wasattached to a bill to recapitalize the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp that the Senate approved March 27.    Dixon's amendment would permit agricultural banks -- bankswith assets of 100 mln dlrs or less and at least 25 pct oftotal loans in farm loans -- to write down over 10 yearsagricultural loan losses incurred between 1984 and 1992.    Dixon said current law, which requires losses to bededucted immediately from bank capital, "forces banks to try notto acknowledge the extent of their problems."    Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) said farm banks have beenconcerned that write-downs might reduce their capitalizationbelow the six pct regulatory requirement.    Last year Congress urged federal regulators to useforbearance in the assessment of agricultural loans. However,Kassebaum said "only a miniscule number of banks" have qualifiedfor the capital forbearance provisions.    Dixon's measure also would allow agricultural banks toamortize losses on the reduced value of farmland acquired inthe handling of agricultural loans. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, GM &lt;GM> SAID TO CUT 2ND QTR OUTPUT SCHEDULES, General Motors Corp has cut 100,000cars from its second quarter production schedule, according toAutomotive News.    The trade paper, citing "sources both within GM and on theoutside," said GM plans to build 1,042,708 cars in the quarter,a nine pct reduction from its earlier estimate. The cut couldlead to further layoffs at GM, it said.    A GM spokesman said the company does not disclose future production schedules.    Auto analysts said the cut would make sense for GM, whichhas high car inventories.    A 100,000-car reduction in output would only take GM partof the way toward reducing high inventories, said Ron Glantz,analyst with Montgomery Securities.    "They should be cutting a lot more than they are," ShearsonLehman analyst Michael Lucky said. He estimated that, even ifGM cut an additional 100,000 cars from its second quarterproduction, it would still have a 75-day supply of cars.    Normal inventory level is 50 to 65 days supply. At the endof March, the automaker had 95 days supply, Lucky said.    Glantz said that at the end of February GM had 361,000excess vehicles, including both cars and trucks.    The production cuts could lead to increased layoffs,although those would likely be temporary rather than indefinitelayoffs, said Lucky.    He said the automaker might also use this as an opportunityto close some plants. Lucky estimates that GM needs to shut twoor three more assembly plants to bring its capacity more inline with demand.

It said Nigeria also plans to hold talks with a newlyappointed representative for those creditors fairly soon, andthat Nigeria also will call "at an early date" an extraordinarymeeting of noteholders, including holders of the new notes. Thepurpose of that meeting will be to consider a resolution to thearrears on the trade debt and the promissory notes.    Nigeria missed the first principal payment due on the noteslast autumn and another payment of about 30 mln dlrs that wasdue in early January because of a cash shortage, which stemmedpartly from the drop in oil prices last year.    An official of the Law Debenture Trust said he did not knowwhen the new representative for the noteholders, David Murison,would meet the Nigerians. He noted the Nigerians currently areattempting to negotiate bilateral agreements with members ofthe Paris Club of western creditor governments under amultilateral pact on these debts reached in December. So far,bilateral accords have been reached with the U.K. And France.    Law Debenture Trust, as trustee for the notes, has beenattempting to organise a meeting between the note holders andNigeria for the last coupole of months. The appointment ofMurison, chairman of Westpac Banking Corp's Mase Westpac Ltdunit in London, was made in an effort to better coordinatethese efforts.    The Law Debenture official said Murison will begin talkswith Nigeria as soon as they return to London. And although itis hoped that a meeting of all note holders could be held byend-May, he said this may not be possible since four weeksnotice of the meeting is required by law.    The discussions with the note holders are being held inconjunction with proposals to rescheduling Nigeria's debt tocommercial banks and official credit agencies.    When talks began last April on rescheduling part of thecountry's approximate 19 billion dlrs of foreign debt, thecommercial banks insisted that it be contingent on Nigeriaobtaining a rescheduling of its official debts as well. TheNigerians then extended this to include all uninsured tradedebt.    The commercial bank package has yet to be signed due inpart to the reluctance of Japanese banks, which have arelatively small exposure, to participate. REUTER&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - NEW ZEALAND DLR FRNS, Floating-rate notes denominated in aforeign currency, a relatively new wrinkle on Wall Street, willprobably be issued infrequently because the so-called "windowof opportunity" opens and closes quickly, traders say.    "In just two days we had as many issues. As a result, themarket became glutted," said one trader.    He said the window depends more on supply than on foreignexchange or interest rate risk, at least for the moment."Obviously, currency risk is important. But there is a limitednumber of investors right now for the paper," he said.    On Thursday, Bear, Stearns and Co sole-managed a 100 mlnNew Zealand dlr offering of three-year floating-rate notesissued by Ford Motor Credit Co, a unit of Ford Motor Co &lt;F>.    The initial rate for the notes will be set on April 15, andquarterly after that, at 200 basis points below the 90-day NewZealand bank bill rate. They are non-callable for life.    This followed by a week another Bear Stearns-led offeringof the same amount of New Zealand dollar notes for Dow ChemicalCo &lt;DOW>. The initial rate was also to be initially set onApril 15, and quarterly after that, at 340 basis points belowthe same 90-day New Zealand rate.    Because the Dow Chemical notes carried an interest ratefloor of 17 pct, the issue saw strong investor demand,underwriters said.    But the Ford Credit notes and Friday's offering of 130 mlnNew Zealand dlrs of floating-rate notes due 1990 issued byGeneral Electric Co's &lt;GE> General Electric Credit Corp viaPrudential-Bache Securities Inc, did not have such a floor.    "Obviously, the two firms did not want to issue floatersand face the risk of New Zealand rates falling sharply," anunderwriter away from the syndicates said. He and others notedthat the New Zealand 90-day rate was 27 pct late last week.    An underwriter familiar with the Dow Chemical deal pointedout that because of the interest rate and currency swaps Dowdid, the issuer felt comfortable setting a rate floor.    Domestic offerings of foreign currency denominated datefirst surfaced in Fall 1985. By using currency and rate swaps,companies can sell debt that pays a high interest rate in aforeign currency like Australian or New Zealand dollars. Butthe issuers actually realize savings on borrowing costs.    "I would say that every company which issued foreigncurrency debt saved some basis points when compared tosame-maturity plain vanilla U.S. issues," an analyst said.    Investors, mainly institutions, were attracted to the earlyissues because of the high interest rates. They were willing toabsorb foreign currency risk until mid-1986, when sharp slidesposted by the Australian and New Zealand dollars brought suchissuance to a quick halt.    It was not until late last year, after the currenciesstabilized, that companies again started issuing debtdenominated in Australian and New Zealand dollars.    But many investors have still shied away from the debt,remembering the mid-1986 downturn of the Australian and NewZealand dollars, analysts noted.    To attract some of those investors back to the fold,underwriters like Bear Stearns decided to structure the foreigncurrency issues as floating rate debt, sources said.    This occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty over thecourse of U.S. interest rates for the intermediate term, andpredictions by a number of economists that Treasury yieldswould rise in the second half of the year, the sources noted.    A Bear Stearns officer said more than half of the FordCredit notes were sold by late Friday afternoon, the second dayof offering. "That is quicker than some recent fixed-rate NewZealand dollar note issues," he said.    However, underwriters away from the Bear Stearns syndicatesaid the issue may have sold even faster if Prudential-Bachedid not offer the General Electric Credit notes on Friday.    They pointed out that the Ford notes were rated A-1 byMoody's Investors and AA-minus by Standard and Poor's, whilethe General Electric notes, which had the same interest rateterms and were also non-callable to maturity, carriedtop-flight AAA ratings by both agencies.    "We have sold 20 to 25 pct of the GE notes. For first-daysales on a Friday afternoon, I'm happy with the results," anofficer on Prudential-Bache's syndicate desk said.    Investors pay the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreigncurrency-denominated notes, underwriters said.    Investment bankers said the next floating-rate issue of NewZealand or Australian dollar-denominated debt is probably a fewweeks away.    "I would like to underwrite a deal a day. But with the Dow,Ford and GE offerings, the marketplace has had enough for thetime being," the Prudential-Bache officer admitted.    Meanwhile, IDD Information Services said the 30-daycorporate visible supply fell to 3.29 billion dlrs last weekfrom 3.98 billion dlrs in the previous week. Reuter&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, IBC EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN COFFEE EXPORT FORMULA, The Brazilian Coffee Institute,IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system whenit reopens export registrations, probably later this week,exporters said.    They said IBC President Jorio Dauster is likely to leavethe basic formula for the minimum registration price unchangedbut raise the contribution quota to partially offset theeffects of cruzado devaluation since April registrations wereclosed in mid-February.    To fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have tobe around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.    However, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contributionquota would make Brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets,and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, theexporters said.    They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contributionquota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnetfunds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteedproducer price.    Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide morefunds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds lastweek, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.    The sources said it is still unclear when registrationswill be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end ofthis week.    "Brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentionsknow. A country like Brazil cannot afford to be permanentlyclosed down," one exporter said.    However, before announcing its export policy the IBC islikely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of theInternational Coffee Organisation, ICO, executive board inLondon decides to call a full council meeting to discussreintroduction of export quotas, sources said.    There is also talk of the announcement this week of newmeasures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could beawaiting clarification before making any move, the exporterssaid.    Another factor which could be delaying the opening ofregistrations is the current strike by bank workers which,while not affecting current shipments, could affectdocumentation and currency operations for new sales.    This would certainly be the case if the IBC was consideringobliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two orthree days of registering a sale.&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, CHIRAC URGES EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY PLAN, French Prime Minister Jacques Chiraccalled on leading Western nations to set up a mechanism whichwould put a stop to volatile foreign exchange rates.    In a speech prepared for delivery to businessmen andbankers in New York, Chirac said said monetary stablility was akey element in bringing the world financial system back tohealth.    "The industrialized states should agree to set up a monetaryframework which would provide the necessary stability as wellas sufficient flexibility to allow ajustments when needed,"Chirac said.    "This requires a monitoring and alert mechanism which wouldpermit a timely and concerted reaction," he said.    The prime minister, on the first day of a three-day visitto the United States, said the February 22 Paris accords agreedby the "Group of Five" industrial nations should serve as a basisfor the new mechanism.     Under the Paris accords, the United States, Britain,France, West Germany, and Japan agreed to stabilize exchangerates around existing parities. But, only five weeks after theywere signed, they have failed to stop the dollar tumbling torecord lows against the yen.    Chirac said the means to monitor exchange rate movementswere readily available. "What is needed is the political will touse these more completely, in the spirit of the Parisaccords... "    In other points of his speech, Chirac called on countrieswith high trade surpluses -- an apparent reference to Japan --to open up their markets and stimulate demand.    He warned the United States that protectionist measures asdebated in the U.S. Congress would bring a tough  response fromthe 12-nation European Community.    "Europe is very sensitive to every rumour of protectionism.It will react with energy and solidarity because it does notwant to ruin its chances of recovery."    The Reagan administration is seeking to tone down a toughtrade bill which if passed would require the president toretaliate against countries deemed to discriminate against U.S.Goods.    Chirac also appealed for an effort from developed countriesto help the Third World by reducing interest rates andstimulating commodity prices.    "No stock-pile mechanism can run counter to the underlyingtrend of the market. These agreements must be complemented byfinancial aid to the developing countries hardest hit by thedecline."    Chirac said he hoped concrete steps could be reached onthese issues at forthcoming international meetings -- theInternational Monetary Fund/World Bank session in Washingtonand the June summit of seven leading western nations in Venice.

The company said its motion cites over 200 errors containedin the February 12 appeals court decision, adding its "briefsimply 'rubberstamps' the original trial court judgment whichthe company has said 'riddled with errors'."    In support of its argument, Texaco's motion emphasized arecent case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the SeventhCircuit in Chicago in Skycom Corp v. Telstar Corp as"unequivocal confirmation that the Texas Court's opinion iswrong," according to Gibson Gayle, a Texaco attorney with theHouston firm of Fulbright and Jaworski.    "The United States Court of Appeals in Chicago issued theruling based on facts strikingly similar to the facts in theTexaco-Pennzoil litigation," he said.    "The question before the (federal appeals) court waswhether an "agreement in principle' subject to execution of'formal documents' is a contract according to New York law.    "The answer by the court was a resounding 'No' -- preciselyopposite the answer given by the Appellate Court in Texas,"Gayle said.    "The United States Court of appeals reached this decisionfor the identical reasons that Texas and the Attorney Generalof New York have cited in their briefs before the Texasappellate court," he pointed out.    "Texaco has consistently maintained that Pennzoil did nothave a binding contract to Buy Getty Oil shares, since a pressrelease announced only an 'agreement in principle' which was'subject to the execution of a definitive merger agreement',"according to Gayle.

reut2-010.sgm, WEST AFRICAN CENTRAL BANK SEEKS JOINING IMF TALKS, The Governor of the Central Bank ofWest African CFA franc zone countries (UMOA) today urged thatthe bank should be involved in all negotiations with theInternational Monetary Fund but said the zone's seven membercountries were not thinking of ditching the fund.    Abdoulaye Fadiga told reporters after a regular one-daymeeting of UMOA finance ministers here that the bank'sparticipation in future credit talks with the IMF would promotea greater coherence in Fund aid granted to the region.    But he stresed that UMOA, which last month called for a newrelationship with the IMF, was not contemplating a break withthe fund.    "Member states (of UMOA) never envisaged breaking with theFund," he said.    He said an extraordinary UMOA meeting held in Ivory Coast'sinland capital, Yamoussoukro, last month, stresssed the needfor growth-oriented IMF adjustment policies.    "Borrowing to pay off debts cannot be a solution," Fadigaadded.    UMOA members are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali,Niger, Senegal and Togo. The zone's common-curreny, the CFAfranc, is pegged to the French franc at the rate of 50 CFAfrancs to one French franc.    Fadiga said many of the region's problems stem from lowcommodity prices and a weak dollar.    He applauded last week's agreement between producers andconsumers on the functioning of a new international cocoa pact,saying negotiation of other commodity accords would benefitUMOA countries.

reut2-010.sgm, TALKING POINT/WALL STREET STOCKS, Investors who have been riding thebull market in U.S. stocks got a stinging reminder today of howunexpected news can trigger sharp reversals.    "The market was ripe for some type of pullback," said FrankKorth, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. He said over theweekend, investors pondered President Reagan's decision toimpose tariffs on Japanese electronic goods and some concludedthe step could signal the beginning of a trade war.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 79 points in 30minutes before stabilizing and making a partial recovery.    Korth believes there has been an over-reaction andnear-term traders might want to step in and buy one-half orone-quarter of new investments they have been considering.    "We're still in a bull market," said William Raftery ofSmith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. He thinks history has shownsuch sharp pullbacks are a natural part of bull markets. "Thebear usually strikes slowly," he said.    Raftery noted that blue chips have been forefront of therally that took the market to record highs last week. Intoday's decline, he said, the big name stocks were coming moreinto a more normal alignment with the general market.    Charles Comer of Moseley Securities Corp said ultimatelythe pullback could prove to be a pre-shock to the long awaitedcorrection. But for now he believes the bull market remainsintact. However, it could take several weeks for the market tocomplete a "distribution process" and along the way there willbe rallies.    Comer thinks it is premature to conclude that today'saction signaled formation of a market top. He thinks the marketcan hold in the low to mid 2200 area on the Dow index.    "This probably is the correction that has been expected,"said Crandall Hays of Robert W. Baird Co.    Hays noted that market breadth began to deteriorate lastweek. He said this morning investors saw the dollar downfurther, interest rates up and gold up. "The trade problem gotpeople spooked and and all the bad things were happening atonce," he said.    "This correction could take us down 150 points and we'rehalf-way there now," he said early today.    He thinks the downward move in stock prices could be overin a couple of weeks. Business conditions seem to be gettingbetter according to what he hears from a broad cross-section ofcompanies, from retailers to machinery manufacturers.    "The market was high and people were looking for acorrection, so this was an excuse for the market to go down,"said Alan Ackerman of Gruntal and Co.    He believes investors will be in a mood of extreme cautionor slightly negative for the near term.    Ackerman thinks the U.S. is attempting to "fire a shotacross Japan's bow and let them know we're serious about havingcloser trade ties." But nevertheless investors have beenrattled by "a perception that a full scale trade war ispossible." Ultimately, unless there is an accord, the effectscould be higher interest rates and unemployment, he said.    "I anticipate a further correction later this week," saidHarry Laubscher of Tucker Anthony, R.L. Day. He thinks thepullback was "the start of an overdue correction of between sixand 10 pct from the market highs."    Although investors now have new reason to worry abouthigher interests rate and a return of inflation, Laubschersays, "it is not the end of the bull market."    "The market was looking for a reason to knock itself down alittle bit, and with the trade sanctions coming largely as asurprise, this was the think the market attached itself to,"said Gary Ciminero of Fleet Financial Group.&#3;

reut2-010.sgm, PARIS MEET AGREED NOT TO PUBLISH BANDS - LAWSON, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations inParis last month agreed not to publish any bands in connectionwith their pact to stabilise currencies.    Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about whythe participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawsonreplied, "we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to."When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency floatwith set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said "I do notwant to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as notto make it easy for" speculation against the accord.    Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individualcountries would take corrective action if their currency beganreacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.    But if such movements were due to extraneous factors,Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aidthrough concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.    "It is clear that both Germany and Japan are havingdifficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rateappreciations and making their economies more domesticallyoriented, just as it is taking time for the United States tomake its own economy more export oriented," Lawson said.    In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select TreasuryCommittee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound'scurrent level, adding that "It is an objective ... To try tokeep it around that level."    He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges hadchanged since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because thepound had weathered that period so successfully. "There has beena reassessment of sterling's fundamentals," Lawson said.  Hedisagreed with what he termed "the grossly exaggerated claim"that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those ofother major industrialsed countries.    Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbankrate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a realinterest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did andonly a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average.    Lawson confirmed that "over the medium and longer term, thegovernment's objective is zero inflation."    He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at1.0 pct of GDP "is the modern equivalent of the balanced budgetdoctrine."  He added that "to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remainconstant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simplya recipe for accelerating inflation." Reuter&#3;
