reut2-018.sgm, REAGAN SAYS VOLCKER WILL NOT SERVE NEW TERM, President Reagan said Paul Volcker hasdeclined to serve another term as chairman of the FederalReserve Board, the U.S. central bank. Reagannominated economist Alan Greenspan in his place.    Volcker's term expires in August.    Reagan, in a brief announcement in the White House briefingroom, said he accepted Volcker's decision "with great reluctanceand regret."    Volcker, first appointed to the Fed post by President JimmyCarter in 1979, said "there is a time to leave and a time tocome ... I have no feeling I was being pushed."    Volcker, appearing with Reagan, Greenspan, and TreasurySecretary James Baker in the briefing room, said he will remainon the job until Greenspan's nomination is approved by theSenate.    In a tribute to a smiling Volcker standing beside him,Greenspan told reporters that one of the departing chairman'sgreatest achievements was reducing inflation.    "It will be up to those of us who follow him to be certainthat those very hard won gains will not be lost. Assuring thatwill be one of my primary goals," Greenspan said.    Financial markets reacted with dismay at the departure ofVolcker, who has been widely credited with holding the line oninflation and seeking to maintain stability in currency values.    Immediately following Reagan's announcement, the U.S.dollar weakened sharply against all major currencies and boththe bond and stock markets declined.    But Greenspan told reporters he thought the dollar, whichhas fallen sharply over the past year, has reached its lowpoint.       "There certainly is evidence in that direction," Greenspansaid when reporters asked if the dollar has bottomed out.    The market reaction was probably exaggerated by surprisebecause the announcement followed a number of published reportsthat the White House had decided to reappoint Volcker.    Volcker's tenure at the Fed began under the cloud of majorinflation under Carter with consumer prices rising more than 10per cent annually and the prime interest rate exceeding 20 percent.       With Reagan's backing, Volcker pursued a tight money policythat cut inflation to about three per cent annually and reducedinterest rates to their lowest level in nearly a decade.    The tight money policies were also blamed for producinga deep recession in 1981 and 1982 that caused major politicalproblems for Reagan.    Reagan reappointed Volcker to the chairmanship in 1983.       Greenspan, who heads his own Wall Street consulting firm,was chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic Advisersfrom September 1974 until January 1977.    Greenspan, a Republican, is considered a traditionalconservative economist and has been an adviser to severalpresidents. Reuter&#3;

The ministers were meeting for the first time since the ECExecutive Commission unveiled an emergency budget for 1987aimed at plugging a deficit caused by soaring farm spending andfalling revenues.    The emergency package includes a demand for member statesto pay an extra 1.5 billion European currency units (Ecus) tohelp meet the deficit.    Officials said Britain and West Germany were expected tolead opposition to contributing any extra cash, with the U.Kinsisting instead on a clampdown on runaway farm spending.    The Commission says there will be a shortfall of at leastfive billion Ecus this year, more than 1/8 of total spending.    It hopes to make up much of the shortfall in a one-timeaccounting exercise by paying member states in arrears ratherthan in advance for their spending on Community farm policies.

Belgian Willy de Clercq, EC Commissioner on externalaffairs and trade policy, said high level talks this week withNorway's minority Labour government had helped clarify severalmisconceptions that led to Norway's narrow rejection of ECmembership in a 1972 referendum.    "But you (Norway) cannot be in the club and remain outsidethe club. You can expect equal footing in the club, but not outof it," de Clercq added, referring to Norway's attempts to adaptits EC trade ties in the face of Community moves to launch aninternal trade market from 1992.    The government, worried that the internal market willhamper trade with the EC, which takes about two-thirds ofNorway's exports, last month sent a report to parliament askingpolitical parties and the public to reassess the country'srelationship to the EC.

In that connection, you will recall that, upon myreappointment as chairman in 1983, I felt unable to make a firmcommitment to you or to the Congress to remain in office for asecond full four-year term. Despite my reservations at thetime, that term is in fact now almost finished. However, I dothink, after eight years as chairman, a natural time has nowcome for me to return to private life as soon as reasonablyconvenient and consistent with an orderly transition.Consequently, I do not desire reappointment as chairman and Iplan to resign as governor when a new chairman is prepared toassume office.       I will be leaving with a sense of great appreciation foryour unfailing courtesy to me personally. More broadly, yourconsistent support of the work of the Federal Reserve during aparticularly challenging period for it, for the financialsystem, and for the economy has been critical to whateversuccess we have had.       Without doubt, strong challenges remain for all of thoseinvolved in economic policy. In that effort, I believe thenation will continue to be well served by a strong FederalReserve System -- a system firmly dedicated to fosteringeconomic and financial strength and stability and able to bringto that effort a combination of sound and independentprofessional judgement and continuity beyond any partisanconsiderations.       May I add, too, my personal best wishes for the remainderof your own term in office during which you have done so muchto restore a sense of confidence and self-reliance among theAmerican people.    Faithfully yours,    Paul A Volcker Reuter&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL, The scale of foreign exchange interventionthe Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof ofBritain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreedbetween the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris inFebruary, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.    Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawsontold reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange ratestability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if hefavoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billionstg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.    In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.    Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have beenplaying a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitmentstoward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.    "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.    Asked which techniques were available to preservestability, Lawson said both central bank intervention andinterest rate changes could be used to tackle "the marketpressures there are from time to time."    "Interest rate stability is not an objective in thatsense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.    Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" bydraining excess sterling liquidity from the market through newissues of government securities and foreign currency sales,when the market allowed.    This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,he said.    "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Notnecessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawsonsaid. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale." REUTER&#3;

"I do not know how I come down on this preliminaryinjunction," Gordon said after listening to arguments byattorneys for 1-1/2 days.    "It's been a long time since I was deluged with as muchinformation as I have been. I have to consider what's beenpresented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot bewinners," he said.    Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeovereffort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegallyobtained confidential information about the company to make itsoffer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations ifSamjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc ofCanada, were to succeed.

Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is notgranted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjenslawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would"kill the offer"    Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said thepartnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunctionwere granted. "There's only one Burlington," he said. "If wecannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."    Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings inBurlington for 95 mln dlrs. "We don't want that. We're not inthis for the money," he said.

Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish tradeofficials, said the stable price depended upon output restraintby both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish governmentofficials said.    They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, madethe remarks whilst talking about the connection between ThirdWorld debt and industrialised nations.    Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higherenergy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.    Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around thebeginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrialcountries that depend on imported energy, they would only leadto wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, hesaid.    This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely highprices, he added.    Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a majorcrisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled. REUTER&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY, The Bundesbank is unlikely to changecredit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursdayfor its last session before the Venice summit, bankingeconomists and money market dealers said.    The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last monthby cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and isunlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest ratesin the near future, they said.    The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting willbe followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.    But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference wasusually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, anddid not necessarily herald any policy moves.    Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said todaythere was no reason to cut interest rates because money supplygrowth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar wasstable against the mark.    Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank hasopened a representative office, that the West German economywas now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.    Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold ina 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after theBundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at aminimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.    "They have set this signal and indicated they could maybelower market rates even further, but not with the discount orLombard," Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, saidGerman rates were among the lowest in industrial countries andaround historical lows for West Germany.    A further cut in rates would have little impact on theeconomy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.    The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a moveon interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve."The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder," he said.    A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them inline with the new structure of money market rates since lastmonth, would have little practical significance, dealers said.    The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted adiplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.    But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made itclear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere "eyewash."    Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government tocut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetarypolicy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.    But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced taxcuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budgetdeficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.    "The Bonn government will be in a very weak position inVenice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,"said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.    Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen beforeVenice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. "But Idon't expect any convincing measures," he said.    Money market dealers noted that call money continued tonormalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterdayand as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up bymonth-end distortions.    Call money could come under upwards pressure later thismonth because of a major round of tax payments by banks onbehalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.    Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate fundstomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.    But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank wouldallocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would notrepresent a tightening of policy, however.    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocatesat the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a fullallocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likelyto lift restrictions on private use of the European CurrencyUnit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcementon this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of theSaarland bordering France, and was twice under Frenchoccupation this century.    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to comethis week, as a number of technical and legal matters had stillto be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would betreated for minimum reserve purposes.

reut2-018.sgm, GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS, The West German government's independentcouncil of economic experts believes a further stimulation ofthe economy is inappropriate, government spokesman FriedhelmOst said.    A statement released by Ost after a meeting of ChancellorHelmut Kohl and senior government officials with the councilsaid the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to twopct was achievable.    It added the council believed "an intensification of thealready expansionary stimulation of monetary and financialpolicy is not called for."    Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure onWest Germany to adapt to external economic factors would notincrease.    The government regularly uses the term "changed externaleconomic factors" when referring to the fall of the dollar,which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officialshave said they expect exports to pick up during the year, butcould still fall below the 1986 level.    Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germanyagreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris inFebruary aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.    The stance taken by the experts backs up the officialposition of the West German government ahead of next week'sseven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to bepressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.    West German government officials have stressed Bonn is notin a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts duenext year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.    The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in officialinterest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.    The experts' prediction for economic growth this year ofbetween 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from aforecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.    Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The governmentitself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986. REUTER&#3;

They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked atJapan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pactyesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.    But there was no hint what the announcement might be.    Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to behonoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.    But they also noted that the White House has said it wasunlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of theworld's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.    The officials added that while the curbs complicatedU.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was nottaking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.    Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation forJapan's failure to honor commitments to end dumpingsemiconductors in world markets at less than production costsand to open its own market to U.S. goods.    The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese televisionsets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.

Ahmanson's stock fell 1-1/8 to 20-1/8 in active trading.    Hottensen was unavailable for comment, but a spokeswomanfor Goldman Sachs said the reason for the reduction in earningsestimates is the decline in demand for mortgage loans asinterest rates move higher. Mortgage rates moved to doubledigits in april for the first time since last summer.    The Goldman spokeswoman said that sales of adjustable ratemortgages was a significant factor in Hottensen's originalearnings estimates.    Last year, when the company's net income was 3.22 dlrs ashare, Ahmanson generated more than half of its 541 mln dlrs ofpretax income from gains on loan sales, the spokeswoman said.    She said the reduction in earnings estimates to 2.60 dlrs ashare in 1987 from a previous estimate of 3.30 dlrs, reflectsless optimism with the mortgage loan environment.    In the present environment for mortgages, the spokeswomansaid, Ahmanson's second quarter earnings should drop to 45 ctsa share from last year's 80 cts a share.    Hottnesen expects the savings and loan to earn between 2.90dlrs and 3.10 dlrs a share in 1988. he had previously estimatedearnings of 3.30 dlrs a share in 1988. Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, LEUTWILER WANTS FIRMER MARK AGAINST SFR, Fritz Leutwiler, chairman ofBBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bankpresident, urged the National Bank to declare its intent ofachieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.    In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, "A graduallyrising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would bedesirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and withregard to sustaining Swiss industry."    "Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank ofissue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect," hesaid.    Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss centralbank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank'starget of monetary stability.    "Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, haveto be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetarypolicy," he told shareholders. "Realistically there is in fact nopersuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20pct lower than the Swiss."    A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark andSwiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over along period of time.    The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influenceindividual parities separately.    Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not supportthe value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other centralbanks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.    "I would be the last to recommend that. The key to astronger dollar lies in the United States itself," Leutwilersaid. REUTER&#3;

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company alsosaid its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 topexecutives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their basesalary if they stay with the company through August 29.    In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiaryof Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.    The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with twoCiba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject theSwiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanleyand Co Inc, that it is "inadequate and unfair from a financialpoint of view to the holders of shares," the company said.    The board also authorized a special committee and MorganStanley to "vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize anyalternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'investment in the company," the company said.    Among the alternatives the special committee will considerare a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, includingself tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use ofdividends, Spectra-Physics said.    The "retention plan" for the 52 top officers will pay anaverage bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.    Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan "in orderto encourage key operating personnel to remain with the companyduring the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the(Ciba-Geigy) offer."    Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to theircash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasonsother than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave thecompany because their salaries have been sharply cut.    Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigyyesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., chargingit with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading inviolation of securities law and with violating the intent ofJuly 9, 1985 standstill agreement.    Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time ofthe standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicitedtakeover proposal for the company and that the intent of theagreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.    Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and RelianceGroup Holdings &lt;REL>, which is controlled by New York investorSaul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.    Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy fromraising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unlessanother person get more than 10 pct of its voting power. Reuter&#3;

"The designation of these loans as non-accrual reduced thebank's earnings by about 22 mln dlrs after tax," chairman AllanTaylor said in a statement. "Without this reduction,second-quarter earnings would have been about 138 mln dlrs," a10 pct increase over last year's profit, Taylor said.    The bank earlier reported second quarter profit fell to116.2 mln dlrs from 125.1 mln dlrs a year ago.    The bank said domestic earnings rose to a record 125 mlndlrs in the second quarter, a 52 mln dlr increase from the yearbefore, due to higher business volumes and securities gains aswell as a better yield from its domestic non-accrual loanportfolio.    It said international operations reported a net after-taxloss of nine mln dlrs, compared with a 52 mln dlr profit lastyear. The decline largely reflects the impact of Brazil'ssuspended interest payments, which resulted in about a 40 mlndlr reduction in net interest income, Royal Bank said.    Royal Bank said it keeping its 1987 loan loss experienceestimate unchanged from the last quarter at one billion dlrs.It said it is committed to building its general provision forloan losses to at least 20 pct of total outstanding loans totroubled sovereign borrowers by the end of 1989.

reut2-018.sgm, SMALL RISE SEEN IN U.S. GASOLINE INVENTORIES, U.S. analysts expect the AmericanPetroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to showa slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week endedMay 29, oil traders and analysts said.    While the consensus is for an increase, a few would notrule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said thatbarring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect thereport to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.    Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to besteady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oilprices, the analysts said.    Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming importscontinue at relatively high levels.    Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mlnbarrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.    Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, wholooks for a build said, "We have had five weeks of gasolinedemand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off tobetween 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demandwould have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw," he added.    Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a drawin stocks of about of about one mln barrels.       The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latestreport for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasolinedemand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.    But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely tofounder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.    Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and addto U.S. stocks.    But some analysts said that refiners may have held refineryruns.    Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel levelreported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks wasdiscounted as having a market impact at this time.    "A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,"one futures analyst said.    Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to buildbetween 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrelsreported by API for the week of may 22.

But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economicsanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyochanged its sales policies concerning computer microchips.    Speaking in a televised news conference linking severalEuropean capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that theJapanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic andglobal demand.    "There is an even greater amount of stimulus than wasoriginally thought," said Shultz, speaking from Washington.    "It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talkedabout when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.    "It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believethat getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating theeconomy," he added.    But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the newsconference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Mightdecide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions onsome Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:    "These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of anagreement that had been reached between the United States andJapan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chipmarket.    "They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to theagreement that it made become evident."    He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor thesituation for a month and that it was impossible to determine atrend on only one month's data.    The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personalcomputers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging thatJapan had violated last September's bilateral agreement byselling computer chips at below fair market value.    Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also dowell to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.    Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies totake action to stimulate the world economy without a boldAmerican initiative to reduce the size of the federal budgetdeficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle theproblem.    He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficitwould probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs againstlast year, and that the budget being worked on this year wouldcontain a major reduction.

Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific(ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit theexports of 26 ACP countries.    They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedureslaid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relationsbetween ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affecttrade between the two sides.    They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertakingnot to bring in new protectionist measures during the currentPunta del Este round of world trade negotiations being heldunder GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.    The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 Europeancurrency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-producedvegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which couldraise up to two billion Ecus a year.    EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at amarathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg onJune 15.    Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries areconvinced this would lead to EC industry substituting productsmade within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimatesthis would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in itsmember country exports.    "We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures toundermine our countries, but such would be the impact of thesemeasures," Wilson said.    The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hitby the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if itis approved.    Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only "as a verylast resort," but added that the ACP is in touch with othercountries which oppose the plan.    Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clearJamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does notexport oils and fats.    Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast,Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says. Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY, Nearby months in soybean and soymealfutures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply oflivestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep thenew crop outlook bearish, traders said.    "A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worriedabout where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers forthe few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with aDecatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bidanother two cents today to 10 over July futures.    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willingto sell, dealers said.    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the beliefthat even if futures rally back to last month's highs, countrymovement may remain light because farmers in many areas aresold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern halfof the Midwest.    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtimefor maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducingthe weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping thespot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help Julysoybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal hasalready moved to a premium over the August through Octobermonths and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may alsomove to a July premium later this month, they added. Reuter&#3;

"I think our earnings have not peaked," Zimmerman said ofNoranda Forest, which will be Canada's largest forest productscompany. Noranda previously said it is spinning off its vastforest product holdings into the new company and is now makingan initial public offering of Noranda Forest shares.       Zimmerman told Reuters that he agrees with one forestindustry analyst's prediction that Noranda Forest will earn atleast 165 mln dlrs in 1987.    Noranda Forest's preliminary share prospectus, releasedtoday, shows the company had 1986 pro forma earnings of 80.2mln dlrs, excluding a 22.5 mln dlr extraordinary gain.    Asked to comment on the analyst's forecast that Norandacould earn about 200 mln dlrs this year, Zimmerman said, "Ithink that he is directionally very correct."    He also said Noranda Forest will consolidate financialresults of 50 pct-owned MacMillan Bloedel Ltd &lt;MB.TO>.    Zimmerman said Noranda Forest expects to raise at least 350mln dlrs from its first share issue, making it one of Canada'slargest initial public offerings.    Noranda Forest intends to issue about 15 pct of its commonshares to the public at first, but parent company Noranda Inc"is prepared to let up to 49 pct of it go into the public hands,"he added. Noranda Inc now holds all of the 79.9 mln outstandingshares of Noranda Forest.    Zimmerman declined to say when future secondary shareofferings might occur, although he said they will be made "assoon as it's right" for either cash or other securities.    Proceeds from the share issue will be used mainly to reduceNoranda Forest's long term debt, listed pro forma as 1.36billion dlrs at the end of first quarter, 1987, chairmanZimmerman said.    Noranda Forest's first priority will be to continue cuttingdebt to "a comfortable, manageable level in all likely futurecircumstances" or about 30 pct of capital, he said.    "I think we learned last time around that although yourassets can support a high levels of debt, earnings can'tsupport associated interest in times of high interest rates,"Zimmerman commented.    Noranda Forest had pro forma operating losses of 8.6 mlndlrs in 1985 and 2.9 mln dlrs in 1984 during periods of higherinterest rates.    The company's pro forma 1987 first quarter results showednet profit of 42.2 mln dlrs or 49 cts a share, up from earningsof 4.7 mln dlrs or one ct a share, excluding a 22.5 mln dlrextraordinary gain, in the prior year.    Zimmerman also said the company will concentrate onmaintaining quality earnings from existing operations ratherthan increasing operating volumes. "We are likely to spend moneyto enhance our operations ahead of expanding them," he said.    Noranda Forest would also be interested in buying the 50pct interest it does not already own in Northwood Pulp andTimber Ltd from Mead Corp &lt;MEA> for between 150 mln and 200 mlndlrs, Zimmerman said.    Noranda Forest and Mead each have the right of firstrefusal the other's Northwood holding, but Mead likely is notanxious to sell, he added.    Noranda Forest's initial dividend policy will be to pay 10cents a share quarterly. When asked, Zimmerman agreed thedividend was small compared to cash flow, adding the companywill later "establish a typical or sensible dividend policy." Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, OVERSEAS &lt;OSG> SEES OPEC QUOTAS KEY TO RATES, Overseas Shipholding Group Inc presidentMorton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during thesecond half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should riseaccordingly.    Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholdersmeeting, said international tanker markets were generally weakthroughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPECoil production has picked up. The result has been a modestimprovement in tanker rates.    Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.       He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 asOPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.    For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net incomeof 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mlndlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a yearago.    The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,or 1.45 dlrs per share.       "The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after fouryears of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeittemporary, rise in freight rates in the international tankermarkets last summer," Hyman said.    He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principalsource of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, whichrepresents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.

"No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protectingall shipping in those waters," Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims saidas the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase theprotective U.S. military presence in the gulf.    Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense SecretaryCaspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutralshipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.    "As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels areunder our protection with the exception, on a limitedcase-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign MilitarySales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in theregion," Sims said.    U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaitiship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain andKuwait.

reut2-018.sgm, U.K. BANKERS LAUD VOLCKER, UNSURE ABOUT GREENSPAN, U.K. Bankers for the most part laudedoutgoing U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker for hisachievements over the past eight years but expressed someuncertainty about economist Alan Greenspan, nominated byPresident Reagan to succeed him.    "One of Volcker's greatest achievements was the sense ofcontinuity and stability he gave to the international markets,"said Carlos Santistevan, executive director of Libra Bank Plc.However, it is uncertain how long it will take for Greenspan tofill that role and the degree to which he can do so, he said.    Greenspan heads his own financial consulting firm,Townesend, Greenspan Associates Inc and was Chairman of theCouncil of Economic Advisers during the Ford Administration.    "He is a prominent and well known figure in the U.S." saidDavid Lomax, Group Economics Adviser at National WestminsterBank Plc, who described Greenspan as an "orthodox Republicaneconomist" who may be better suited to getting the U.S. Economyon track than Volcker.    But for the most part bankers in London are unfamiliar withGreenspan's views on domestic and international economics orthe international debt crisis.    "I will be sad to see Volcker go. He is a central banker ofgood repute with a general interest in protecting the U.S. Andinternational banking system," said Libra's Santistevan.    Volcker knows and understands the problems facing indebtedcountries, he said, adding that it is unlikely Greenspan is asfamiliar with the problem and the personalities involved.    For this reason he expects there will be little change inthe Fed's approach to the debt crisis, even as U.S. Commercialbanks take a harder line in dealing with the problem by addingbillions of dollars in reserves against possible losses onthird world debt.    Another senior banker who deals with the Latin Americandebt problem also doubted there would be much changepost-Volcker, but for other reasons.    He said that despite U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker'sdebt initiative which called for greater contributions bybanks, governments and multilateral organization, government'shave done little to try to improve the situation, leaving thebulk of the responsibility in the hands of the bankers.    Despite the Fed's independence from central government, hequestioned how much impact Greenspan could have coming into thejob so close to the next Presidential election.    News that Volcker would not seek a third term hit thefinancial markets hard.  The U.S. Dollar fell sharply onforeign exchange markets before reported concerted central bankintervention by the Fed and the Bundesbank helped it recoversomewhat. Prices of Eurodollar denominated bonds fell about onepoint, while prices of U.S. Treasury bonds traded here lostmore than one point.    But despite the disruption in the markets, Lloyds BankPlc's Group Economic Adivser Christopher Johnson said theannouncement was well-timed, given the recent rise in thedollar against the mark and yen.    In recent statements U.S. Officials have said the dollarhas fallen far enough and at a White House briefing todayannouncing his nomination Greenspan said "there certainly isevidence" that the dollar had bottomed out.    However, many economists here believe that the recent risein the dollar will be only temporary and that it will have tofall further before America's huge trade deficit begins toreverse.    "The dollar has further to fall, although it may take a fewyears" said Lloyds Bank's Johnson. He added that the importantthing is that there is a soft landing.    Like other economists, Johnson is anxious to hearGreenspan's testify at the Congressional confirmation hearings.    "He has everything going for him but he must establishcredibility. We have to hear his views on inflation and theoutlook for interest rates," he said.    Some bankers criticized Volcker for taking too hard astance in combating inflation in the late 1970's when histightening in U.S. Monetary policy pushed interest rates torecord levels.    "He tightened more than the Republicans wanted and onlyrelaxed his stance when the Latin American debt crisis erupted(in 1982)," National Westminster's Lomax said.    Lomax said that Greenspan, if appointed, will inherit theagreements entered into by Volcker with other members of theGroup of Five industrial nations on the dollar.    However, he said that the danger lies in dollar stabilitybeing maintained because of a monetary policy that is tootight. Too firm a monetary policy could send the U.S. Intorecession, which would not be welcome by European counterparts,he said. Reuter&#3;

Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,Black said, "That would not be wildly inaccurate," although hedeclined to disclose the actual cost.    Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspapergroup, with three French language daily newspapers in QuebecCity, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants inOntario and Quebec.    Black added that Hollinger would also continue seekingacquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23dailies.    "There is really no end to the ones that are available," hetold reporters, although he added that most remainingacquisition opportunities are in the U.S.    He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,of London, should become profitable in this year's fourthquarter.       For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even orbetter, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs andimproved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largestcirculation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadiandlrs last year.    Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight toldreporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's dailycirculation had risen by 25,000 since September to about1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the newIndependent daily newspaper.       Knight said The Independent was not affecting theTelegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulationof other London quality dailies such as The Times and TheGuardian.    Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,including extraordinary gains from previous sales ofdiscontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after anextraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.       Black told shareholders that first quarter operatingearnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrsagainst a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.

A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press forcontinuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status forRomania had been "exceptionally difficult" and came after "alloptions were seriously considered."    But the statement said that despite concerns about humanrights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president haddecided that should be continued because it helped stimulateemigration from Romania and gave the United States influence onhuman rights practices there.    The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congressrequests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungaryand China.    The House of Representatives has attached to a trade billlegislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pendingcertification by Reagan that the country had made progress onhuman rights.

reut2-018.sgm, NO PROSPECT IN SIGHT OF EC BUDGET ACCORD, The European Community was set toplunge into an ever-deepening budget crisis after ministersfailed to reach agreement on plugging a gap in thenear-bankrupt Community's finances, diplomats said.    As EC budget ministers ended six hours of talks inLuxembourg, diplomats said there was little basis for an accordamongst the trading bloc's 12 member states.    The EC executive Commission says the Community faces adeficit this year of at least five billion European CurrencyUnits and could be forced to choose between massive spendingcuts or bankruptcy.    It has appealed to member states to pay an extra 1.5billion ECUs to help meet the deficit, caused by soaring farmspending and falling revenues.    But hardliners Britain and West Germany have insisted thatthere can be no extra cash for the Community this year andinstead call for a clampdown on farm spending, which absorbstwo thirds of the EC budget.    "We have to make clear that expenses should be based onincome," West German Minister of State Hans Tietmeyer toldreporters.    "There is no way the Germans will agree to extra financingin the form of national contributions," he added.    A second Commission proposal, which would plug most of thebudget gap by paying member states in arrears rather than inadvance for their spending on Community farm policies, was alsofar from agreement, diplomats added.    The proposal, strongly backed by Britain and West Germany,would save up to four billion ECUs if payments were delayed fortwo months.    But poorer member states, which would have to borrow fundsto cover the delay, complain the change in the system wouldunfairly impose too much of the burden on them.    The European Parliament is also expected to refuse an earlydebate on the changeover in the farm payments system, furtherdelaying any moves to solve the deficit problem, parliamentarysources said.

The company had not "really seen any major change" indemand, vice president of group marketing, J. David Lyons, toldReuters in an interview. "Our sales have been moderate to flat,but certainly not down," Lyons said.    Data General president Edson de Castro declined to commenton his outlook for the computer industry or on the company'sperformance.       Wall Street analysts said they were not surprised by theless than confident message from Data General which earliertoday announced computer networking products to link personalcomputers with networks of its minicomputers and computers fromother vendors.    "They've tried a number of different things that haven'tseemed to work," said Paine Webber analyst Stephen Smith. "DataGeneral is finding that aggressive pricing alone isn't enough"to win sales," Smith said.    In the second quarter ended March 31, Data General postedan operating loss of 24.4 mln dlrs, or 91 cts a share, comparedto earnings of 2.0 mln dlrs, or eight cts a share, a yearearlier. Sales for the quarter fell to 315.2 mln dlrs from318.8 mln dlrs.    Despite reports of an upturn in sales at rivals DigitalEquipment Corp &lt;DEC> and International Business Machines Corp&lt;IBM>, Data General said it was not convinced that theminicomputer market had emerged from a two-year slump.    "We would rather wait until we see a sustained improvementin orders," Lyons said.       Lyons said new hardware and software introduced by thecompany are a response to customers who want to tie togethertheir growing number of PCs and to connect them with largermini and mainframe computers.    He said the products are part of a new strategy ofproviding industry-standard systems that allow computers fromdifferent vendors to share and exchange information.       Analysts noted that Data General is one of many companiespromoting the integration of PCs with other office computers.    "PC integration is a tough strategy," said Smith.    "A lot of people are coming to the market from a lot ofdifferent angles," he said. Reuter&#3;

The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17thIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision toprotect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags-- effectively making them American ships.

The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by theDemocratic and Republican congressional leadership and theadministration -- which demanded a report within seven days onplans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.

reut2-018.sgm, DEUTSCHE BANK SAYS NO SUPPORT FOR VW MANAGEMENT, West Germany's biggestbank said it would withhold support from Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>management at next month's annual meeting because of the VWcurrency scandal.    Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> said it would abstain in votesexonerating VW management and the supervisory board, whichrepresents shareholders and employees, unless an auditor'sreport on the currency scandal is published before the July 2annual meeting and either clearly absolves or blames themanagement and board.    Several shareholder groups have said they will vote againstmanagement at what promises to be a stormy annual meeting. If amajority of shareholders back these groups, the top managementof Europe's biggest carmaker could be dismissed.    Deutsche said it expected the results of the auditor'sreport on the currency fraud, which cost VW some 260 mln dlrs,to be published before the annual meeting.    But in a letter to Deutsche customers depositing their VWshares at the bank, Deutsche wrote: "Without knowledge of theseresults, we do not think we are in a position to make you asuggestion for or against exoneration of the management boardand supervisory board."    "Unless you give us instructions to the contrary, we willabstain with your shares ... but we reserve the right to votefor or against exoneration of the management board andsupervisory board, if this seems in your interest in line withthe results of the auditor's report," it added.    A strong shareholder vote against the management wouldempower the supervisory board to dismiss the management if itchooses, though such a move would not be mandatory.    A member of the supervisory board who does not receiveexoneration at an annual meeting may have to step down.    An abstention or no-vote by banks on behalf of customersagainst management would in itself be a vote of no confidence.    German banks traditionally use their huge proxy votes atannual meetings to support the management of the company, inwhich they are often represented on the supervisory board.    VW management board chairman Carl Hahn said in April that1986 profits had been hit by the scandal, in which documentsrelating to currency arbitrage were allegedly faked, butprofits for 1987 would not be affected.    Following the scandal, finance director Rolf Selowskyresigned, and former chief dealer Bobby Junger was arrested.    Deutsche represents 8-10 pct of VW's share capital, thesources said, and F. Wilhelm Christians, one of the bank's twomanagement board spokesmen (chief executives) is on the VWsupervisory board.    Banking sources said Deutsche was furious with VW after thebank led an international placement of VW shares from thecompany's record rights issue last September.    Less than two months later VW announced a sharp fall ininterim profits, bashing its share price and severely dentingconfidence in the German share market generally.    A spokesman for the Savings Bank Association said thatGerman savings banks would vote not to discharge Selowsky, anddepending on whether the auditor's report was published wouldabstain on the vote for other management board members.    The federal government and the state of Lower Saxonytogether have 40 pct of VW shareholders' votes. It is stillunclear how they will vote. Associations representing smallshareholders will also ensure the annual meeting is heated.    The Protective Association for Securities Ownership hassaid it will vote against the entire management board, and theProtective Society for Small Shareholders will also voteagainst the supervisory board.    A spokeswoman for Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG, theauditors commissioned by VW in March to investigate thescandal, declined to comment when its report would be issued. Reuter&#3;

"Our customers in this country are living off the tailgatesof our trucks," he said, referring to tightness of supply andstrong demand. "The fundamentals are good."       Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said;"All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored."    He said copper supplies are lower than they have been foralmost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest onrecord behind 1984, he said.    Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, withannual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.       During the interview, executive vice president DouglasYearley said he believed it was only a matter of time beforethe copper price rose "because there aren't that many newprojects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,will continue to grow modestly."    Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound tomore than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a poundrise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings forPhelps Dodge, the company said.

New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mineowned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's&lt;BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge'sown expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by productionshortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.

reut2-018.sgm, U.S. WHEAT IN SENEGAL MARKET -- USDA, After a highly favorable reception ofa trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flourlast February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery ofa first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, thedepartment noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheatunder the Export Enhancement Program last November, but localopposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has beendelaying deliveries.    As a result there were a series of baking seminars as wellas the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millersand convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.    The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegalremain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market thathad been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly Frenchwheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.

The company's stock closed at 50, off 1-1/4.    Sosnick said "sluggish sales cloud the economic picture andconcern about the outlook for credit income diminish Sears'near-term investment prospects." He said the retail sales inMay were weak, which would mean sales have been below plan forthe past two months.    Sosnick said indications are that Sears may not be asstrong a performer as other retailers.    However, he said his earnings estimate for the company for1987 remains unchanged at 4.50 dlrs a share compared to 3.62dlrs a share in 1986. He added that "as a result of weakeningsales momentum, we have less confidence in that estimate."    The analyst said it projects second quarter earnings in the1.05 to 1.10 dlrs a share range, up from 77 cts a year ago. The1987 estimate includes an 18 ct a share gain from the sale of50 savings bank branches and strong earnings contribution fromAllstate Insurance. Reuter&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, VOLCKER LEAVING DESPITE REAGAN REQUESTS TO STAY, Paul Volcker's departure as FederalReserve Board chairman came despite pleas from the Reaganadministration that he stay at the helm of the U.S. centralbank, U.S. officials said.    "The President made it very clear that he would be very,very pleased had the chairman's decision been otherwise,"Treasury Secretary James Baker said.    A Reagan administration official, who asked not to beidentified, said Baker too had urged Volcker repeatedly in thepast several months to consider staying on as chairman.    But there were no indications the administration had toldVolcker that it was in the national interest for him to stayand that current global economic uncertainties required it.    Associates of Volcker have assumed Volcker would only havestayed on in such circumstances. "He doesn't care a lot,emotionally, about a third term," Nikko Securities vice-chairmanStephen Alixrod, until last year a top Fed staffer, toldReuters recently.    Officials are confident that newly-nominated chairman AlanGreenspan will re-establish close working relations with Bakerand his credentials eventually will calm markets.    One Reagan administration economic policymaker, who askednot to be named, pointed out that Baker and Greenspan workedtogether closely in the Ford administration.    At the time, Baker was acting Secretary of Commerce andGreenspan headed the President's Council of Economic Advisers.    Reagan administration officials made clear, meanwhile, thatthe announcement, precipitated by Volcker's unshakeabledecision to quit, came in order to clear up uncertainty aheadof the Summit of leading industrial democracies in Venice.    President Reagan might have been in an embarrassingposition if no decision had been made by then.    Volcker enjoys the respect of most top economic officialsabroad, and is admired at the West German Bundesbank, and inTokyo, despite his criticism  of Japanese policies.    Financial markets, possibly reflecting some of thedisappointment in foreign capitals, drove the dollar sharplylower on news of his departure, prompting central bankintervention to stem the fall, dealers said.    Finance Ministries and central banks of the other summitnations -- Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy andCanada -- were informed shortly before the news was announced,Baker told reporters today.    Monetary sources also said one reason Volcker decided toresign was his personal financial situation and his marriage -- his wife lives in New York and did not want him to take up asecond term in mid-1983.    Volcker has foregone potentially million-dollar salaries toa life almost overwhelmingly devoted to public service at payrates low relative to his financial commitments.    Both these reasons at one time prompted him to considerstepping down before his second term was completed.    But Volcker also hinted there might be more than personalreasons for his decision. "It was a personal decision, takingaccount of a lot of things, including purely personalconsiderations and others," he told reporters.    Fed sources note Volcker's considerable unease at the lackof progress by the administration in reaching a budget deficitreduction agreement.    In addition, Volcker would have faced four more years witha Board that he was less than comfortable with, monetarysources say. The other five members are Reagan appointees.    What may unsettle markets, however, is the fact that theFed governors now have only six to seven years' collectiveexperience between them, at a time of great financialuncertainty.    Analysts said that while Greenspan might well be consideredas tough an inflation-fighter as Volcker, his Republicancredentials could make him more of a political Fed chairmanthan Volcker.    An administration official said Volcker was consulted onGreenspan "and very much approved of his replacement."    But one analyst compared Greenspan's relationship to theadministration, to whom he has been an unofficial economicadviser, with the relationship former chairman Arthur Burns hadwith the Nixon administration.    Burns was somewhat more sympathetic to the administrationviewpoint than Volcker has been, and Burns was less willing tomake radical policy changes.    Making clear his decision was a strong one, Volcker toldreporters, "I told (Reagan) with considerable definitivenessyesterday." Administration officials said Volcker arrived at theWhite House yesterday afternoon with his resignation.    When renominated in mid-1983, Volcker said he wouldprobably step down within two years. Monetary sources said thedeparture of Donald Regan as Treasury Secretary was one factorthat convinced him to stay on. Regan and Volcker clashed almostfrom the start of the administration.    Another, these sources said, was the prospect of being ableto work with Baker as Treasury Secretary to tackle theinternational debt crisis and deal with the then high-flyingdollar. Reuter&#3;

The company said the write-off of the FSLIC asset wasprompted by a recent General Accounting Office report thatdeclared the FSLIC technically insolvent.    The company said it also received a letter from the FSLICinforming Ahmanson that it will not honor its long-standingobligation to Ahmanson's Home Savings of America unit, as wellas to hundreds of other thrifts.

reut2-018.sgm, INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY, With more private investment, not moreprotection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitivewith the most modern foreign producers, analysts from twocongressional agencies said today.    The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm ofCongress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearingthere was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason foroptimism than a few years ago.    "While textile producers are making significantinvestments, they could do more," OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisanbudget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loanguarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather thanincreased trade protection which could lead to foreignretaliation.    CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit forprofits and investments of domestic firms.    Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said theagencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion againstcongressional approval of protectionist textile quotalegislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and otherAsian textile producing countries.    President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection billbut it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and isexpected to be voted on in the House this year.    However, approval this year is in doubt because passage ofa major trade bill without specific protections for textilesshowed a weakening of support for the legislation.    Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreignproducers in the use of modern textile and apparel productionequipment and net imports are growing faster than the domesticmarkets, Kelly said.    He added that private investment in the textile andclothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-sevenththe average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.    Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports oftextiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pctwhile U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.    "The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced bynew technology, imports, or some combination of both. While theindustry may not be able to compete in all domestic marketsthat it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our researchindicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,and that exports can be expanded," Kelly said.

reut2-018.sgm, PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION, Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. RobertDurham said the company is prepared to make another largenon-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in thenear future.    In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company wasexamining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.    He declined to name the companies but said a deal couldoccur as soon as the second half of 1987.       Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer inthe U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian ChemicalsCo, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tiresamong other products.    The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify andeventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copperoperations.    Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrsto buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.       Any acquisition candidate would have to have a differenteconomic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and goodmanagement, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendlydeal, he added.    "We're not talking high-tech, or financial services orabout a perfume company," he said. "We want a good basicindustrial company that will fit into our managementstructure," Durham said.       During the interview, Durham and other executives also saidcontinued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead tohigher prices for the metal.    "In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price(for copper) will improve because there aren't that many newprojects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,will continue to grow modestly," said executive vice presidentDouglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost ofproducing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest andcorporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.    Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound nowcompared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analystssaid.    Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have beenfor almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.    He declined to project results for the second quarter oryear. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise incopper prices in the last month will help results.    Durham said last month that the second quarter should matchthe first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mlndlrs or 49 cts a share.    First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increasedcopper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, alsoacquired last year.

reut2-018.sgm, U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION, The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration toprovide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does notplace any restrictions on its actions.    The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirdsof those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an allianceof liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought todefeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislatorsoppose President Reagan's policies in the region.    The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17thIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --effectively making them American ships.    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic andRepublican leadership as well as by the administration --required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide areport to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans toprotect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.    It did not, however, place any restrictions on theadministration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships andthus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation thisweek. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.    Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only afirst step toward a greater congressional involvement informulating policy.

He was being questioned by the congressional Iran-contrapanel about testimony he gave to the House Foreign AffairsCommittee on October 15, 1986, saying no U.S. intelligence,defense or other government official was involved in theflight.    "I made those statements and I made a similar statement onOctober 14 to Secretary (of State George) Shultz. And every oneof those statements was completely honest and completely wrong,"Abrams testified.    Two of the crew of the downed aircraft, operating out of ElSalvador, were killed. The third, Eugene Hasenfus, wascaptured, tried and sentenced to 30 years' jail, but laterreleased by the Nicaraguan authorities.    Abrams -- the highest-ranking member of the administrationto testify in five weeks of televised hearings -- said he didnot remember how he learned that the plane had been shot down,but thought it was probably from the CIA.    He said he made public statements within a couple of daysthat there had been no U.S. government involvement after makinginquiries of the CIA, the National Security Council and thePentagon.

The SEC charged Jose Arrojo, a vice president of a Windsorsubsidiary, Ronald Kahn, former vice of the company, and DavidGarvin, former president of a Windsor subsidiary, with takingpart in a scheme to inflate the value of Windsor's 1982year-end inventory, resulting in a 2.0 mln dlr overstatement ofthe company's pre-tax income for that year.

reut2-018.sgm, U.S. MEAT INDUSTRY LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN IN JAPAN, The U.S. meat industry has launched anaggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumerawareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government torelax current beef import quotas.    U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrsannually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as highas six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas wereremoved and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of theattributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat ExportFederation said at a press conference today.    Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through theAgriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan waslaunched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April.    "The promising Japanese beef market could be one of thebright spots for U.S. agricultural exports," said Philip Seng,Asian Director for the Federation. "We supply and they (Japan)buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want tobuy more," he said.    Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limitstotal Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expandingU.S. beef shipments to Japan.    The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavyJapanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreementexpires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to getunderway this fall.    The Reagan administration has called for an end to thequotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said theywould not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure.    Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters thatthey do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but thatthey hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.    High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected markethas also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industryofficials said.    Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrsfor a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat associationsaid. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrsper pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb.    Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beefper year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,officials said.    Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and adecrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mlntonnes.

reut2-018.sgm, VOLCKER LEAVES VOID ON LDC DEBT, BANKERS SAY, Paul Volcker's resignation as FederalReserve Board chairman creates a serious leadership vacuum at atime of deep uncertainty about the future management of thethird-world debt crisis, bankers said.    They said Volcker did more than any other official to holdthe financial system together when Mexico halted interestpayments in August 1982 and has played a central role eversince.    "Where is the leadership going to come from? Suddenlythere's a terrible void," one New York banker said.    Volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missedbecause International Monetary Fund managing director MichelCamdessus is new to his job and Barber Conable is finding ithard to make a mark as World Bank president, bankers said.    Moreover, Volcker's successor, Alan Greenspan, has littleexperience of international affairs and third world debt.    "Greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issuesand the sense of understanding of their complexity that Volckerhas. Volcker understands what motivates people outside the U.S.That was in his gut. Greenspan just does not have the intuitivefeeling," one banker said.    This banker, who has discussed debt questions withGreenspan, described his views as simplistic.    But Robert Hormats of Goldman, Sachs and Co said he was notworried by Greenspan's lack of international experience.    "People rush to judgment, but once they get to knowGreenspan I'm sure they'll find him an excellent replacement,"said Hormats, a former Administration official.    Anyone nominated to replace Volcker would have paled in theinitial comparison, Hormats said. "Volcker had the status of afinancial demigod and you can't attain that status overnight,"he said.    One veteran debt rescheduler said Volcker, together withthe Bank of England, deserves credit for keeping the bankingsystem intact after Mexico's default.    "If it hadn't been for him, the world would look a lotdifferent now," he said. "Whether you agreed with him or not,he has a superb grasp of ideas."    Certainly, not all bankers did agree all the time withVolcker. In particular, he was roundly criticized by some formore or less forcing them last September to grant Mexicogenerous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debtrescheduling agreement.    "Volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping thebounds and pushing the package onto the banks," commented onebanker who helped to negotiate the Mexican deal.    Another critic was Citicorp chairman John Reed, who saidthe 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders andthus delay Mexico's return to the voluntary markets.    It was a review of the fate of the Mexican deal - and ofothers that followed it for Chile, Venezuela, the Philippinesand Argentina - that helped to convince Reed that the debtcrisis was not about to be solved and that Citicorp needed tobolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.    "It certainly contributed to the general feeling ofmalaise," one Citicorp banker said in describing the impact ofthe Mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billiondlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses.    That decision, since followed by Chase Manhattan andSecurity Pacific Corp, may profoundly alter the strategy ofcreditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis.    But no one is sure what the impact will be. "It's verydifficult for anyone to know which way the debt problem isgoing, and with Volcker out of the picture it just adds to theuncertainty," one banker said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES, Currency futures are likely to movehigher following the sharp rally today after President Reaganannounced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term asFederal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominatedas his replacement, currency analysts said.    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices betweennow and the June 8 Venice economic summit.    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude tothe dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,analysts said.    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearinga bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks inChicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was atechnical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,analysts said.       "Disappointment of European central bankers over theappointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollarlower," said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president CarolMackoff.    "The international community will not like thisappointment," as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy andthat Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought toreduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst DavidHorner.     Furthermore, "that Greenspan was not named two months agosuggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"Horner said.    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futuresprior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigatedonly by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the G-7summit, he said.    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, maybe at an impasse, analysts said.    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neitherplanned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from theU.S. to do so, Mackoff said.    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficitas Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut itsbudget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in thedollar could be forestalled, Horner said.    However, "the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothingchanges," Horner said.    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloanesaid European currencies will likely move to the higher end oftheir 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.    For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yenfutures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said Septembermarks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swissfrancs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950. Reuter&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, WORLD BANK SUSPENDS LOANS TO PERU - CENTRAL BANK, The World Bank has suspended loans to Perubecause the country has over two months of payment arrears withthe lending agency, central bank general manager Hector Neyrasaid.     He told reporters the government decided to stop payingthe World Bank because scheduled repayments outweighed theloans it was due to receive.     The measure was the latest hard-line debt stance adoptedby the government of President Alan Garcia, one of LatinAmerica's most delinquent debtors. The 22-month-oldadministration has cut repayments to 10 pct of export earningson nearly all its 14.4 billion dlr foreign debt.     Neyra said since late 1986 Peru had sought an accomodationwith the World Bank under which it would receive more creditsthan it would remit in repayments.     Neyra stressed Peru was not withdrawing from the worldbank. The country had recently increased its capitalsuscription in the institution by about three mln dollars.    The Bank would immediately resume loan disbursements toPeru once it cleared its arrears, he said. He did not specifythe value of the overdue payments. The economy ministry saidPeru's debt to the world bank was 521 mln dlrs at end-1985.    At the end of last year, Peru's total foreign debt stood at14.46 billion dollars, 13.17 billion dollars of which ismedium- and-long-term debt, the central bank said. Totalarrears were 5.42 billion dollars.    Central bank president Leonel Figueroa said Peru had enoughhard currency, gold and silver on hand to cover 10 or 11months' worth of imports.    The holdings of the two precious metals and the hardcurrencies were valued at 2.172 billion dlrs on May 22, 1987,he said.    Gross reserves were slightly lower at 1.857 billion dlrsbecause this classification did not include silver holdings andundervalued the central bank's gold.    Reserves were projected to fall at most 150 mln dlrs thisyear, he said. Reuter&#3;

In a recent interview with the French communist partynewspaper l'humanite, Cuban president Fidel Castro said thatcrude sugar production during the harvest would be "less than7.5 mln tonnes.    The harvest was plagued by a four year shortfall of rainwhich reduced the sugar content of the cane and by unseasonablerain storms during the first two months of this year which madecane cutting by mechanical combines virtually impossible.

reut2-018.sgm, EC FARM CRISIS LIKELY TO GO TO END-JUNE SUMMIT, Plans for key reforms of the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) controversial farm policy will almostcertainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of governmentat a summit meeting on June 29 and 30, Belgian finance ministerMark Eyskens said today.    Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing ajoint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which wasdesigned to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farmprice package which has endured since March.    Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president JacquesDelors as saying at the same meeting that it would be adisaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks hadto be referred to heads of government.    These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine andvegetable fats and oils, and proposals to change the system bywhich EC farm prices, expressed in European currency units(Ecus), are translated into the currencies of member states.    The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countrieswhich fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S., Amajor exporter of soybeans to the EC.    West Germany, meanwhile, is strongly against the technicalcurrency move, which would result in additional price cuts forfarmers in countries with strong currencies, such as the mark.    Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the twoissues are not referred to the summit because this would meanheads of government diverting their attention from much moreimportant world and Community issues.    Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were alsolikely to be less sound since they do not usually interestthemselves in such technically complex questions.    However, Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up somenuances in member state positions "which may make the dialoguemore constructive in the next few weeks."    If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month,the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pctcut in cereals prices, farm trade sources said. It originallyproposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus thisyear, with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops.    Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree aprice package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but fortheir disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currencyreforms.    The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the needfor budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain ECbudget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year.    Although Delors was said by aides to have found today'smeeting very useful, diplomats said there was little sign of amajor shift in the position of member states, or of financeministers adopting a different line from that of theiragriculture colleagues.    The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of thisweek in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge theirdifferences. REUTER&#3;

Presidents Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and Denis Sassou-Nguesso of Congo urged Africa's development partners to actover the continent's debt, which now totals 175 billion dlrs,at a meeting organised by the Economic Commission for Africa(ECA).    Their view was backed by Monique Landry, Canada's Ministerfor External Relations. "Whether we look at aid or debt ortrade, the rich countries have not as yet lived up to theirpart of last year's economic recovery pact."    Babangida said it was unrealistic to expect any country tospend more than 30 pct of its earnings on debt servicingparticularly as prices for the continent's commodities were sounstable.    Sassou Nguesso, current Chairman of the Organisation ofAfrican Unity, accused international aid donors of failing toprovide the vigorous effort they promised a year ago.    The conference, attended by African ministers, economistsand representatives from major donors, will review progresssince both sides agreed at the U.N.

reut2-018.sgm, POOR RAINFALL MAY HIT IVORY COAST COCOA - TRADE, Lack of rainfall in recent weeks mayhave affected Ivory Coast 1987/88 main crop cocoa prospects,although good precipitation in the last half of June and inJuly could still reverse the situation, trade sources said.    They said the crop is still likely to be fairly large andit is too early to determine the consequences of the dry spellon the harvest.    "This year's crop will probably be another good one. It isimpossible to tell how flowering is going, but there should beno problems unless something drastic happens," one trader said.    Private forecaster Accu-Weather reported today that mostIvory Coast cocoa growing regions were without rain over theweekend and similar weather will persist today and Tuesday.    "Rain would be welcomed, as the past week has been quitedry, except along the western portion of the coast," it said.    Traders agreed rain was needed, but some noted that the dryconditions had not affected the entire country.    The Ivorian Meteorological Office could not be reached forcomment or recent statistics. The trade sources said rainfallin recent weeks was likely insufficient for cocoa plants,although it is difficult to assess what the minimumrequirements are.    Trade sources said there had been good rains in lateJanuary, February and March which helped to promote flowering,but April and May were fairly dry in most areas except in thesouth west of the country.    The Ivory Coast mid-crop should have been covered byMarch/April rains but the main crop, still in its formationperiod, depends largely on rainfall from April through July.    The main rains normally last between May and July, beforereturning again in September/October. "Flowering has been lessthan normal and if the trees are not carrying that much at themoment, then they have a chance to recover," one trader said.    Another trade source noted the flowers still had plenty oftime to develop and the rains were "not good but still not bad."    The sources said that while the weather might emerge as acause for concern, crop conditions in West Africa werepresently taking a back seat to other factors in theinternational cocoa market.    This is not only because of the premature nature of anyharvest predictions but also because of the supply of cocoaalready burdening the market, they said.    "With a third year of surplus overhanging the market and thebuffer stock failing to boost prices despite regular purchases,the weather has not been a factor," one private consultant said.    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus said in its April cocoamarket report the current 1986/87 Ivory Coast crop was likelyto total 570,000 tonnes, which compares with a record 1985/86crop estimate of 585,000 tonnes.

Denman, in an Op-Ed piece in today's Washington Post, saidtrade disputes should be dealt with through negotiations,either bilaterally or multilaterally, through the Geneva-basedUnited Nations agency, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,GATT.    Denman's comments came as the Senate was to begin debatethis week on a major trade bill.    "It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partnersrunning a surplus with the United States should be beaten overthe head if trade barriers objected to by the United States arenot removed within a certain time-scale," said Denman in anapparent reference to some of the measures in the congressionaltrade bill.    "If we turn to the path of unilateral action, retaliationand counter-retaliation, the one-world (GATT) trading systemwill very quickly unravel," he said.    Denman said the 170 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit was notpurely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations.    "The trade deficit results from a combination ofmacroeconomic factors (the U.S. budget deficit), the exchangerate and the competitiveness of (U.S.) domestic industry,"Denman said.    He also said that Washington employed what he termed unfairtrade prctices.    He said the European Community had recently updated a listof some 30 U.S. trade barriers that impede EC exports.

reut2-018.sgm, GERMANY PLANS TO RUSH SPECIAL CREDITS TO FARMERS, Bonn is expected to rush throughlegislation this month creating special credits to protect WestGerman farmers from a proposed European Community, EC, paymentsfreeze, government sources said.    The new measures are apparently designed to shield WestGerman farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budgetcrisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the ECexecutive commission's farm policy reform plans, politicalsources said.    EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented jointsession in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate overfuture farm financing.    West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commissionattempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxingimports of vegetable oil and fats, for fear of U.S.retaliation.    Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetarymechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports.    The draft legislation, which the ruling centre-rightcoalition will present to parliament tomorrow, would providetemporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels.    The Commission, facing a five billion European CurrencyUnits (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of theyear, has threatened to start phasing out payment of somesubsidies and premiums from August, unless EC member statestake urgent measures to provide fresh funds.    West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the newlegislation top priority after last month's failure to agree toa farm price package for 1986/87.    Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take thesting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidiesby creating a buffer for West German farmers.    The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill andallow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1, ahead ofthe summer recess, SPD sources said.    SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his partywould support the bill, even though it would further swellmassive government spending on agriculture. He said the billwas an admission that the government believes the farm pricetalks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy.    According to a copy of the draft bill obtained by Reuters,government authorities will have over two billion marks (1.1billion dlrs) available to pay farmers advance subsidies andpremiums for grains and other crops harvested this summer.    The Commission has agreed to pay the subsidies eventually.But paying farmers on time will cost Bonn about 100 mln marks(55 mln dlrs) in interest payments, farm policy sources said.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet is expected to support thebill when it meets tomorrow. Reuter&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, BAKER SAYS DOLLAR DROP WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, Treasury Secretary JamesBaker said any further decline in the dollar against othercurrencies would be counterproductive.    Baker was asked after a speech to the Pan American EconomicLeadership Conference about U.S. policy in light of PresidentReagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he couldsee some further decline in the dollar within reason.    "All of the G-7 nations believe that any further decline inthe dollar would be counterproductive," Baker told reporters.    Following the Venice press conference by Reagan, the WhiteHouse clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying thatthe United States wants a stable dollar.    The main incentive for the United States to favor a weakerdollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit,but the deficit has narrowed for the past two months andappears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollaragainst the yen and the mark during the past two years.

reut2-018.sgm, GERMAN STEEL INDUSTRY TO SEEK LAY-OFF FUNDS, The West German Government will be askedJune 16 to provide nearly 850 million marks (470 milliondollars) to lay off or retrain 20,000 steel workers whose jobsare threatened by the recent slump in the country's steelindustry.    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor HelmutKohl will review a joint proposal by steel employers and tradeunions at a meeting on the ailing industry tomorrow.    Both steel employers and union leaders are expected to tellKohl tomorrow that the Government has failed to do enough toprotect German steel firms from subsidies and unfaircompetition from other European Community members.    Government sources said Bonn was prepared to take part in acommon effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. Butsince the Government is struggling to finance tax cuts byslashing state subsidies, it is not prepared to pick up thewhole bill for the layoffs, the sources said.    A spokesman for IG Metall, the metalworkers' trade union,said the proposal seeks redundancy payments to 10,000 workersin Ruhr and Rhineland plants. Some 6,000 workers would beredeployed in non-steel making sectors of steel companies,while a further 4,000 would be eligible for job-retrainingschemes.    The union estimates that the redundancy payments wouldtotal 600 million marks (340 million dollars), while jobretraining schemes would cost a further 240 million marks (130million dollars).    Up to 30,000 West German steel jobs are at risk in the nextfew years following steep losses incurred by the industry sincemid-1986.    Extensive restructuring of the industry in recent years wasunable to compensate for the effects of the weak dollar whichdepressed foreign demand for steel, industry sources said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, NO YIELD DAMAGE YET IN U.S. CORN, BEANS - USDA, The U.S. corn and soybean crops arein mostly good condition and have not suffered any yielddeterioration from recent hot, dry weather, AgricultureDepartment and private weather and crop analysts said.    "I don't see any reduction in yield potential yet," NortonStrommen, chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters. "The (cornand soybean) crop is actually in mostly good condition and isprogressing ahead of normal, which is good," he said.    Abnormally hot, dry weather in midwestern crop areassparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today, causing newcrop soybeans to advance the 30 cent daily limit to 6.14 dlrsper bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 2.81 dlrs.    "This rally is amazing," a private crop analyst said. "Corn,soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition."    The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm,dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed updevelopment of the crop, which will help the crop better copewith stress later in its more critical growing period.    "What this weather will do is simply push the crop towardsrapid development of a good, deep root system to draw on thesubsoil reserve. It actually strengthens the crop to go througha little stress early on," Strommen said.    Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape inmost growing areas.    Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn andsoybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until Julyand August.    But because of its early development this year, Strommensaid the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproductionperiod by the first of July.    "Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn orsoybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But thedryness still has to last for another two to three weeks," ananalyst said.    Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several moreweeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, cropanalysts agreed.    August and September are the critical yield-producingmonths for soybeans, Strommen said.    "The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply surviveduring May, June and July until the August rains whichdetermine the crop," a crop analyst said.    Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growingareas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensurethat there will not be problems later.    Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weatherforecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normalprecipitation in much of the corn belt.    "This opens up all sorts of speculation," he said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, HOT WEATHER PUSHES CBT GRAINS TO NEW HIGHS, Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, withmore forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs todayon the Chicago Board of Trade.    Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts fordelivery after this year's fall harvest. All months setlife-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs abushel.    "The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter thannormal for some time out," said David Bartholomew, assistantvice president for Merrill Lynch. "We have probably gone ashigh as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how tomeasure the euphoria level."    Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week,posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limitin new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.    Corn futures set contract highs in March through September,with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improvedharvest conditions in the southern Midwest.    The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybeanplants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefityoung plants by encouraging the development of deep rootsystems, Bartholomew said.    European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed toactive buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybeanorders went unfilled at the close, traders said.    After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have notsuffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.    Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of thedollar, which can depress prices by making grains moreexpensive for foreign buyers.    But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York'sCOMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settlesteady.    Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that theweather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears ofinflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures,which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S.trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.    A USDA report released after trading said the number ofcattle being fed in seven major producing states was abovelevels expected by traders. Traders said the report wouldprobably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the ChicagoMercantile Exchange.

reut2-018.sgm, THREE U.S. EXCHANGES VIE FOR GOLD, The glitter of gold has generated athree-way competition among the world's largest futuresexchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal.    When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introducesgold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will gotoe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity ExchangeInc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describeas the world's precious metals futures capital forinstitutional business.    And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the ChicagoBoard of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when theCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pendingapplication for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-sidewith the CBT's smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds)gold futures.    The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrumentin July 1986.    CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked theexchange to reintroduce the contract because of recentvolatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing thedecision may also have been clearing problems in May whichforced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days inan effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades,especially in silver futures.    Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity forother exchanges to successfully offer precious metalscontracts, industry sources say.    But it is much too early to predict whether other exchangescan inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volumeof more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments tobuy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs.    While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller goldcontract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions,was under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it hassurpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months.    "The climate could not be better for this venture by theCME," said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President NeilMcGarrity.    "Everybody is talking about metals now, and interestingdaily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears.There's good trading volume in all world outlets," McGarrityadded.    "The Merc's gold futures would be insurance for dealers,merchants and customers that there would be a market open fortrading," if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes theComex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vicepresident and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros.Inc. and a Comex board member.    Delivery points vary for each exchange's 100-ounce goldfutures. Comex contracts are deliverable through New Yorkwarehouses while the CME contract specifies London deliverythrough a CME account at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd., a memberof the London gold market. The CBT gold application specifiesdelivery from New York and Chicago vaults.    The Comex and the CBT have applied to the CFTC for anearlier precious metals opening to match the CME's startingtime of 7:20 a.m. CDT. The exchanges said the earlier startallows for trading before many important government reports arereleased at 7:30 a.m. CDT.    CME marketing sources said arbitrage possibilities existwith side-by-side trading, noting local interests can begenerated by traders dealing in foreign currency and short-termdebt futures along with gold futures contracts to further hedgetheir financial risks.    "If the dollar rises, traders can sell currencies and buygold," said David Johnson, CME's manager of currency products.    The Chicago Board of Trade sees an extra advantage to goldtrading. "Given our night trading session, we could add eitherour pending 100-ounce gold or our existing 5,000-ounce silvercontract to attract overseas business," a CBT official said.    Which market is identified as the precious metal capitaldoes not appear to be a major issue among professionals.    "We've seen Chicago bring in a new constituency before, withperhaps different needs," Mocatta Metals Chairman Dr. HenryJarecki said.    "Merchants will go to the CME or anywhere to trade a liquidcontract. Our firm is no exception," Jarecki said.    "At worst, even if the CME gold futures fail, the Comex willbe under pressure to improve the integrity of its clearingprocesses," a CME official added. Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, EC CONSIDERS NEW PROPOSALS TO END FARM DEADLOCK, The European Community (EC) executiveCommission will today urgently consider whether to take a newinitiative to break the current deadlock over reform of thebloc's farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis.    The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following whatdiplomats described as a largely fruitless special jointmeeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue inLuxembourg Monday.    Commission officials said farm commissioner FransAndriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to presentfarm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they werefirst announced in March.    The most controversial aspects of these proposals are aplan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to financerapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measureswhich would change the way common EC farm prices are convertedinto member state currencies.    West German delegation sources, who have opposed both plansfiercely, said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats taxplan and modified the currency proposals, there would be achance of agreement on other aspects of the package.      These include measures to cut the effective price paid tofarmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct.      But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals wouldinclude plans for revising the current oils and fats andcurrency regulations.     The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock inmeetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issuescould then be referred to the EC heads of government summit atthe end of the month.    Commission president Jacques Delors, who wants to ensurethe summit has ample time to consider proposals for new meansof financing the cash-strapped EC, said yesterday it would be"disastrous" if farm issues had to be discussed by governmentleaders.    However, with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75billion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year,the Commission will be wary of making major concessions to thetraditionally free-spending farm ministers, diplomats said    Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens, who chairedyesterday's joint meeting of ministers, said afterwards someaspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have tobe referred to the summit.    Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting asuseful in clarifying the issues, some diplomats said it seemedto have merely confirmed member states' long held positions.    Indeed, they said an extra state, Spain, seemed to havelined up with the four others already opposing the oils andfats tax, West Germany, Britain, Denmark and Portugal. Reuter&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, STUDY SAYS U.S. EMPLOYMENT NOT JEOPARDIZED BY BORDER PLANTS, The growing shift of low-skilledmanufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexican bordercities is not a threat to American employment because it willhelp create new markets for products, according to a studyreleased today.    Richard Bolin, director of the Flagstaff Institute ofArizona, which studies international trade issues, said theUnited States needs to encourage the expansion of manufacturingin developing countries so that those nations can becomeconsumers of more U.S. goods.    His study was commissioned by the border city of McAllen,Texas, for presentation to the International Trade Commissionwhich is gathering information for a report to Congress on whatchanges may be needed in the U.S. tariff codes to prevent theloss of jobs and industry.    McAllen and other Texas border cities have benefitted froma trend among U.S. companies to build twin plants that employfactory workers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.    More than 700 manufacturers are taking advantage of lenienttax codes that allow U.S. companies to bring raw goods intoMexico for assembly by low-skilled workers into products thatare completed by U.S. workers at a nearby sister plant.    Bolin said his research indicated that the shift inlow-paying jobs across the border reflected changingdemographics of the U.S. workforce.    "In the post-baby boom era, fewer workers will be availableto fill these low-skill jobs -- and these workers will bebetter educated than prior generations," Bolin told reporters inMcAllen.    "The jobs in low-tech industries that are being exported toother countries are, for the most part, jobs that we may not beable to fill in the future."    U.S. employment in less-skilled manufacturing jobs plungedby more than 900,000 between 1977 and 1982, largely due to thetransfer of jobs outside U.S. borders, he said. Americanemployment in high-tech industries increased by 634,000 duringthe same period, he said.    But high-tech industries, those in which engineers make upmore than six percent of the workforce, pay higher wages andgenerate more U.S. exports than low-tech businesses, he said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS DOLLAR SHOULD BE ABOVE 170 YEN, The dollar should worth more than 170 yenbased on purchasing power parity, the Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry (MITI) said in its annual white paper oninternational trade.    Using 1973 as a base year, the ministry said inflationdifferentials pointed to a yen/dollar rate of 172 in fourthquarter 1986. The dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen.    MITI also said the so-called "J-curve" and the drop in oilprices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6billion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year.    On a customs cleared basis, the Japanese trade surplus roseto a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year.    The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5billion dlrs and the "J-curve" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise inthe 1986 surplus.    Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance inrecent years, MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could beaccounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences ineconomic growth rates between Japan and other countries, and 36pct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports.    Analyzing the expansion in the U.S. Trade deficit from 1982to 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchangerates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity ofimports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economicgrowth rates. The figures do not tally to 100 pct because otherminor factors have been left out.    "One index of trade structure, the income elasticity ofexports and imports, shows that the U.S. Is more likely toexperience increases in imports, while Japan is structurallypredisposed to growth in exports," MITI said.    Structural adjustment is already underway in Japan, underthe impact of the strong yen, MITI said. Japanese companies arestepping up their imports and expanding capacity overseas.    Japanese consumer attitudes are also changing. The ministrycited a survey showing that price was now the number one factorin the purchase of imports from the U.S. And Western Europe,replacing design and brand reputations.    "The smooth adjustment of the economic structure calls formeasures to address the needs of affected firms," it said. "Wholeindustries have felt the pinch and employment is expected tosuffer."    "Sustained economic growth, led by domestic demand, willalso be an essential condition," the ministry said.    It said four structural factors have contributed to thegrowth of the U.S. Trade deficit in recent years -- a declinein U.S. Industrial competitiveness, insufficient productivecapacity, an increase in foreign procurement by U.S. Companiesand short-sighted U.S. Management attitudes.    "While (U.S.) exports have picked up somewhat with thedollar's fall in value, no marked improvements have appeared inthe import picture," MITI said. REUTER&#3;

In a statement released after Statistics Bureau figuresshowed the May deficit was below forecasts at 866 mln dlrs,Keating said the cumulative deficit is now likely to be about1.5 billion dlrs below the Treasury forecast of 14.75 billionissued with the 1986/87 Budget papers last August.    However, the government had subsequently revised theforecast to around 13.75 billion dlrs after a series of currentaccount figures indicated a declining trend.    Keating's revised 1986/87 current account deficit forecastcompares with a record shortfall of 14.40 billion dlrs in1985/86, a level nearly double the 7.29 billion deficitrecorded only two years earlier in 1983/84.    Keating said the main reason for his revision was abetter-than-expected export performance. Recent quarterlyfigures showed export volumes rose 14.4 pct in the half-year toMarch 30 while import volumes rose only 0.9 pct, he said.    The Bureau data issued today showed the cumulative deficitfor the first 11 months of 1986/87 narrowed to 12.32 billiondlrs from 13.21 billion a year earlier. REUTER&#3;

He said a rise in world prices had made the Uruguayansreluctant to ship any soybeans at the agreed price of 226.56U.S. Dlrs per tonne.    The Uruguayans agreed to supply part of the shipment afterthe Taiwan committee threatened last week to cancel the order,but they postponed delivery to July 1-20 from the original June5-25, the committee spokesman said.    Government sources in Montevideo confirmed that Uruguayangrain exporting firms would ask Taiwan to reconsider prices onthe soybeans but said the government would not intervene in thedispute.    "The deal was agreed to between two private companies,without any participation whatsoever from the Uruguayangovernment," Uruguyan Agriculture Ministry spokesman AndresBonino said.    He added, "Uruguay is not going to export 70,000 tonnes ofsoybeans, since total production this year has been lower thanthat figure."    The contract called for the Uruguayans to deliver the70,000 tonnes in two shipments between June 5 and August 10.    Taiwan's ambassador in Montevideo, Henry Wang, toldreporters, "Both countries are finishing details to arrive at asatisfactory price."    He said the price would be "very advantageous (for Uruguay)because it will be above the international price."

The official, who met reporters but asked not to beidentified, made clear that the use of a series of economicmeasurements to monitor the seven leading industrialdemocracies would be difficult but was a major step incooperation.    The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,Italy and Canada agreed at the summit to use a series ofeconomic indicators to forecast economic behaviour in anattempt to increase cooperation on economic policy.    The setting of a formal process of review, while seen as astep forward in the cooperative effort, was also criticisedbecause it lacked teeth to force a country to change economicbehaviour that hurt other countries.    But the official said influences and peer pressure couldhave a major impact in reforming an erring country.    Economists generally believe a cooperative economicapproach by the largest countries will have a salutory impacton the global economy, including helping the poorest debtorcountries.    The official said the IMF function would be to warncountries when their economic behaviour was straying badly andtry to persuade them to modify it. "I hope it will be a yellowlight, not a red flag," he said.    He also said he hoped negotiations would begin in the nextfew weeks to increase the IMF's structural adjustment facility,which helps 62 of the world's poorest countries.    The facility, approved about 15 months ago, is currentlyfinanced at about 3.8 billion dlrs, but this would be tripledunder the plan.    He said reaching an accord on the agreement would be verydifficult, with countries pressing each other to do more andfinding reasons to reduce their own exposure. "They will betremendously difficult negotiations," he said. REUTER&#3;

"Even if African countries want to pay their debts they willnot be able to," Congolese president Sassou-Nguesso told a newsconference at a meeting between foreign and African experts onthe continent's economic prospects.

"In these conditions can African countries continue torespect their debt servicing?" Sassou-Nguesso asked.    He said the debt issue would be the main subject at nextmonth's OAU summit in Addis Ababa and would not rule out thepossibility of a joint "debtors' revolt" there.

reut2-018.sgm, OPEC OFFICIAL SAYS CARTEL HAS REGAINED LEADERSHIP, OPEC has regained its former role asprice-setter in the oil market following last year's price war,acting OPEC Secretary General Fadhil al-Chalabi said.    But he said he expects no short-term rise in demand forOPEC oil, adding that market stability will mean a continuedsacrifice for the 13 OPEC member countries.    Al-Chalabi, speaking at a university here yesterday, saidthe December 1986 conference at which OPEC set an 18 dlr perbarrel reference price gave the market a signal that theproducers' group was serious.    "It (OPEC) has no choice but to defend the price and thishas restored its credibility," said al-Chalabi, who is inCaracas for a meeting of the OPEC Fund Board of Governors.    Al-Chalabi said OPEC members have not exceeded theproduction quotas which took effect on February 1 and spotmarket prices are now near or above official OPEC prices.    Before the December conference OPEC faced a major and basicdilemma which led to the loss of its leadership role, he said."The question was, what should OPEC do? Defend the price andrisk losing its market share? Or defend its market share andlet the price drop?" he asked.    "OPEC has chosen to stabilise the price. But the question ishow long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?" he said.    Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC's success in shoring upprices and achieving discipline regarding quotas, he saw noquick end to restraint in production.    He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oilbecause increased non-OPEC production, combined withconservation and the use of alternative energy sources, hascaused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed.

Among stocks posting earlygains at mid morning was Fiat ordinary, which was indicated13,090 lire against yesterday's closing of 12,705. These areprovisional, not closing prices.    Analysts said the results from Sunday's and Monday's votingshould boost the bourse in the short-term, but the market'smedium-term prospects remain clouded because of doubt over howlong it will take to form a new government.

reut2-018.sgm, JAPAN OFFICIALS SAY WORST MAY BE OVER FOR ECONOMY, Government officials said the worst may beover for the Japanese economy, after today's news of strongerthan expected growth in the January/March period.    But private economists were not so sure and said theeconomy was unlikely to achieve the government's 3.5 pct growthforecast in the current fiscal year ending next March.    As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/Marchquarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous threemonths. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNPgrowth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86.    The government economists acknowledged that the improvedexport performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely tobe repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up twopct from the previous three months.    The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/Junequarter, they said.    However, given the yen's recent stability, stepped-updomestic demand should work as a driving force to push theeconomy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said.    Many private economists, though, doubt that the economywill achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast for the1987/88 year.    Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government'sforecast, which was revised downwards to three pct lastDecember from an original four pct.    Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except forhousing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at MitsubishiResearch Institute.    Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth innominal income stays low, he added.     The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarterwas simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in thepreceding three months, Takahashi said.    Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong butthis was primarily because utility companies brought forwardtheir 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarterof 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulationpackage announced last fall, he said.    Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said hewas unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added heexpects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months.    Destocking is coming to an end and companies are startingto rebuild inventories, Furuta said.    Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lowerinterest rates as well as government policies to stimulate thesector, he said. The government's recently unveiled 6,000billion yen economic package will also help the economy.    But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve thegovernment's 3.5 pct forecast for 1987/88, although growthmight come close to three pct. REUTER&#3;

Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor HelmutKohl reviewed a joint proposal by steel employers and tradeunions at a special meeting with steel industryrepresentatives.    Companies like Fried Krupp &lt;KRPG.D> and Hoesch Werke AG&lt;HWKG.F>, which saw profits plunge last year, have taken theunusual step of aligning with the metalworkers' trade union, IGMetall, to press for government finance to slim staff levelsstill further.    Government officials said Bonn was prepared to take part ina common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. Butsince the government was struggling to finance tax cuts byreducing state subsidies, it could not pay for all the layoffs.    A spokesman for IG Metall said the joint proposal foresawredundancy payments to 10,000 workers in Ruhr and Rhinelandplants. Some 6,000 workers would be redeployed in non-steelmaking sectors of steel companies, while a further 4,000 wouldbe eligible for job-retraining schemes.

reut2-018.sgm, ZINC CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTFALL SEEN IN 1988, Next year is likely to see a shortfallin zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although thereshould be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltdmetals analyst Stephen Briggs said.    Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metalsconference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 wasthe imminent cessation of new mining and termination of millingat Pine Point in Canada.    However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles.    Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there wasunlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one ofrecord production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipatedin Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacityin South Korea.    "Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are alsoexpected in 1987," Briggs said.    This would partly be due to a return to more normal levelsat existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied withachievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faroin Canada.    Looking further forward, the major event was the probableopening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacityof 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.    "Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that therewill be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s," headded.    The picture for lead was also closely allied to that ofzinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and thereforesupply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products fromzinc mines.    "On this basis, our calculations point to a modestoversupply of lead concentrates in 1987," Briggs said.    The copper forecast, however, was for a recordnon-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.    Production of primary refined copper metal would alsoincrease, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading toa moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnesthis year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of thedecade, he said.

He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticismof Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods.    But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral tradetalks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food.    Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extremeexample of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S.Growers to the Japanese market. This is closed to importsexcept in emergency.    Kato said Japanese farmers should however "shed some blood,"to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade.    His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the RicePrice Council at which the government advisory body willdiscuss the 1987 crop producer rice price.    Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recentsummit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies inVenice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) in May.    Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term needto cut subsidies worldwide, Kato said.    Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protectproducers. He said the United States spends some 25.8 billiondlrs a year to support producer prices and on its exportenhancement program and the EC 21.7 billion, while Japan spendsonly 2.9 billion. He said that although Japan provides theworld's highest level of subsidies per acre, its subsidy perfarm family was several times lower than in the United States.

reut2-018.sgm, TAIWAN PARLIAMENT BACKS FREE CAPITAL OUTFLOWS, Parliament approved a proposal to dropall controls on capital outflows, raising the prospect thatTaiwan's vast resevoir of foreign exchange will flow into theworld economy.    A government spokesman said the new law would bepromulgated by President Chiang Ching-Kuo within 10 days andfinancial authorities would then be empowered to lift controlson currency outflows at any time.    Tight restrictions on capital inflows introduced this yearwill remain in place, the spokesman said.    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-Cheng has said the controlswill be lifted at the end of next month or early in August.    The central bank and finance ministry proposed liftingcurrency restrictions to help reduce Taiwan's foreign exchangereserves, which stand at about 60 billion U.S. Dlrs and haveled to runaway growth in money supply.    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan andWest Germany, also draw attention to Taiwan's huge tradesurplus and the government fears they are making the island atarget for U.S. Trade protectionism.    The surplus rose 34 pct to a record 7.32 billion U.S. Dlrsin the first five months of this year and about 90 pct of itwas with the United States.    Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.9 pct in theyear to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.    Local bankers and economists say when the controls arelifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency andinvest it freely overseas. But they warn against expectationsof a sudden outflow of capital.    "I don't think we're going to see a big bang," John Brinsden,the Taiwan manager of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters in arecent interview.    Bankers said that businessmen have been holding vastquantities of foreign exchange overseas for many years and alsohave been freely buying and exporting currency through aflourishing black-market.    "Obviously there will be an outflow of funds ... But I don'tthink it's going to be much," said Danny Chan, director ofFidelity Securities Investment Consulting Corp.    Economists say the success of plans to encourage capitaloutflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise ofthe local currency.    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 23 pct against theU.S. Dollar since September 1983, prompting an inflow ofspeculative money. It rose by one Taiwan cent today to close at31.08.    The government spokesman said the new law does not empowerauthorities to permanently lift capital controls, but anyproposal to reimpose them would need the approval ofparliament.    Many economists believe that once the controls are liftedit will be almost impossible to reimpose them. REUTER&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, MAJOR EUROPEAN ZINC SMELTER MERGER SEEN BY 1990, There should be at least one mergerbetween major European zinc smelters before the end of thedecade, Christian Bue, Executive Vice President (commercial) ofSMM Penarroya in France, said.    Speaking on the second day of the Metal Bulletin basemetals conference, Bue said he expected the current talksbetween five smelters including Penarroya to result inintegration between at least some of the companies before 1990.    The five companies, SMM Penarroya, Outokumpu Oy, PreussagAg, Ste de la Vieille Montagne and Boliden Ore and Metals AB,have 22 pct of the world market, Bue added.    "We have no alternative than to integrate out businessesinto large trading blocs if we are to survive the cut-throatprice competition and the trend to forward integration from themining companies," Bue said.    "It is by no means certain that all the five companiesinvolved in the talks will integrate together. It is quitelikely, and even preferable, that the European smelters formtwo or three large integrated blocs.    "In this way we will be better able to negotiate with ourconcentrate suppliers on one side, and with the metal buyers onthe other," Bue added.    In the past, production overcapacity and the intensecompetition between the European zinc smelters has meant theyhave not only been in a very weak negotiating position whenbuying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling themetal, Bue noted.    Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shutdown excess capacity, the burden of this on individualcompanies is far too heavy and no one can be expected tovolunteer, he added.    Another possible but very risky solution is to investheavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said.    "My answer to this suggestion is that individual companieswho do not invest will surely die, and those that do investmight survive, but only might, " Bue said.    "The only real option in my mind is integration,rationalization and stabilization. We have no alternative, " headded.    Bue also said that the European smelters were completelydissatisfied with the tradition of pricing concentrates andmetals in US dollars, and suggested moving either to a basketof the world's major currencies or pricing in European currencyunits (Ecus) to protect against exchange rate volatility.    Bue's views on integration between European smelters weremet by general approval from the conference audience comprisingrepresentatives from many of the world's major mining, smeltingand trading companies, although some of the miningrepresentatives were somewhat sceptical in view of their ownindustry's move towards integration with smelters.    However, some concentrate traders did express worry abouttheir own position if the metals industry does make the move tolarge trading blocs.    The currency basket suggestion cropped up constantly, butfew said they thought matters would change in the near future. REUTER&#3;

In addition, the Commission proposes that the level of thetax, expected to start at 330 Ecus per tonne, could be reviewedevery three months rather than annually.    Diplomatic sources said the change to the proposals forfish oils appears to be an attempt to overcome objections tothe tax from Portugal and Spain, major fishing nations.    Other countries opposing the tax include Britain, WestGermany and Denmark.    The new proposals retain most of the Commission's originalplans in other sectors.    However, they mark the Commission's recognition that itcannot get proposals to reduce the period of intervention forcereals, diplomats said.    Instead the Commission proposes to cut the monthlyincrements applied to cereals during the November to May periodwhen intervention is open to 2.7 Ecus a tonne for durum wheatand two Ecus a tonne for other cereals.    The document shows the Commission has also changed itsgreen currency proposals in the light of heavy opposition,notably from West Germany.    West German and Dutch positive monetary compensatoryamounts (MCAs) would be immediately cut by 0.5 points, with afurther one point cut at the beginning of the 1988/89 season.

In his mini-budget on May 13 Keating said the budgetdeficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two andthree billion dlrs.    Howard has said a conservative government under hisleadership would reduce the 55 pct top personal and company taxlevel to 38 pct and fund the reduction by cutting governmentspending.    Keating and Prime Minister Bob Hawke have promised not toincrease taxes or impose new ones, but rejected any tax cuts.Instead they called for wage and other economic restraints tohelp overcome balance of payments and foreign debt problems.    Inflation declined to 9.4 pct for the year to March 31 froman annual 9.8 pct at the end of the December quarter.    Hawke has said inflation would fall to six pct by themiddle of next year.

"It is not arithmetically possible for every country in theworld to be a net exporter at the same time. The U.S. Deficit,which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into whicheveryone's export-led strategy for growth has gone."    "The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed onthis deficit, so something will have to give and it will bepossibly a traumatic experience," he added.

The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier.

Total expenditure is seen at 22.907 billion dlrs against20.94 billion in the year to end-March 1987. Total revenue isseen at 23.29 billion dlrs against 18.992 billion.

Since the deal was completed, the market value of the stakein Hunter had almost doubled and at the same time enabled thegroup to concentrate efforts in its food division oningredients -- mainly sugar, gelatine and flavours.

reut2-018.sgm, JAPAN FINISHING UP WORK ON SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET, The Finance Ministry is putting thefinishing touches on a roughly 2,000 billion yen supplementarybudget for 1987/88 and has started to turn its attention tonext year's main budget, ministry officials said.    The supplementary budget is designed to help finance the6,000 billion yen emergency economic package the governmentunveiled last month to boost domestic demand.    Ministry officials said the government would issue about1,300 billion yen in construction bonds to help pay for theincreased public investment set out in the emergency package.    The rest of the supplementary budget will be financed by450 billion yen in proceeds from last year's sale of shares inNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) and by higher thanexpected 1986/87 tax revenues, officials said.    One official said the carry-over of tax revenues into the1987/88 fiscal year that began on April 1 might be more than1,000 billion yen. Soaring land and share prices have boostedreceipts, especially from securities and land taxes.    With less than half of the carry-over likely to be used inthe current supplementary budget, the rest will be availablefor a second supplementary budget expected later this year.    The second supplementary budget will be used to finance thegovernment's wage bill, which will not be known until afterwage talks later this year, one official said.    The government must also finance the tax cut of more than1,000 billion yen which it promised in its emergency packagebut which will not be contained in the first supplementarybudget, due to be presented to parliament next month.    The Finance Ministry's budget bureau is hoping the taxcarry-over and higher than expected revenues again this yearwill be enough to finance the second supplementary budget, hesaid.    Officials said the Finance Ministry does not want to issuedeficit-financing bonds or use the extra proceeds from thisyear's NTT share sale to fund the second supplementary budget.    Besides the first supplementary budget, the government alsointends to introduce a new tax reform bill to parliament duringthe upcoming extraordinary session, officials said.    The government was forced to abandon its first tax reformbill due to strong opposition to its plan to introduce a fivepct sales tax.    The sales tax was designed to help finance cuts inindividual and corporate income taxes.    The new bill will present the 1,000 billion yen-plus taxcut contained in the emergency package as the first step to anoverhaul of the country's tax system, officials said.    It will also contain a controversial plan to phase out taxbreaks on savings, although it may not take effect in Octoberas originally planned, they said.    Looking ahead to next year's main budget, the FinanceMinistry is beginning to debate whether to abandon itsso-called minus ceiling for public investment.    That policy calls on government departments to cut publicinvestment spending by five pct per year.    Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo said recently thepolicy would be suspended in 1988/89, pending a recommendationfrom the government's administrative reform council.    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said in April thatbudget request guidelines for invesment expenditures would bereviewed.    But some officials at the Finance Ministry's budget bureausaid they were hopeful the policy would be retained.    They fear that a suspension of the guidelines for publicinvestment could lead to increased pressure on the governmentto loosen its grip on current expenditures as well.    The account would also extend interest-free loans toprofitable public works projects developed in conjunction withthe private sector, the officials said.    In this way, the Finance Ministry could meet growingpressure on it to boost capital spending while maintaining atight grip on outlays by other government departments.    Surplus funds from this year's sale of NTT shares couldtotal about 3,000 billion yen. Based on the current marketprice, the planned sale of 1.95 mln shares would raise morethan 5,000 billion yen, compared to about 2,000 billion plannedfor in the main 1987/88 budget. REUTER&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, EC FARM MINISTERS END MEETING WITHOUT PRICE ACCORD, European Community farm ministersplunged the bloc into a crisis today by ending a marathonnegotiation on 1987/88 farm prices without agreement.    Their chairman, Belgian Paul de Keersmaeker, told a pressconference this morning ministers gave a majority vote infavour of all aspects of an EC Commission compromise proposalintroduced on Tuesday.    However, the minority against the crucial plan for a tax onvegetable and marine oils and fats was big enough to block itsadoption, and British Agriculture Minister John MacGregor saidother aspects of the proposals are likely to be vetoed.    MacGregor said the meeting foundered in part because of animplicit indication from the West Germans that they wereprepared to veto two other aspects of the package, the futuremonetary compensatory amounts system and proposals directlyconnected with common prices.    De Keersmaeker said he will now consider when ministersshould be called for further talks, but diplomats said theoutcome of the meeting makes it almost certain the majoroutstanding issues will be referred to EC heads of governmentwho hold a summit meeting on June 29 and 30 in Brussels.    A Commission official said the Commission will work outstopgap measures which it will bring in on July 1 if thedeadlock persists. These will concern products such as cereals,colza, sugar, beef and milk, for which there would otherwise beno legal EC regulations from that date.    Trade sources expect these will include a seven pct cut inguaranteed prices for most cereals.    The official said the measures "will take into account thesituation in the market, but also the EC's severe budgetarysituation."    The Commission was expecting an EC budget deficit this yearof almost six billion dlrs even before it presented itscompromise, which would have cost almost one billion more. Itestimates the oils and fats tax would bring in 2.3 billion dlrsin a full year.    Diplomats said Britain, West Germany and the Netherlandsmaintained their opposition to the tax despite Commissionattempts to persuade them it would not unfairly hit exportsfrom countries outside the EC.

The government would also outlaw the practice of doublededuction of losses by dual resident companies, known as "doubledipping," Douglas said in a budget statement.    The anti-tax-haven legislation would affect non-residententities, such as companies and trusts, set up in low taxcountries and earning mainly passive investment income, Douglassaid.    A consultative document will be released in Septemberexplaining the proposed legislation, and a consultativecommittee will then receive public submissions and advise thegovernment on implementation, Douglas said.    The legislation would attack tax avoidance but not genuinebusiness activity, he added.    He said some New Zealand residents were avoiding NewZealand tax entirely by setting up non-resident entities in taxhavens, which intercepted and gathered income taxable in NewZealand.    In a move to counter "double dipping," the government wouldno longer allow dual resident companies to group their losses,Douglas said.

The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is thefull amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceedsreceived to-date. The balance will be paid in October.    Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery tothe mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlledFiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.    However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of theforecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all caneharvested by November 30, he said.    Ganilau said, "This will be at least one month in advance ofthe expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. Thebalance of the second payment will be made six weeks after theend of crushing."    Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that anestimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.The FDB rejected this request.    Ganilau said, however, "The bank is prepared to carefullyconsider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases ofhardship on a case-by-case basis."    In response to a further demand that all soldiers beremoved from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the armywould restrict its presence in the cane areas.    He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits toharvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unionsto hold the necessary meetings in preparation for thecommencement of harvest.    Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers hadindicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,he added. REUTER&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, JAPAN INSTITUTIONS EYEING T-BOND INVESTMENT WARILY, Some major Japanese institutionalinvestors are gradually returning to investing in U.S.Treasuries, although fear that the dollar has not yet bottomedout has kept others cautiously waiting on the sidelines.    Trust banks and some investment trusts are starting to lookat buying treasuries for short-term gains, while otherinvestment trusts and most life insurers are still wary,according to fund managers polled by Reuters.    The five percentage point gap between U.S. And Japaneselong-term bonds is the major attraction of T-bonds.    Most institutions remain sensitive to the prospects ofdollar declines, after making huge foreign exchange losses ontheir foreign bond holdings last fiscal year ended March.    The seven leading local life insurers alone saw losses ontheir foreign bond holdings of over 1,700 billion yen, or some11.5 billion dlrs, in 1986/87, industry sources said.    However, most institutional investors want to buy U.S.T-bonds due to the absence of profitable domestic instruments.    "Despite all the negative factors, we have definite demandfor U.S. Securities," said Osamu Fukushima, deputy manager ofMitsui Trust and Banking Co Ltd's securities department.    Another trust bank fund manager said, "What matters the mostare the fundamentals of the U.S. Economy and thecompetitiveness of U.S. Industry. We are closely watching thegrowth of U.S. Exports, which is an important measure of thefundamental strength of the dollar." The U.S. Trade deficit'sdecline in April was due to a 1.2 billion dlr decline inimports, while exports did not show a recovery, he said.    One life insurance company fund manager said, "We doubt theU.S. Government will fight the trade and fiscal deficits,especially after the announcement of Federal Reserve Boardchairman Paul Volcker's resignation."    "The receptive stance of the U.S. Congress on the call forfurther dollar falls to cut the country's trade deficit alsomakes us wary about U.S. Bonds purchases," the life insurancecompany fund manager said.    Yuji Miyaji, deputy manager of the Sumitomo Trust andBanking Co Ltd's securities investment department, said, "We areslowly starting to buy U.S. Bonds because the gap of over 500basis points between the U.S. And Japan is very attractiveHowever, we are pessimistic on the dollar's further recovery.We find that U.S. Economic fundamentals have not changed sofar."    Keijirou Fukushima, manager at Yamaichi Investment TrustManagement Co Ltd's bond portfolio management department, said,"We would like to invest in U.S. Bonds gradually, given animproved inflation outlook and the limited chances of a furthersteep fall in the dollar from now."    "We have already reduced forward dollar selling volume to 40pct of our total foreign assets from 60 pct," he said.    Another life insurance company fund manager said, "We havestarted investing in U.S. Treasury securities, but only on atrading basis." REUTER&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, INVESTIGATORS SAY AIR LANKA LOSSES DEVASTATING, A commission set up to unravel theaffairs of debt-ridden Air Lanka says the airline amassedlosses of up to 265 mln U.S. Dlrs in "the most devastatingfinancial tragedy" in Sri Lankan commercial history.    The commission, which scrutinised financial dealings fromaircraft acquisitions to give-away cookbooks, blamed theairline's previous board for the losses. The panel, appointedin August by President Junius Jayewardene, submitted its reportto him on April 20. A copy was obtained by Reuters. The reportwill be made available to the public by next week.    The three-man commission recommended its findings be passedto state law officers to decide whether penal action wasnecessary against any members of the former board or AirLanka's management. The airline comes under the DefenceMinistry, a portfolio held by Jayewardene himself.    The commission said Air Lanka's reports to Jayewardene"blurred" its true financial health. It said the airline hadirretrievably lost its share capital of 3.8 billion rupees.    To finance deficits, it had also used up a treasury loan of800 mln rupees and part of foreign currency loans obtained foraircraft purchases and infrastructure needs, it said.    "Air Lanka is thus indebted to overseas lenders to the valueof one billion rupees without any productive assets orcollateral to provide for its repayment," the commission said.    It said the airline's losses were assessed at 5.59 billionrupees at March 31, 1986. But cumulative losses would reach 7.7billion, implying Air Lanka lost money at the rate of 1.3billion rupees a year between 1979, when it started, and 1986.    "These results must rank as the most devastating financialtragedy ever suffered in Sri Lanka's commercial history," thecommission said.    The report said the airline's dangerously criticalfinancial condition was due to uncontrolled spending --particularly the way in which the airline expanded its fleet --poor marketing, and extreme laxity in cost controls.    "It is clear to us that Air Lanka's misfortunes are largelyof its own creation and that the reponsibility must restprimarily with the board of directors," it said.    Air Lanka had blamed its problems on the effects on tourismof Sri Lanka's Tamil separatist rebellion, the depreciatingrupee and under-capitalisation. The commission dismissed theseas invalid.    The report said most of the major problems stemmed fromconcentration of power by Captain S.R. Wikramanayake who heldthe posts of both chairman and managing director.    "It is mainly he who has to be responsible for whatever thestatus of Air Lanka is in today," it said.    Wikramanayake resigned with the other board members lastNovember. He could not be contacted for comment.    The commission recommended that its findings should bepassed "to the law officers of the state ... To ascertain ifpenal action is necessary against any or all members of theformer board of Air Lanka or its management staff."    The panel recommended equity involvement of one or moreforeign airlines in Air Lanka and the granting of maximumconcessions to make the carrier attractive to foreign and localinvestment. It also suggested selling assets, such as twoBoeing 747s financed by U.S. Dollar loans, to reduce debt.    It said Air Lanka and the government should renegotiateU.S. Dollar-denominated debts into other currencies which formthe core of earnings and obtain lower interest rates. It alsoproposed negotiations for the return of two Lockheed TristarL1011-500s now leased to British Airways before the leasesexpire next March. REUTER&#3;

BankAmerica vice chairman Frank N. Newman held a meetinghere today to outline its fund-raising plan to some 20 Japanesebanks, he told Reuters.    He also stressed the company's efforts to streamlineoperations, by withdrawing from unprofitable energy-relatedareas to concentrate more on its Californian home base.    But Newman said the company had no intention of selling its Seafirst Corp Subsidiary in Washington.    A document obtained by Reuters shows the fund-raisingeffort involves 250 mln dlrs in 12-year subordinated capitalnotes and 100 mln in convertible preferred stock.    It has made a shelf registration with the SEC so that itcan issue debt securities whenever market conditions arefavorable.    The company already raised 100 mln dlrs in the U.S. Marketlast month, he added.    According to the document, the 250 mln dlrs in subordinatedcapital notes will carry an interest rate of 100 basis pointsover the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Theminimum rate will be six pct and the maxiumum 12 pct.    The notes will be redeemable at par after four years andwill also have warrants attached to purchase the firm's commonstock at 17.50 dlrs. There will be 7.5 mln warrants in all,with a term of 10 years.    The planned convertible preferred stock will carry adividend rate equivalent to three months LIBOR plus an as yetundecided premium, the document said. There will be no sinkingfund for the preferred stock, which will have 10-year warrantsattached to buy BankAmerica common stock.    The rest of the details of the preferred stock issue haveyet to be worked out.    On both the preferred stock and note issues, BankAmericasaid that a fixed rate alternative was possible.    The document said that BankAmerica was also open to raisingfunds in yen, if that was desirable for the Japanese.    Those present at the meeting today were working-levelofficials from 13 city, three long-term credit and seven trustbanks, Japanese banking sources said.    Newman expressed hope that certain banks would act as leadmanagers of the projected debt securities but did not namespecific banks, the sources said.

It lifted annual dividend to 24 centsfrom 22 with a final of 13, against 11 previously.    Hardie had concentrated resources on building up its corebusinesses of building products, paper merchanting andtechnology and services, it said in a statement.    Hardie said it sold a number of businesses during the yearwhich were unable to meet objectives for return on investmentor market share and some non-core units.    This resulted in a decline in sales to 1.50 billion dlrsfrom 1.56 billion, but also contributed to a fall of about 100mln dlrs in borrowings by year-end and a 36 pct drop ininterest expense to 29.16 mln dlrs, it said.    Hardie said a 42 pct jump in second-half net earnings to29.66 mln dlrs from 20.92 mln a year earlier was particularlypleasing in view of the difficult trading conditions faced bythe building products businesses in Australia.    The problems in U.S. Irrigation operations which adverselyaffected 1985/86 earnings have been overcome, Hardie said.

He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.    Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange saidthe vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New SouthWales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morningtrading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamentalnews due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and lowstocks.    Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentratescould convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although thisdepended on the quality of the concentrates.    A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supplypipeline, particularly in North America, they noted.

Morgan Securities Inc,acting as lead manager of its first corporate debt deal.    "To our knowledge, this is the first time that an affiliateof a bank holding company has been a manager of a corporatebond offering in the U.S.," a spokesman for J.P. Morgan and CoInc said.    J.P. Morgan Securities is an affiliate of J.P. Morgan andCo, the fifth largest bank in the U.S.    The J.P. Morgan spokesman explained that because the PEFCOnotes are guaranteed by the U.S. government, the securitiesaffiliate was not prohibited by the Glass-Steagall Act fromunderwriting the issue.    Indeed, Bankers Trust Co and Citicorp Investment Bank,which are affiliates of Bankers Trust New York Corp andCiticorp respectively, were co-managers of the PEFCO offering.    Passed by Congress in 1933, Glass-Steagall bars commercialbanks from owning brokerage firms and engaging in suchinvestment banking activities as underwriting corporatesecurities or municipal revenue bonds.    Last year, several major U.S. banks formed investmentbanking affiliates and applied to the Federal Reserve Board forauthorization to offer commercial paper and underwrite andtrade municipal revenue bonds and some forms of mortgage-backedsecurities.    J.P. Morgan Securities received permission from the Fedseveral weeks ago for these activities, the spokesman said.    But the Securities Industry Association, a trade group ofinvestment banking firms, appealed the decision. J.P. Morganalso appealed because it believed the Fed placed too manyrestrictions on the bank's affiliate, the spokesman said.    "The Securities and Exchange Commission got a stay, so weare not engaging in those activities," the J.P. Morganspokesman said.    "We are perfectly eligable to underwrite this offering. Weare endeavoring to prove that there is nothing mysterious aboutthis business," the spokesman said.    He added, "Ruling off certain markets does not serve thepublic policy.    J.P. Morgan Securities was formed in April 1986 withcapitalization of 250 mln dlrs, the spokesman said. At year-end1986, the firm had 261.5 mln dlrs of capital.    Dillon, Read and Co Inc, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets andSalomon Brothers Inc also served as co-managers of the PEFCOdeal.    The issue's yield was 50 basis points over comparableTreasury securities. The notes are non-callable for life. Atop-flight AAA rating by Moody's and Standard and Poor's isanticipated.    The gross spread is 5.75 dlrs, the selling concession is3.50 dlrs and the reallowance is two dlrs.    The spokesman said J.P.

The plan was worked out by Democrats who control both Houseand Senate but who have been stalemated for a month overdifferent House and Senate budgets that passed earlier.

reut2-018.sgm, RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA, European coffee traders and roastersmay propose a new formula for calculating International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meetinghere this week, traders and officials told Reuters.    Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of thepossible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, theworld's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for thenext two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.    "The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil'sattitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said.    However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,which began here today and is to continue to the end of theweek, has revealed gaps in the European position onre-introducing quotas.    Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was againstre-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally infavour with the single proviso that there had to be someformula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producingcountries.    The roasters said the positions were generally fairlyclose, and problems with some Government officials.    Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarizedGovernment attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.    Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quotare-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.    "Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by theend of the week to at least present a common European Community(EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of theInternational Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July," one trader said.    "We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that notonly the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"one official said.    "We have learned that we can live without the quotas thatwere suspended in February last year, but would prefer thestability they can bring to the market as long as we do notsimply return to the old and outdated status quo as far asquota allocation is concerned," he added.    Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on thelikelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildlypessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.    "Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On theconsumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quotare-introduction, " he said.    "The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the newBrazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the leastnegotiable position of any of his predecessors," one tradersaid.    "However, with many producers starting to swing in favour ofthe consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated undera new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, whichgives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quotameeting in September," the official said.

Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak."    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for"strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of "over-production and price interventionin the developed nations."

reut2-018.sgm, BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS, U.S. House and Senate budgetnegotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reachedyesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spendingon agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from thefarm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for atotal of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculturecommittees with difficult choices on how to make changes inagriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targetswithout jeopardizing popular support payments, seniorCongressional aides told Reuters.    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to findthe budget savings.    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grainssubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheatand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrsand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza hassaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely tobe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers anda strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who saidfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other majorgrain export competitors and would not achieve the budgetsavings Glickman claims.    Another area where Glickman and other have said budgetsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,ARP, levels for wheat and corn.    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong standwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 cropwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Mostcommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.    Congressional sources said the only way to achievesignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boostthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source saidsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen asunfair to one commodity.    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is mostlikely to eventually look for budget savings are sometightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billionbut not enough, they said.    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculturecommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut onall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including pricesupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to theGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm BureauFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities. Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS, Some OPEC states are unhappy about theprices assigned to their crude oil but this should not posegreat problems when the group reviews its six-month-old priceand output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conferencepresidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievancesabout price differentials making some of their crudesuncompetitive.    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders thatOPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of pricedifferentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the marketsignals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.    "All OPEC members can make a good case for changingdifferentials," said one analyst with a major oil company. "Butat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave wellalone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also sawsales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminishedcustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,marketing incentives have helped their sales.    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes bymeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongsidebetter priced grades in a "package."    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at leastfor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC shouldchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand forfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. Atits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixedprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel referencepoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985when members offered discounts to attract customers.    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarterand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extendor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do notmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlrtarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,analysts say.    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and onenon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key exportcrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oilexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts sayonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells atofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processingor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance topay the new prices.   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank belowits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output hasrisen.    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and sayits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's KleinwortGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push thedifferentials question in Vienna.    "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, whichholds the presidency, raised the issue," he said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE, Analysts said they were surprised atthe government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus forfiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policystatements and positive for the economy.    Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplusfor the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrsagainst a 1.95 billion deficit last year.    Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surpluswas even more positive than the most bullish analysts'forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.    Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reutersbefore the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.    The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond andthe foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despitelower interest rates, as overseas investors became moreconfident about investing in New Zealand, he said.    However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, sayingthe local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and willmove lower.    The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in afterhours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budgetrelease.    Analysts said the budget was also positive for the sharemarket, despite an increase in the contribution of companytaxation to revenue figures.    One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplusannouncement could push the share market up by 50 pointstomorrow.    The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with acontinuation of existing policies, and the absence oftraditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positivelyby overseas investors, another said.    But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-taxavoidance measures could damage some sectors of the sharemarket, particularly multi-national companies.    The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. Therequirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mlnN.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.    Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable andthere appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, anothereconomist said. He added that the document seemed entirelycredible.    "Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,"he said.    An election is due before the end of September. REUTER&#3;

Butter consumption rose to 4.1 kilos per head in 1986 fromfour kilos in 1985, while margarine consumption including lowfat margarine, fell to 14 kilos per head from 14.3 kilos.    The low fat margarine figure remained static at 2.6 kilosper head, while ordinary margarine fell from 11.7 kilos perhead to 11.4 kilos.    However, cheap butter schemes may not be the onlycontributory factor in the changes. The MVO figures show afairly steady rise in total butter consumption and fall inmargarine consumption since 1973.    A graph produced in the MVO annual report shows total Dutchmargarine consumption in 1973 at just under 210,000 tonnesagainst around 165,000 in 1986.    The same graph shows total butter consumption in 1973 atjust over 30,000 tonnes compared with just short of 60,000tonnes last year.    However, during the same period total Dutch edible fat andoil consumption on a fat content basis has risen from around345,000 tonnes to 360,000 tonnes, or an average of 24.8 kilosper head in 1986.

reut2-018.sgm, INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM IDEAS, Indonesia rejected World Bankrecommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, asthe country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak."    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for"strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of "over-production and price interventionin the developed nations."

reut2-018.sgm, U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS, Today's U.K. Economic data have pushedthe chances of another base lending rate cut from the currentnine pct further into the distance, analysts said.    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturingproduction data showed that the economy is still strong anddoes not need a fillip from lower rates.    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,taken together with higher than expected bank lending and moneysupply growth, revived inflation worries and monetaristarguments against easier credit, they said.    "The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed backall the while. The strength of the economy and broad moneygrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the nearterm," said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday'smortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societiessaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.Rates.    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week thata post-general election cut was imminent, supported by suchoptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise whichmirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling'sstrength.    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasmabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidlyreplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlyingaverage earnings in April, dealers said.    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lendingrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bankof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offsetthe impact on domestic money supply of its currentintervention.    "The gilt market reaction was correct," said Bill Martin,chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.    "That's very important ... It shows the economy in a verygood state indeed," Skeoch said.    "There's no reason to get worries about inflationarypressures because they're very subdued." Unit wage cost riseswere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year toApril, and it was these costs rather than average earningswhich were potentially inflationary, he added.    "I don't think these average earnings numbers are a majorproblem," agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worriedabout the funding implications of recent intervention.    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assetsearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes thatthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, nowlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities tryto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort GrievesonSecurities, said any fresh sterling strength would stilltrigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signalhigher inflation this year.    "Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. Aslong as that continues we're okay," he added. REUTER&#3;

"As I see it, the case for fundamental reform in our bankingand financial system is compelling," Corrigan told the SenateBanking Committee.

reut2-018.sgm, ARCO &lt;ARC> SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS, Atlantic Richfield Co, considering aspin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, couldgain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analystsestimated.    Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points onrumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based onabout 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy wasvaluing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.    Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statementaround mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct ofthe unit, leading investors to take profits.    After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.    "It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhatdisappointing," said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. Hesaid rumors of the spin-off had been around "for a couple ofdays."    Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn'tgetting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and itsvalue was not reflected in the company's stock price.    Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein saidthe unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year andhe expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.    Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena sayschemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth aboutthree billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500to 600 mln dlrs.    Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stakebecause chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated thecompany would use the proceeds to pay down debt.    But he added the possibility remained the deal would fallthrough. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet beenpresented to its board.    The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billiondlrs.    Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, CFTC'S DAVIS URGES CAUTION ON OFF-EXCHANGE ISSUE, Regulations governing hedging and riskmanagement should be revised and development of new futuresinstruments cautiously monitored in dealing with the growth ofoff-exchange futures instruments, Robert Davis, a commissioneron the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, said.    Davis told the Chicago chapter of the Futures IndustryAssociation Commodity Research Division last night "there is nocause for undue alarm" in the growth of off-exchangeinstruments.    However, he said, the CFTC "must clarify jurisdictional andregulatory issues" by maintaining the safeguards intended bycommodity regulations while encouraging "the furtherdevelopment of competitive markets."    "There is not a single off-exchange issue, there cannot beone policy approach, and to the extent that problems exist,there cannot be one solution," Davis said.    The development of off-exchange instruments with futurescontract characteristics has become of increasing concern tofederal regulators who are trying to define what issues arecovered under existing regulations and where new regulationsare needed to protect private investment.    Davis said the CFTC should step up enforcement whereoff-exchange instruments are intended to compete withexchange-traded issues, correct "regulatory inflexibility"which may force new instruments off exchange, and "delineateand separate those harmful off-exchange developments from themany that are not."    "We cannot ignore that some of the growth of off-exchangetrading represents a desirable further development of financialforward contracts that complement, rather than compete with,the relatively new financial futures contracts," Davis said.    He said a CFTC task force is continuing its investigationof the off-exchange issue. Reuter&#3;

The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine andfourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC.    The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers andsteeply increase the costs of industries such as potatoprocessing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said.    "A move by these industries to countries outside the ECcannot be ruled out," he added.    De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fatswould be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugelyexpensive administratively.    He also said the proposed tax contravened not only articlethree of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), theLome Convention, and the United Nations Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO) guidelines, but also the EC's own Treaty.

Under the new tax law, the company said annual net incomeincludes net investment income from interest less expenses, pluor minus any ordinary currency gains or losses realized inconnection with the sale of debt securities.

At present time, the company said such currency gainsamount to about 40 cts per share.

reut2-018.sgm, BONN SHOULD SPEED UP TAX REFORM, INSTITUTE SAYS, West Germany's proposed tax reform shouldbe brought forward to stimulate economic growth and head offU.S.-led pressure on Bonn to take further fiscal steps to helpboost the world economy, the Ifo economic institute said.    An Ifo report said, "The total growth effect of the reformcould be considerably enhanced, and international pressure onthe government therefore reduced, if a larger portion of thetax cuts planned by 1990 were brought forward to 1988."    Swift action is required to remove growing doubts about howthe 44 billion mark tax reform will be financed, Ifo said.    The report says the tax reform will be insufficient and toolate to stimulate economic growth, as demanded by WestGermany's industrial partners.    Since the lion's share of cuts worth a gross 44 billionmarks "will not go into effect before 1990, their impact ongrowth will be too little, too late," said Ifo.    The West German government has consistently said that bycutting taxes and encouraging consumer spending it is boostingdomestic demand and making a significant contribution to worldeconomic growth.    Bonn has agreed to increase the scope of tax reductionsplanned for 1988. In March, the government said 1988 tax cutswould be expanded by 5.2 billion marks to 13.7 billion.    A month later, economics minister Martin Bangemanncountered a joint call from all five German economic institutesto speed up tax cuts by saying such a step would endangerefforts to consolidate the budget and keep new public borrowingdown.    Financing the tax reform has become an "acute problem," Ifosaid.    "Currently, every proposal over financing (the reform) comesup against political opposition. There will be a lot morecriticism before the outstanding 19.4 billion marks needed tofinance the reform has been accounted for," the report said.    The government has pledged to agree by the Autumn how toraise around 19 billion marks still needed to finance tax cuts.Subsidies paid to ailing industries are the major target.    But even leading coalition members like Matthias Wissmann,economics spokesman for the ruling Christian Democratic party,have conceded that subsidy cuts exceeding five billion marksare unrealistic, leaving a remaining 14 billion marks to befound.    An increase in public borrowing will be inevitable to helpfinance the tax cuts, but Bonn should be able to cope withthis, the report said.    Despite vigorous opposition from the Free Democrats, thejunior partners in the centre-right coalition government, Bonnwill eventually be forced to increase value added tax (VAT) dueto tax harmonisation measures within the European Community.

The decision is to be made public later today, chiefinformation officer Ann Sicotte said.    Sicotte said the board rejected tha application after fourmonths of hearings because Hydro-Quebec did not offer theelectricity first to Canadian provinces and could not prove itwas surplus to Canadian needs.    Sicotte said Hydro-Quebec can apply for a review of thedecision if there are new facts or changed circumstances, andcould also launch an appeal with the federal court or file anew application.    Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said the utility hadnot yet been officially notified and will have to study thedecision before deciding what action to take.    The contract was a 10-year agreement with power exportsbeginning in 1990. "They weren't able to demonstrate that theelectricity was surplus and one way to demonstrate that is byoffering it to neighboring provinces," Sicotte said.    Hebert said the utility argued that it can generate  enoughelectricity to supply its U.S. and Canadian customers.    "Our position is that electricity is a manufacturedproduct--so everyboday can manufacture it and anybody can buysome--if they (the provinces) want to buy some from us, we'rewilling to discuss it," he said.    The application is the first the National Energy Board hasrejected outright, Sicotte said.    New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland hadopposed the contract at Energy Board hearings this spring. Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX, A spokesman for the EuropeanCommunity Commission defended the controversial plan for a levyon oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to helpalleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.    Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission'sDirectorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oilsand Fats Contact Days "the Commission firmly believes that thesacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers inthe oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers tomake an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problemwithin that sector by paying a levy."    The proposed tax is necessary because the level ofbudgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseedsproduction has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion EuropeanCurrency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's "standstill"agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would thenfeel the full impact of its enlargement.    The Commission has proposed several cost and productioncutting measures which include the introduction of a maximumguaranteed quantity system, he added.    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumerprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghesaid.    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatoryamount when market prices are below or above this level.    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatoryamount would be used to finance the Common AgriculturalPolicy's oils and fats regime.    "The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to theproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incompleteor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal," he said.    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.    It would not be discriminatory because it would be appliedto domestic and imported products, and past experience showedit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they dounder present aid arrangements, he said.    The competitiveness between different oils, whether ECproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantitiesimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,Tanghe said.    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overalleffect would stabilise Community production levels withoutaffecting demand, he said.    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain currentimport levels, he said.    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they areimported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and mealsrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from importedbeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

reut2-018.sgm, GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE, The rate of increase in world palm oiluse is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said.    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said.    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm.    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season.    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said.    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth.    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.

reut2-018.sgm, EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CRITICISES U.S TRADE MEASURES, The European Community (EC) accused theUnited States of violating a political commitment to free tradethrough practices including a tax on imported gasoline and acustoms user fee.    EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to thesurveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.    Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States incriticising Brazil for extending its list of products for whichimport licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as toimprove its balance of payments.    The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rulesby restricting imports of agricultural products through animport licensing system. The United States asked forconsultations with Tokyo on the issue.    Tran charged that the trade measures contravened apolitical commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.    When ministers established the four year Uruguay round tonegotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATTsurveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATTjargon as "standstill and rollback."    Tran criticised Washington for the "superfund" tax on oilimports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a specialmachine tool (known as category FSC34) from its governmentprocurement list for reasons of national security.    Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended thepolicies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.    The surveillance body will send a record of today's talksto the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,to decide any further action on the charges.    The oil tax and customs user fee have already been thesubject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside theUruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.    The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel'sreport and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil importsbreached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify itslegislation.    Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,brought the dispute to the GATT last year. Reuter&#3;

Some bankers had feared that banks would refuse to lend newmoney so soon after taking a "hit" on the old loans, buttoday's news delivers a decisive rebuff to those skeptics.

reut2-018.sgm, ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT, Zambia's copper mining industry is hopingto achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes ayear in the next few years despite low world prices,deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industryofficials said.    But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a toughInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program hasintroduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructurethe ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.    Copper production by the government-controlled ZambiaConsolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial yearended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from arecord 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.    "We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financialyear, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes dueto greater availability of spares and equipment," a ZCCMofficial said.    ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, anotherstrategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.    Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonneshigher than the previous year and the best production achievedto date.    Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copperindustry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Miningis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of thecountry's foreign exchange earnings.    Production has also been seriously affected in recent yearsby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages ofspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes outputlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.    A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the AfricanDevelopment Bank and the World Bank.    The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining andmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.    ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, hassaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce aspart of the plan.    More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into theindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability underthe five-year restructuring plan.    Company officials said although reserves were beingdepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond theend of the century, though at lower levels of production.    Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit forthe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mlnkwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level beinglevied, a net loss is likely to be registered.    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 comparedwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose asthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just overtwo to the dollar.    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished theauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economicstrategy based on national resources.    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects thebreak with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.    "We are still consulting to see how the new measures willaffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fareunder the new situation," Peter Hansen, director of operationsand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchangerate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's exportprofits.    "Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-evenpoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar," FrederickChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambianindustry.    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United Statesand under 40 cents in Chile.    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambiabeing landlocked. The government confirmed this year it hadstopped sBending copper south through South Africa.    Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, aresent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares andfuel.

The company also falsely advertised that Kraft Singlescontained more calcium than do most imitation cheese slices,the FTC charged.    The FTC complaint also charged that Kraft said it couldsubstantiate these claims when, in fact, it could not.    "Nutritional information is important to consumers, but itcan be difficult for them to verify." FTC Bureau of ConsumerProtection Director William MacLeod said in a statement. "Thatis why we seek to maintain the accuracy of nutritional claims."    The FTC, which voted 4-1 in favor of issuing the complaint,generally takes such action when it has reason to believe thatthe law has been or is being violated and where it apears tothe commission that a proceeding is in the public interest.    The filing of an administrative complaint marks thebeginning of a proceeding that often takes up to a year inwhich the allegations will be ruled upon after a formalhearing.    If the commission's allegations are upheld, Kraft could beprohibited from misrepresenting the calcium or other nutrientcontent of its cheese-type products, including those made incomparative ads.    The company could also be prohibited from making suchclaims without having competent and reliable scientificevidence. Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, WEST TEXAS COTTON CROP UNSCATHED BY STORM, The West Texas cotton crop was largelyunscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last nightthat packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather expertssaid.    "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainlynothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extensionagronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far WestTexas.    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the NewYork cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25cents.    "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, andwhen that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, asenior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, whichproduces about 80 pct of that state's crop.    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricaneforce. But they were isolated to just a small portion of theWest Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.    "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in Julyor August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have beenworse," Mohler said.    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has beenplanted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend ifweather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavierthan normal rainfall for several weeks, he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING, A trade-led boom in the U.S. isunlikely this year or next because growth in net exports willmerely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending andother sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in itslatest economic report.    Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending willcontribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.    "Growth in consumer spending in the United States will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income," Van Dyke said.    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.    The report was released before the Commerce Departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before.    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.    "For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988or 1989 is more than a remote possibility," Van Dyke said.    Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on animprovement in trade. "However, with protectionist attitudes onthe rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk," headded. Reuter&#3;

Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in theUnited States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, ornon-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spotsupplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,analysts said.    Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competingpipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the Southclosed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union hasrelied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.     In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrsper mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gascosts four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.    Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide openaccess to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fearof accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.    Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers forgas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.    Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount ofsupplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, aBrooklyn Union official said.    Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidmost of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed throughto rate payers.    While net effect on the company will not be known forseveral months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,will end up paying more for gas, he said.    Because the closure takes place in summer months when gasdemand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would besmall, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson LufkinJenrette, said.    If the situation persists into winter heating season, highcost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.    Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco forspot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high costfactor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager withend users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokeringfirm, said.    "But these companies are not unwitting victims of thetake-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers," he said.    Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's requestfor an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facilityfor spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.    Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas willthreaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting toalternative fuels, he said.    In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is beingnegotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.    Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gasfor them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatoryon the inventory charge, he said.    "Cool heads will prevail," DLJ's Launer said, " but it maytake a while."        Reuter&#3;

Glaxo's was trading at 27-7/8, off 1/2, on volume of1,786,800 shares. Shares of SmithKline Beckman &lt;SKB>, maker ofthe popular anti-ulcer drug Tagamet, also fell 7/8 to 60-1/4.    "Anything that raises the possiblity of an entirely newtherapy for ulcers would attack the core of Glaxo's worldwidebusiness, which is Zantac," said David MacCallum, an analystwho follows Glaxo for Hambrecht and Quist.       Zantac is the world's most prescribed drug with annualsales of over one billion dollars, accounting for almost 75 pctof Glaxo's earnings, said MacCallum.    "If there is any perception that Zantac is not the therapyof choice for ulcers, Glaxo's sales and profits could decline,"said Tina Rizopuolos, an analyst with Alexanders Laing andOr'kshnk.    Rizopuolos said the New England Journal article, led by aUniversity of Toronto researcher, concludes from a study of 71children with gastric disease that bacteria could causegastritis and ulcers.       In an editorial in the same issue of the medical journal,Richard Hornick of the University of Rochester School ofMedicine, reviewed studies using antibiotics to treat ulcers.Rizopuolos said Hornick concludes that the bacteria ulcerrelationship is "exciting and intriguing," but further studiesare needed to show a direct causal effect.    Ulcers happen when the stomach's protective lining erodesand is exposed to underlying inflamed tissue, but it is unknownwhat actually causes the process.   It is known that stomach acids exacerbate ulcers and thereforeantacids were commonly used to alleviate ulcers before Tagametand Zantac came along. Both of these drugs prevent the releaseof the hormone histamine in the stomach, which triggers acidsecretion.    "I don't think people should run out and sell Glaxo," saidanalyst Rizopuolos. "It will take a long time to displaceTagamet and Zantac...those drugs are going to be prescribed byphysicians for a long time," she added.    Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, GILLETTE &lt;GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR, Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon GroupInc &lt;REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for GilletteCo that could draw some big international players and in theprocess make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analystssaid.    Several hours before a regularly scheduled board ofdirectors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requestedconsent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs pershare. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed inNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.    "I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette andmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he standsto make a ton of money," said Andrew Shore, analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. "In play" is a term used on Wall Street todescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwilingtakeover target.    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlongets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette throughNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs pershare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain ofthree yesterday.    The agreement would be calculated on the basis ofPerelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for asplit. For example, a deal between Gillette and some othercompany at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmenreturned telephone calls seeking comment.    "Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money ifsomeone else takes over Gillette," said Analyst Deepak Raj ofMerrill Lynch and Co. "I'm not saying that is going to happenbut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45dlrs per share."    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasonswhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiringGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlonprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company twoyears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon'soperations. "He's trying to overhaul and improve the image ofthe dearptment store business." Another reason is that Revlonhas recently made two other acquisitions.    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised ifsome company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and GambleCo &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers forGillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and RalstonPurina Co &lt;RAL>.    "Perelman is trying to put the company in play," said aWall Street arbitrageur. "He gets to share in the upside if thecompany is sold." Another arbitrageur said he expects Gilletteto resist Perelman's overture. "I can't see the boardconsenting, what has changed between November and now," hesaid.       Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on."Perelman never does anything without a fair amount ofcalculation," he said. But he added, "The Gillette board has tobe careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued byshareholders." Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released byGillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive mergeragreement without any financing condition. He said CitibankN.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financialadviser. Reuter&#3;

Funding for the project, formally known as the StrategicDefence Initiative (SDI), has so far amounted to some 7.5billion dlrs, parliament's Defence Committee said.    But British contractors have won only 34 mln dlrs of this-- 20 mln dlrs on a government-to-government basis, with therest secured directly by U.K. Firms and institutions.    In December 1985, Britain and the United States signed aMemorandum of Understanding (MoU) relating to cooperativeresearch for the Strategic Defence Initiative.    At the time, hopes were expressed that U.K. Industrialparticipation would lead to significant spin-off of technology,both of other defence areas and to the civil sector.    But the all-party committee report said "the debate aboutthe merits of U.K. Participation in SDI has now to be conductedwithin a rather different context than was the case when theMoU was negotiated.... It has become evident that SDIparticipation may not be the great bonanza that some thought."    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been one ofPresident Reagan's few staunch supporters on his plan todevelopment an anti-ballistic missile defence screen.    But government sources said she has become angry aboutbureaucratic barriers to British companies trying to break intothe lucrative American defence market generally -- a viewvoiced again today by her defence minister, George Younger.    He told a gathering here of British and Americanbusinessmen, "We in Europe greatly welcome the emphasis whichyou in the U.S. Have placed on cooperation and collaboration inthe defence equipment sphere."    He added, "But I do worry that the failure of important andinfluential individuals in Congress and elsewhere to realisethe true nature of the two-way street in terms of ideas,technology and equipment will lead to the erection ofartificial barriers."    "I am afraid that the danger signals are only too visible inthe form of both of the legislative proposals which seem toarise with ever increasing frequency on (Capitol) Hill, and ofnew regulations from the U.S. Administration," Younger said.    "The defence balance of trade with the U.K. and other alliesis still markedly in favour of the U.S."    Thatcher will visit Washington next month for talks withPresident Reagan. U.K. Government officials said she wouldprobably raise the subject of defence trade when they meet.    The report by Parliament's Defence Committee said that theBritish position towards SDI was based on four points agreedbetween Thatcher and Reagan in December 1984, they being that:    - The aim was not superiority, but to maintain balance    - SDI-related deploymewnt would be a matter for negotiation    - The overall aim is to enhance, not undercut, deterence    - East-West negotiation should aim to achieve security withreduced levels of offensive systems on both sides.    The committee in its report said, "we very much support thegovernment's view that SDI research should proceed only withinthe framework of the Camp David "four points" and in particularthat it should be in entire conformity with the provisions ofthe ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty."    "We note that all present and envisaged SDI work undertakenby UK contractors falls in the "narrow" interpretation of thetreaty, (and) we recommend that the government takes theappropriate steps to ensure that this continues to be the case."    That definition prohibits the U.S. And Soviet Union fromdeveloping, testing or deploying ABM systems, experts said.    That recommendation would of course change, it added, if "ithas become clear that the Soviet Union has taken the lead inrenouncing the constraints of the narrow interpretation."    Regarding possibilities for technology spin-offs, thecommittee report said that "the present predominance of "paperstudies" in SDI contracts awarded to British firms andinstitutions militates against any such achievement."

Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended hiscontroversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether theyapprove of the proposal.    The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs perbushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs forsoybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls onplanted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrsfor wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.    Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world marketsharing cartel with the European Community and other exportingnations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during thefirst of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearingsexamining farm programs.    Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his"Family Farm Act."    -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm incomeand reduce government spending on agriculture.    -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would notruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but wouldincrease overall revenue from exports.    This would be done by seeking agreement among majorexporting countries including the European Community on marketsharing at agreed high prices.    Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearingthat such a grain export cartel is not workable.    -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supportswould be passed onto consumers, but he said high food pricesstem more from "gouging" by food processing companies than fromhigh farm product prices.    Harkin cited what he termed "excessive" net returns onequity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pctMonfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pctQuaker Oats.    -- Harkin said a "legitimate" concern about his bill wouldbe the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.    He said as a transition to the higher prices, he wouldallow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.grain stocks for three years.    Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a"predictable and stable" grain price, he said.    -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farmparticipation would be no more "mandatory" than the currentfarm program. He said farmers now must participate in farmprograms in order to receive credit for planting and to protectfarm income. Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, OECD SEES GERMAN GROWTH HIT BY LOW DOMESTIC DEMAND, West German economic growth will slow to1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domesticdemand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisationfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in itssemi-annual review of the world economy.    This view is less favourable than the West Germangovernment's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct thisyear, but is in line with forecasts by independent economicinstitutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.    The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,with the gross national product rising by two pct in realterms.    The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passingthrough a period of temporary weakness and there would be somerecovery in business confidence in the near future.    But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economywas higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.    While noting that the government is bringing forward a fivebillion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that "themedium to longer-term performance of the West German economycould be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allowrelatively lower tax rates."    Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German FederalStatistics Office has released figures showing that the GNPactually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter ofthis year compared with the final three months of 1986.    Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appearedlikely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any ofthe Group of Seven leading industrial nations.    West Germany's current account surplus, the target ofconsiderable criticism by the Reagan administration, isexpected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in1988.

In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECDforecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said therate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantlyhigher than in the first half of this year.    The OECD said France's economic situation has deterioratedsomewhat during the early months of 1987.     Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventoryadjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflationhas reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely toreach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.    The report said inflation should slow and domestic demandpick up in the second half of this year. But both data arelikely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.    The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices forthe second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first sixmonths. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pctfor the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct. REUTER&#3;

But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast aslightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Lastyear Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growingeconomies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.    The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.    The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around fivepct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround inimport prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labourcosts and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the reportsaid.    This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demandshould be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumptionmade possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.    Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration inItalian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports andadversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result ina sharp negative contribution to the currrent account. REUTER&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD, Japan's trade surplus is likely tocontinue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroadincrease while domestic demand remains sluggish, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)said.    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, theOECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus lastyear, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 whileexport markets rose by only two pct.    But it said this differential between the growth ofdomestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,"thus weakening the international adjustment process."    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over twopct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pctin 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 willrise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billionyen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demandand increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said themeasures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quitepossibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects haveworked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.    The OECD outlook said, "Continued large current accountsurpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantialnet external asset position could well lead to upward pressureon the yen." It said that further appreciation could then leadmanufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thusweaken domestic growth.    The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely togorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pctgrowth. But it said Japan would continue its good performanceon inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year. Reuter&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT, U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen ifthe two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policyresearch groups.    The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Instituteof Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on crossborder trade would benefit both countries.    But Cato chairman William Niskanen added "the two nations'generally harmonious trade relations are probably notsustainable without a new agreement."    The United States and Canada, whose cross-border tradetotaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holdingtalks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriersremaining between their two countries.    The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but bothsides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargainingremained.    Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade tiescould deteriorate because of Congressional pressure onPresident Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, andthis could hit some Canadian trade practices.    He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its autoindustry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateralfree trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.    Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable toa resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.exports to Canada.    A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada andenable its industries to achieve economies of scale, whichwould also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.    It would also increase the gross national products of bothcountries.    Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end alltariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rulesfor trade in services and investments, end curbs on governmentprocurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

reut2-018.sgm, ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN SLUGGISH IN BENELUX COUNTRIES, Economic growth will remain sluggish inthe Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment mayrise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Developmentforecast.    Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year andnext year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECDsaid in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation couldstabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surpluswill probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.    While the Belgian government has made progress in trimmingits borrowing requirement, "it will probably be insufficient tocheck the self-sustaining nature of the deficit," the OECD said.    In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becomingless competitive and imports rising. "Employment is forecast todecelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in theprivate sector and budgetary cuts," the report said.    Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of decliningdomestic gas prices.    Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly fastergrowth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement inwages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year.REUTER&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH, Strong growth in domestic demand was a keyfeature of the economies of southern European countries in1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.    In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's totaldomestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year tofive pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growthrestrained private consumption.    Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 anddomestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expectedto be halved to five pct next year.    In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,had been the driving force behind rapid growth in GrossDomestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumptionwere expected to ease during 1988 but would still remainstrong.    The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharplynext year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the EuropeanCommunity and declining competitiveness.    In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwardsfollowing an increase early this year linked with theintroduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices dueto cold weather. REUTER&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, OECD SAYS HIGH WAGE DEALS HARMING NORDIC STATES, High wage settlements in Nordic countriesthreaten to cut exports and reduce the internationalcompetitiveness of their industries, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded inearly 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deteriorationin competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seenat risk from accelerating wages.    The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come underpressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well asNorway, Sweden and Finland.    Overall economic growth will vary in the differentcountries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual reportsaid.    After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domesticdemand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and onepct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see aslump in domestic demand. The report said growth in GrossDomestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly inSweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmarkand Norway.    Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economicstrategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustainedand balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-018.sgm, OECD URGES ACTION TO CUT U.S. BUDGET DEFICIT, The United States should take urgentaction to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possiblereductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs ongrowth of the defense budget, the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development said.    The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congressquickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit "could seriouslyaffect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere."    It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,running until September 30 this year, would substantiallyovershoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billiondlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.    "The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions ofslower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for thefirst half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190billion dollars," it said.    While this would be 30 billion lower than last year'sdeficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate taxincreases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.    The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.    In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exportsboosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.    Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the servicesector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to beheading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumerprices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct nextyear after just 2.1 pct in 1986.    "Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factorsbehind the avoidance of recession," the report said.    The current account balance of payments deficit is expectedto be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, afterhitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.    In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightlyto around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but willstill be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation isexpected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pctthis year.    Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink toaround four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at aboutthat level in 1988. Reuter&#3;

reut2-018.sgm, JOINT ACTION SAID VITAL TO BOOST WORLD GROWTH, Prospects for world economic growth remainvery sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments isurgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilizecurrencies and encourage investment, the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.    "The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large paymentsimbalances are likely to persist," it said in one of itsgloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.    The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc ofwestern industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's2.5 pct growth rate.    "We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD areacomfortably exceeding three pct," David Henderson, head of theOECD's economics and statistics department, said.    The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to risinginflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third worlddebt problem to increase the risks of a world economicdownturn.    "At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growthremain favorable," it said, citing low inflation in most majorcountries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interestrates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexiblelabor markets.    But private sector confidence had been undermined byuncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that "forconfidence to be restored, it is important for governmentsswiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments."    This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accordof the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.    The OECD said that apparent disagreements among majorcountries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped toundermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscalpolicies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demandin the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.    Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announcedrecently by the Japanese government to encourage public worksand cut taxes would make a significant contribution to thisprocess, though it was too early to estimate its preciseimpact.    He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domesticdemand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.    The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, hasworsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecastto rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pctincrease in 1986.    There is no prospect for any significant improvement in theunemployment situation over the next 18 months, with theaverage rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to lastyear.    The OECD called for efforts to liberalize worldagricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away fromprice guarantees and other measures linked to productiontowards direct income support for farmers.
