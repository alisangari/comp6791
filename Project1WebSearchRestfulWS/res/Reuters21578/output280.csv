reut2-008.sgm, LDC FOOD AID NEEDS DECLINE IN 1986/87 - USDA, Total food aid needs in 69 of theleast developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirmentsfell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, theU.S. Agriculture Department said.    In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, thedepartment said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was arecord high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.    However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened bydrought-reduced crops and civil strife.    Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheatconsumption for food to a new high, and higher yieldingvarieties have been particularly effective where spring wheatis a common crop, it said.    However, may developing countries in tropical climates,such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and CentralAmerica, are not well adapted for wheat production, andimproved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, thedepartment said.    World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in1986/87 for the third straight year.    Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oilconsumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the departmentsaid. Reuter&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA, The U.S. Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal todrastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growersfor the cut with targeted income payments.    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanyingthe "Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987", Peter Myers,Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administrationwants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginningwith the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by thegovernment for the price support cut with targeted incomepayments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments wouldcost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.    The administration sugar proposal is expected to beintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.John Porter, R-Ill.    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic itis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate becausepolitically-influential sugar and corn growersand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and graduallylowers payments over four years. It also excludes from paymentany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a growerwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.    The income payments would be based on the amount ofcommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changesin the sugar program because the current high price support iscausing adverse trends in the sugar industry.    He said the current program has artificially stimulateddomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowedcorn sweeteners to make market inroads.    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a"progressive contraction" of the sugar import quota to only onemln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugarrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing.    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program givesoverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products acompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports ofsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processingfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost onU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA saidconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more thannecessary for sugar.    "Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap betweensweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverseimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currentlyfacing," Myers said.    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts perlb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tonsrecoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal tocompensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

reut2-008.sgm, LITTLE EFFECT SEEN FROM COLD STORAGE REPORT, The USDA monthly cold storage reportfor meats is expected to have little, if any, effect onlivestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile ExchangeMonday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk ofdirection, livestock analysts said.    The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals mayprovide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said.    "I think the market is going to be looking at some otherthings and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets mightbe early next week," Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GHMiller, said.    Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futureswill be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hogmarketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business wascompleted this week and there may be less aggressive interestfor pork in general next week.    "We needed some help from the cold storage report to averta possible setback next week in the pork complex," Levitt said.    Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the bellyfigure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks weredown 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the averageexpectation and actually showed a lighter than expected declinefrom last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings,they said.    However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put instorage has been light since the beginning of March and this isa potentially bullish situation.    Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri,said, "I would not look for (belly) storage during the nextmonth or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will beless." Reuter&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, STRIKE THREAT, LOWER TRAFFIC MAR SEAWAY OPENING, The St. Lawrence Seaway, setto reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough yearbecause of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of thefirst strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officialssaid.    Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modesof transportation are all expected to result in only a marginalincrease over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- onthe 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.    In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, theseaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montrealand Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal,linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.    By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveledthrough the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln throughthe eight-lock canal.    The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrsthis year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executivemember of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority.    The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain.Those exports of the single most important commodity carried onthe waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.    The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has saidit will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers'demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.    "It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike," RomanGralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said.    The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliatorto try to hammer out a contract agreement between the twosides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships onthe Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.    "We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...aprolonged strike would have a disasterous effect," SeawayAuthority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.    "These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of theSt Lawrence Seaway," George Miller, vice-president of theCanadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of majorCanadian shipping companies, said recently.    The workers' current contract expires May 31. Theassociation said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wagesfor the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power torestructure crew dispatching.    The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs(U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic andfreight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985was its worst year in two decades.    Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls onthe Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to lastyear's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tollsthroughout the rest of the waterway.    Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks andabout 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.    "We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but wewon't see a major increase for a number of years," Hemsley said.    A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippersin Western Europe should result in some increased traffic thisseason but the full benefits won't be felt for several years,Blair said.

reut2-008.sgm, WALL STREET SURVIVES TRIPLE EXPIRATIONS, The four-times-a-year "triplewitching hour" did not jolt Wall Street as much as it has inthe past.    Market averages finished sharply higher as stock indexfutures, index options and options on individual stocks expiredsimultaenously. Some analysts warned part of the gain may beretraced next week. But there were signs Wall Street is gettingused to the phenomeon which causes a huge burst of activity inthe final minutes. Officials of the New York Stock Exchangesaid the day went smoothly and efficiently.    "This has been one of the few times that the consensus hasbeen right," said Jim Creber, trader at Miller, Tabak, Hirschand Co.    He expects a "follow-through" Monday and Tuesday to theadvance which lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average 34 pointsfor the day and 75 points for the entire week.    Creber, whose firm was one of the first to get involved inarbitrage activity involving index futures and options, saidthe general trend of the market has been upward for months."Every time the market comes in, somebody comes along with moremoney," he said.    He said investors adding to Individual Retirement Accountsprior to a mid-April tax deadline and buying from Japaneseinvestors are apparently helping push stocks higher.    Ron Feinstein, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc,said reports of heavy Japanese buying, just prior to the end ofthe fiscal year in Japan, fueled bullish sentiment.    He said investors who had long positions in stocks hedgedwith short positions in index futures rolled the expiring Marchfutures over into June contracts. But he added differentplayers with other goals also were active and there was nosimple explanation of the market's gyrations.    For example, Feinstein noted the June contract for the JuneStandard and Poor's 500 stock index future hit 300 about 15minutes prior to the close of NYSE trading. In 12 minutes, thecontracted dipped to 297.50. "That could have been a wave ofselling from institutional people making a roll," he said.    It was the first time a nearby contract of the S and P 500hit 300. The cash index closed at a record 298.17. "It lookslike the market is going to continue to go higher," he said.    "Triple expirations didn't really mean that much, it was astrong day for stocks," said Steve Chronowitz of Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co.    Chronowitz said the stock market has been underpinned by"good solid buying interest" which will cushion any pullback.    Other investors who were long futures and short stocksbought stocks on the close today instead of rolling over, saidMark Zurack of Goldman, Sachs and Co. He cautioned against"over-dramatizing" the day's activity, which said was more areflection of fundamental strength in the markets.    Leigh Stevens of PaineWebber Group Inc said what he saw wasmostly covering of short positions in stocks as index optionsand individual options expired. He said there could be adecline early next week in the stock market.    "It looked like it worked well today," said Howard Kramer,asssistant director of market regulation for the Securities andExchange Commission. But he said all of the data will have tobe analyzed next week.    He said there was relatively little commotion at the close,with about 50 mln shares changing hands in the final minutecompared to 85 mln in the triple expirations three monthsearlier. He noted the Dow industrials jumped about 12 points inthe closing minutes, a modest move for a 2333-point index.    Kramer pointed out an SEC-NYSE measure to curb volatility,disclosure of "market-on-close" orders in 50 major stocks 30minutes prior to the end of trading, showed imbalances ofmodest proportions. The disclosures are aimed at evening outvolatility by attracting orders on the opposite side of theimbalance.    The data showed more buy orders than sell orders for 47stocks, a preponderance of sell orders for only one stock, andno significant imbalance for two stocks. The NYSE had tighteneda rule governing what type of market on close orders can beaccepted in the final half hour. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, CANADA'S CLARK SEES TRADE AS MOST URGENT PROBLEM, Trade is the most urgent problemfacing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need toreach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark,Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said.    Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting formore than a year in an effort to work out an agreement.    "The most urgent problem now is the trade question becausethat has to be decided within the next 10 months," Clark toldthe Commonwealth Club of California. "We have a fast trackauthority from your Congress for approval or rejection ofwhatever the negotiators achieve."    Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initialagreement must be reached by late September or early October.    He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain,and defense as the second and third most important bilateralissues facing Ottawa and Washington.    On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rainproblem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture inadvance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, withPrime Minister Brian Mulroney.    In a question-and-answer session with the public affairsgroup, Clark said that the two countries must find bettermechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.    "This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted oncorn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they werequasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in placenow are not working adequately in either of our interests," hesaid.    Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's ruleson government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, hesaid.    "There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order tosecure substantial contracts in the United States, have had tomove their head offices out of our country into your countrybecause you have national procurement requirements," he said.    In turn, he added, the United States would like to changesome of the procurement requirements that exist at theprovincial government level in Canada.    Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.    "What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, inthe first instance, to propose, and then governments andcongresses will have judge," he said.    In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United Stateshas tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports toits northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan."Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last yearthan you bought from Canada," he said.

The budget forecasts the 1987-88 provincial deficit to be1.90 billion dlrs, compared to a forecast deficit of 3.30billion dlrs for fiscal 1987, which ends March 31, Johnstonsaid.    The budget forecasts fiscal 1988 revenues of 8.63 billiondlrs and expenditures of 10.42 billion dlrs, Johnston said.    The provincial budget raises combined personal andcorporate income taxes by about 20 pct, Johnston said.    Johnston told a news conference taxes were increased afterrevenues from oil and gas taxes fell by 64 pct last year andare not expected to increase sharply in the short term.    The provincial government expects resource tax revenues forfiscal 1987 to fall to 1.30 billion dlrs from a previouslyestimated 2.20 billion dlrs, compared to 3.60 billion dlrscollected in fiscal 1986 before the collapse in oil prices.    Johnston told reporters he needed to raise taxes in orderto begin moving towards a balanced budget in 1990-91.    Johnston said the personal income tax increase takes threeforms. The basic provincial tax rate rises to 46.5 pct from43.5 pct of the basic federal income tax rate.    The provincial budget also imposed a temporary eight pctsurtax on individuals with taxable income of more than 36,000dlrs, he said.    In addition, the government levied a flat one pct surtax onall individuals with taxable income.

reut2-008.sgm, NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE, Higher crude oil prices will raisedemand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lostto heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.    The analysts said that these efforts will be mostsuccessful in the industrial sectors of the economy with largeand growing energy requirements.    "Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share ofoil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residualfuel industry last year," Michael Smolinski, an energyeconomist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.    An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel wentinto the utilities market at the expense of natural gas lastyear when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said.     Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, nationalaverage gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive,Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at AmericanGas Association said.    The average delivered prices at the end of January were2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.    "We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubicfeet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second andthird quarter (1987)," he said.    In addition to price competitiveness, availability will bean important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas,Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp.in New York noted.    Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the NorthAmerican continent has led to a build up of gas inventories andless would be necessary to replenish underground storage thisspring freeing gas for spot sales.    These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fearsthat natural gas suplies would be tight and pricessignificantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling lastyear.    AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline,much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to productionquickly through developments such as the infill drilling whichpermits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.    Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surpluswas likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would notgo away until 1990.    Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus wouldpersist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certainconsuming areas, notably in California and in the NortheastU.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, U.S. SENATORS SAY SANCTIONS LIKELY ON MICROCHIPS, The United States will likely imposesanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators saidtoday after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige.    Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decisionwould be taken until a final determination is made on whetherJapanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they saidthey were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.    President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of whichBaldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.    "I am confident we will see action taken," Sen. John McCain,an Arizona Republican, told reporters.    "I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more thansanctions," Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.    The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductorindustry representatives met with Baldrige and State Departmentofficials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the UnitedStates and other countries.    They recommended Japanese firms be penalized throughtariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months forcontinuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.    Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen.Pete Wilson told reporters, "The clear import of what he said isthat there will be."    "Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctionsmust be applied," for past violations of the agreement, theCalifornia Republican said.    The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chipswhich are used in high technology products ranging from radiosto defence missile guidance systems.    Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige toldthem the administration had not made a final determination thatJapanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips belowthe cost of production in the United States or other countries.    But McClure said senators told him, "There is no doubtdumping is going on," based on evidence such as invoices ofpurchases of the Japanese products.    The two countries signed a pact last September in whichJapan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the UnitedStates and other countries below production costs and to allowthe U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.    In return, the United States waived its right to imposeimport duties on the Japanese microchips.    Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pactand have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output tosave the pact.    Japan has frequently been the target of congressionaldiscouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr tradedeficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the UnitedStates last year and had large surpluses with other countries.    The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolutioncalling for action against Japan for violations of the pactsince September. The resolution will be introduced in the Housenext week by Rep.

Vernon, with 1.35 billion dlrs of assets and nine officesin Texas and Oklahoma, was closed after state regulatorsconcluded it was in unsafe and unsound condition.    The thrift was owned by Texas businessman Donald Dixon, whobought it in early 1982, when it had only 120 mln dlrs inassets.

reut2-008.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BOLIVIA, Bolivia, once Latin America's mostdelinquent debtor, is preparing for a second InternationalMonetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation programhas effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending.    A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Pazshortly to discuss terms of the new agreement.    He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mlndlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends thismonth. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatoryfinancing facility and a structural adjustment facility.    The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed,Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over thenext 12 months.    Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980,opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the ParisClub and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs ofBolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.    Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters thenegotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to befinalised, had been extremely successful.    Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to rescheduleBolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace andhad waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.    Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.    Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs indisbursements this year from lender countries and internationalagencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources putthe figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.    Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves arearound 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President IctorPaz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said thecapital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits hadchanged from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a netinflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.    Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows pazestenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inheritedinflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that werelosing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded onthe black market at up to 16 times its official rate.    Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market-related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid offthousands of workers in state corporations.    Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the pastsix months, according to the Central Bank, and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pctcontraction over the last six years.    The government is also proposing a novel solution to itsdebt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interesthas not been paid since March, 1984.    Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia wouldmake a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt atthe price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial banksteering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to considerthe proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of thecountry's creditor banks will take up the offer.    One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able tobuy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under thedeal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loansto the country.    But he said the larger creditors were more interested in ascheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operatedin Chile for the past two years.    The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals fordebt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning toprivatise more than 100 state companies and these could serveas a basis for such a scheme.    Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might proveattractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as thegovernment realises that it will have to attract a large amountof new capital in order to grow.    Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reutersthat Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in newinvestment over the next 10 to 12 years.    The government realises that in order to remain viable,Bolivia will need to develop new exports.    The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct ofBolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets,and gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundantsupply in the region.

reut2-008.sgm, MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT, The new International Natural RubberAgreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stockas the sole instrument for market intervention -- excludingexport quotas or production controls.    The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held underthe auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD).    In many respects the main features in the new pact resemblethose contained in the present one.    The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singaporects per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now andOctober 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of thedaily market indicator price remains above the upperintervention ("may sell") price (231 cts) or below the lowerintervention ("may buy") price (171 cts) for six months.    If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikelyconsidering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts-- the price would be revised under the current accord by fivepct or by whatever amount the International Natural RubberCouncil decides.    The new reference price would then be taken over for thenew agreement.    Under the same circumstances in the new pact the referenceprice would be automatically revised by five pct unless theCouncil decides on a higher percentage.    Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, thereference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unlessthe Council decides on a higher percentage.    Another change introduced in the new INRA is that pricereviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18.    Those changes are intended to make the reference price moreresponsive to market trends.    As in the present accord the "may buy" and "may sell" levelsare set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the"must buy" and "must sell" levels at 20 pct of it.    The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceilingprices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless theCouncil decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months.    During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposalthat the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock,currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.    The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is thesame as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provisionfor an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes.    Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will bebrought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price.    At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking forproducers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pacthad served the purpose for which it had been created.    Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers,agreed that the current agreement had worked "relatively well."    Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA,delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accordhad maintained the average price above the "must buy" level.    They said the agreement until now did not appear to haveencouraged excessive production of rubber.    In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the bufferstock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. "It is asort of middle-of-the-road agreement," one delegate said.    The new pact will be open for signature at U.N.Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year.    To become operational, it will require ratification bycountries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct ofworld imports.    Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months fromnow. During the hiatus between the two agreements, theInternational Natural Rubber Council will remain in place.    The pact will enter into force definitively whengovernments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pctof world imports have ratified it. REUTER&#3;

The drought will affect both the summer harvest in thesouth and the spring sowing under way in the north.    It said the most seriously affected areas are Guangdong,Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hebei, Shanxi and Guangxi.    It said that, despite bigger snowfalls this year than lastin Hebei and Shanxi and more rainfall forecast for some areas,the drought will not abate in the near future.    This is because the drought has lasted so long that slightincreases in rainfall are not enough to alleviate it, the papersaid.    It said that the water level on the middle reaches of theYangtze has fallen to its lowest level in more than 110 years,so that more than 100 ports along it cannot receive ships.    Water level of other major rivers, including the Zhujiang,Qiantangjiang and Minjiang, have also been affected by thedrought, the paper added but gave no more details. REUTER&#3;

It was the second consecutive monthly fall, after droppingnine pct in January, but it was still 26.49 pct up on February1986 following a very extended rise last year.    The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154.82.    A ministry official attributed the decline to fallingproduction of non-metal products, textiles and transportationequipment, and less mining and house construction.    The official said the decline was also caused by fallingexports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar,which has made Taiwanese products more expensive.    He expected the decline to continue in the next few monthsbecause of further appreciation of the local dollar against theU.S. Currency.    The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against theU.S. Dollar since September 1985. It closed at 34.40 to theU.S. Dollar today, and is expected to rise to about 32 to thedollar by the end of this year, foreign bankers and economistssaid. REUTER&#3;

The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlightedwhen its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to deathhere in public view in June, 1985.    Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano'shome filmed two men smashing their way into the home and lateremerging with a bloodstained bayonet.    The company, established here in 1981, undertook to holdgold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwidebusiness operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employeesat its peak in early 1985.    Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensionersand housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985,according to lawyers.    Of them, some 18,000 clients cla&#127;imed they could get backneither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150billion yen, local press reports said.

reut2-008.sgm, WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA, World Bank President Barber Conable isexpected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largestdebtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes totackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.    Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, willmeet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.    He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia'slargest nation was being managed well, but the slump in worldoil prices called for major policy adjustments.    Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projectsin the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populousisland. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detaileddiscussions with ministers tomorrow.    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severelyhit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil andgas revenues in half.    Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed toprovide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesiapay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.    Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded tothe oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans tobridge its deficit.    Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suhartoand leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policychange, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-costprotected economy.    "Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all callfor major policy adjustments and external support," Conable saidin his arrival statement.    But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections nextmonth, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply thatthe Bank is demanding specific changes.    "We believe there has been wise leadership here and theeconomy is being very well managed," Conable told reporters atJakarta airport.    Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it theThird World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.    Conable did not spell out what further changes he wouldlike to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changesalready introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.    Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of thegovernment's trade reform measures, and supported itsdetermination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.    Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since lastMay to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourageoutside investment.    Suharto has also ordered a government committee to lookinto which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could besold.    But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said thegovernment appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.    Western analysts say that in particular the government isunsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-costmonopolies, which control core areas of the economy.    Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week thatIndonesia faced very limited economic choices.    It could not spend its way out of trouble because thiswould increase the balance of payments deficit and domesticinflation.     He said the main objective was to raise exports outsidethe oil and natural gas sector.    Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by thegovernment to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financialyear which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in1986/87. REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, GERMAN ECONOMY SEEN GROWING TWO PCT IN 1987, Bundesbank vice-president HelmutSchlesinger said that although West German economic growth wasnot expected to be satisfactory in the first 1987 quarter, twopct growth was still attainable for the whole of the year.    A further rise in the value of the mark would worsen exportprospects and have a negative effect on investments, he toldthe Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in an interview. But if suchan appreciation did not materialize, the economy would expand.    The federal government has predicted a growth rate of 2-1/2pct or more in its annual economic report published in January,but some economists have said the forecast was too optimistic.    Schlesinger said private consumption was likely to risestrongly. Government expenditure and construction were alsoexpected to increase. But there was uncertainty about theprospects for exports and investment.    The Bundesbank had viewed with concern the money supplyovershoot in 1986, but the sharp rise was unlikely to have aneffect on inflation in the forseeable future. However, therewere potential dangers in the long run.    Schlesinger said there was hope that in 1987 the WestGerman money supply would grow within the three to six pcttarget zone set in December.    Schlesinger said the dampening effect on inflation of thedrop in import prices could continue to a lesser degree forsome time. Prices in West Germany were likely to rise betweenone and two pct this year.    He said 1987 would be the fifth successive growth year forthe West German economy. Although there was a possibility of adownturn at some stage in the future, there were no signs thiswould happen in 1988.    The main risks for the West German economy stemmed from itsclose ties with the rest of the world, Schlesinger added. REUTER&#3;

Rostenkowski suggested that about 18 billion dlrs of newtaxes might have to be found, along with nine billion indefence and spending cuts and another nine billion in domesticspending reductions. But, he said, proposed tax rises would bebrought to the floor only if House Democratic leaders feltthere was Republican support.

reut2-008.sgm, NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND THE NAIRA, Nigeria's Central Bank has changed therules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analystssee as a means of defending the naira currency, which hasdepreciated steadily.    The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banksbidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate theyoffered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowestsuccessful bid made at the auction.    This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensurethat they were successful while paying the lower "marginal" rate,analysts said.    "It should act as a brake because banks will know that ifthey bid high they will have to pay what they offered," aWestern diplomat commented.    The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pctsince the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign ExchangeMarket (SFEM), began last September 26.    At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row.    "They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way oftrying to stop the trend," the diplomat said.    The Central Bank also announced the auctions would befortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2.    It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday'sscheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank wasplanning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offerat each auction.    Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstrippedsupply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus furtherweakening the naira.    If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at thefortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objectiveof the new system, analysts said.    Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, theofficial exchange rate for the naira applying to businesstransactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- thelowest successful bid.    SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustmentprogram, which is considered to be the most ambitious economicrecovery plan in Black Africa.    The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate forthe naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalisingimports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducinginefficient government participation in the economy.    The World Bank has played a prominent part in designingthis dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an oftensceptical public which fears inflation and lower livingstandards.    Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria,said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustmentprogram as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions.    "So far so good" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos,adding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elitewould suffer hardship while the common man would benefit.    Fears that the program would encourage inflation wereincorrect, he said.    Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urbanprices had already reflected the naira's black market valuebefore the currency was allowed to find its true level lastSeptember. REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, ECONOMIST CALLS BRAZIL DEBT REQUEST MODEST, Brazil's attempt to seek betterterms for paying off its 109 billion dlr foreign debt isresponsible and modest, a former chairman of President Reagan'sCouncil of Economic Advisers said.    "I think that what Brazil is calling for -- limiting itsdebt payments to two and one half pct of GNP -- is aresponsible request on their part," economist Martin Feldsteinsaid at a news conference.    "It requires additional money on the part of the banks, butrather modest additional amounts."    Feldstein is attending the annual meeting of the TrilateralCommission, a foreign policy group of more than 300 businessand government leaders from North America, Europe and Japan.    Feldstein, one of four members of a task force on ThirdWorld debt, said that Brazil's request would mean an additionalcredit of three billion to four billion dlrs from banks andinternational agencies.    "Brazil's debt would increase in dollar terms but remainconstant in real terms. The four billion dlr increase inBrazil's 100 billion dlr debt would represent no increase inthe real inflation-adjusted size of its liability," he said.    Feldstein said he believed current Third World debtproblems were less serious than those faced by theinternational monetary system in 1983 and 1985.    However, the European representative on the task force,Herve de Carmoy, chief executive international for Midland BankPLC, disagreed.    He called the present situation more difficult and, in adraft proposal included in the task force's report, suggestedsetting up an institution, possibly within the World Bank, witha fund that could deal with a future debt crisis.    Commission discussions were closed to reporters but it wasapparent from the news conference that task force members didnot agree on all points in their report.    One point of agreement, Feldstein said, was that debtorcountries would need additional credit in the coming years ifthey are to enjoy satisfactory growth.    Feldstein said the task force, which also included KoeiNarusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank ofToyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on howmuch credit would be needed.

Over an informal barbecue at a farm outside Sao Paulo ownedby millionaire entrepreneur Matias Machline, Sarney met morethan 20 businessmen for discussion on Brazil's economic crisis.    Business leaders said before the meeting they would bepressing for less government interference in what they describeas a tightly regulated economy.    Their concerns include the country's high rates of interestand tough restrictions on imports.    Machline, president of the Sharp electronics group and apersonal friend of Sarney's, told television reporters outsidehis farm that he wanted "less government participation in theeconomy."    When the government announced a month ago that it wassuspending interest payments on Brazil's 68 billion dlr debt tocommercial banks, it said this was a means of ensuring growthand avoiding recession.    But business leaders and economic analysts say there aregrowing signs that Brazil's economy, the eighth biggest in thenon-communist world, is heading for a downturn after 8 pctgrowth last year.    Businessmen are deeply concerned about the effect onindustry of import restrictions introduced earlier this yearbecause of the country's deteriorating trade balance.    Cacex, the foreign trade department of the federally ownedBanco do Brasil, has told companies they must limit theirimports to 90 pct of what they imported in 1985.    Business sources say that in practice importing even thisamount is difficult and they have to haggle with Cacex on acase-by-case basis.    The business daily Gazeta Mercantil reported that in manysectors of the economy there was a real fear that productionlines would grind to a halt next month.    One of those attending the talks was Mario Amato, head ofthe powerful Sao Paulo State Industries' Federation (FIESP).    Business sources said he would argue that unless there werea relaxation in import controls a sharp downturn in industrialactivity was inevitable.    Relations between Sarney and the business community have attimes been strained and the existence of these tensions pointedup the importance of the meeting.    In one bizarre dispute in January, Sarney surprisedBrazilian business leaders by declaring that they were alliesof the 19th century anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. This outburstcame after Amato warned that companies might start disobeyinggovernment regulations on price controls.    Brazilian press reports made much of the fact that FinanceMinister Dilson Funaro, chief architect of the government'seconomic policy, had not been invited to the gathering. REUTER&#3;

The bank's policy-making board of governors, meeting hereahead of this week's IADB annual meetings, put off anydecisions when it became apparent differences betweenWashington and the Latin countries ware too great.    IABD officials said Washington had indicated, however, itmight be prepared to compromise in the future.    The United States is the principal donor nation and haspressed the bank, controlled by the Latin American borrowingnations, to cede virtual veto power over loans to Washington.    The Reagan administration wants to make the bank part ofits controversial strategy to resolve the debt crisis.    The U.S. Plan calls for loans from multilateral banks likethe IADB to be tied to economic reforms in debtor nations whichwould promote open markets, reduced government intervention andinflation-free economic growth.    Brazil, which declared an interest payments moratorium lastmonth, is leading a challenge to Washington's strategy andofficials here obviously feared any decisions that might deepenrifts between the United States and Third World nations.    IADB officials also said Washington hinted at futurecompromise. "The U.S. Said it remains hopeful they can reach anagreement and expressed optimism that such a consensus could bereached," said an official who asked not to be named.    Washington has threatened to scuttle a 20-25 billion dlr,four-year capital replenishment for the bank if the veto issueis not resolved.    But it has asked Congress to give it authority to financeits one-third share in the event agreement on voting power isreached. The United States controls 34.5 pct of the vote andwants a loan veto to exist at the 35 pct level.    Currently, a simple majority can approve or disapproveloans giving the borrowing nations control of the purse stringsand resulting in loan conditions too lax for Washington'staste.    The U.S. Strategy for dealing with the debt crisis isexpected to be repeated by Treasury Secretary James Baker in aspeech to the bank's annual meeting on Monday.

Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at awelcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that greatprogress had been made in preparing for the negotiations whichmust not be sidetracked.    "We live in troubled and dangerous times for the worldtrading system," he said.    "We have seen that the failure of the world trading systemhas caused great depression and conflict in the past. Ourfailure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to usall," Moore said.    He added: "The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It isour last hope and best opportunity this century. We will notget another chance before the year 2000."    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world tradesince the "Uruguay round" talks last Sepember. The meeting isalso part of preparations for a full-scale conference of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice inJune.    The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to havebeen particularly successful, with northern hemispherecountries managing to have service industries such as bankingand insurance included in the next full round.    The southerners' goal of including agricultural andtropical products also was met.    The meeting at this North Island tourist resort isdescribed by participants as informal and no declaration isexpected.    Moore said one aim was to "instil a sense of politicalurgency to avert potential economic tragedy."    Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade topeople who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see thebenefits, as well as preventing "bush fires of confrontationwhile we proceed with orderly negotiations."    The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegationsincluding representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.    The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter.    American sources say he is ready to state that the best wayto reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is toimplement four key Uruguay proposals:    -- an end to agricultural subsidies;    -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATTregulations;    -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-calledintellectual property such as trademarks, patents andcopyrights;    -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT's 92member states.

British officials said King Fahd may ask Britain to restorediplomatic relations with Syria, broken off by London lastOctober after evidence in the trial of Nizar Hindawi showedSyrian agents were behind a plan to bomb an Israeli airliner.    But one official said the king would be told Britain stillneeds "clear and sustainable evidence that the Syrians haverenounced state-sponsored terrorism. So far they haven't."    Britain will stress its support for an international peaceconference on the Middle East and its concern over allegedhuman rights abuses by Israel in the occupied West Bank andGaza, the officials told Reuters.    The Saudi leader will hold talks with Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher and meet Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philipduring the visit, his first to Britain since he assumed powerin June 1982.    King Fahd will be accompanied by his trade, defence, oiland health ministers, who will hold talks with their Britishcounterparts.    Relations between the two countries have generally beenwarm. But they were strained last year by the deportation of 35British nurses from the kingdom for illegal drinking and thepublication of a letter by a retired British ambassadordescribing Saudi Arabians as incompetent and arrogant.    Saudi Arabia is Britain's largest export market in theMiddle East.    Britain exported 1.5 billion stg worth of goods to SaudiArabia last year while British imports from that country in thesame period totalled 436 mln.    Trade officials will discuss what countertrade Britain canoffer in return for Riyadh giving London its biggest-ever armsexport order.

Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday:"We don't have a target for the dollar." He declined to commenton what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: "Wereally don't talk about the dollar."    He said protectionism was becoming "extremely strong" in theU.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and importbarriers in other countries.    "The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It'sextremely strong," he said.    "As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engagedhere in a real struggle to preserve the world's free tradingsystem, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.)goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same paththat the world did in the late 1930s," he said.    While relative exchange rates had a role to play indefusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offerany solution, he said.    "You must address this problem on the exchange rate side,but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It'sfar more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution ofit requires a comprehensive approach," Baker said in theinterview.

reut2-008.sgm, U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING, A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasurysupply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering creditmarket, but at least this week's offerings should provide itwith some focus, economists said.    "Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put towork, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,"said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.    The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package oftwo-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales blockthis week.    The "mini-refunding," which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs innew cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes forauction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes onWednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes onThursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- andsix-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.    The mini-refunding does not come at a particularlyauspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been driftingsideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudyU.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change inFederal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.    Moreover, the bond market's inertia has comparedunfavourably with the rash of activity taking place inhigh-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.Equities.    But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there aresigns the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting abit.    "Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,and there is a marked absence of selling," they said in a weeklyreport.    Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believesbanks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week'ssales.    "The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying thesematurities has been wider, it is still positive," he said in aweekly market review.    But economists agreed not even the auctions will generateenough impetus for a major move. This will only come once theoverseas markets have had their run.    "Based on last week's events, there is little to indicatethat the appetite for yield has begun to wane," said economistsat Salomon Brothers Inc.    Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investorsare planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of thehigher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal yearon April 1.    And while traditionally the Japanese have not been bigbuyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S.Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence.    Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadianmonetary authorities to curb the rise of their currenciesshould also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bondmarkets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said.    Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven theU.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,economists said.    This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday withFebruary durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound fromJanuary's depressed levels.    Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co saidseveral areas, including transport equipment, should havebounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will captotal new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct afterJanuary's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gainas large as five pct.    Friday's consumer price report for February is expected toshow an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind theJanuary rise -- rose more moderately last month, while foodprices declined.    Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds ratewill be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to theapproach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.    Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass thisweek because its adding requirement increases sharply in thenew statement period beginning on Thursday.    Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expectedto open near that level. REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, SWISS BANKERS PLANNING COMPROMISE ON SECRECY CURBS, Bankers, concerned about official callsfor curbs on Switzerland's banking secrecy, are likely topropose a compromise plan when they meet regulators today, theBankers Federation Secretary said.    Andreas Hubschmid confirmed a report in yesterday'sSonntagsblick the Federation would make proposals to curb theanonymity given to some bank clients who hide their identitiesbehind lawyers or fiduciary agents.    "The Sonntagsblick story goes in the right direction, and Icannot deny it," Hubschmid told Reuters.    Hubschmid declined to confirm details, saying nothing hadyet been decided.    Recent allegations U.S. Officials involved in thearms-for-Iran scandal took advantage of Swiss discretion toopen accounts here have added fuel to the long-running secrecydebate, while Manila has said former Philippine PresidentFerdinand Marcos put a fortune into banks here.    While Swiss banks are strictly forbidden to reveal thenames of their clients to the outside world, a self-governingcode of conduct dating from 1977 requires the bankersthemselves know the identities of their clients.    But the banking code, due for renewal this October, allowsa client to hide his name behind a lawyer provided the lattersigns the so-called "B-form" guaranteeing that his client is notmisusing his anonymity for criminal purposes.    The Commission said at the end of last year it wanted useof the form drastically reduced.    The bankers' compromise plan, Sonntagsblick said, quotingreliable sources, aims to eliminate abuses by differentiatingbetween lawyers who just manage portfolios for their clientsand those who do so only as a small part of a wider legalservice.    Only in the second case, would the use of the B-form stillbe allowed, it said. Other clients would have to give up theiranonymity and reveal their identities to the bank.    Commission President Hermann Bodenmann said the Commissionwas likely to discuss the proposal at today's meeting with thebankers, and during its own council session on Tuesday. Hedeclined further comment. The banks draw up their own rules of conduct. But bankinganalysts said the banks cannot afford to ignore the views ofthe Commission, which is ultimately responsible for preventingabuses. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, DEBT SOLUTION REQUIRES OPEN MARKETS, GERMAN BANKER, The solution of the world's debtcrisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence ofprotectionism is the biggest danger, the president of theFederal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.    Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of DresdnerBank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil'ssuspension last month of part of its interest payments wouldlead to a chain reaction in Latin America.    It is important to increase the efficiency of debtorcountries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency fromexports to repay foreign debt, he said.    Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, butBrazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help ofappropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bringback financial stability to that country.    Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be takennow. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able torepay debts in the short run, even if economic conditionsimproved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthenthe economic position of these countries, to ensure worldeconomic growth so they are able to sell their products atadequate prices.    Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved incoordination with governments, international organisations suchas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, andcreditor banks.    "This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banksalone," he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standingof debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raisefunds on international credit markets again. He said a wholeset of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced theinternational banking system would provide more funds, but theproblem is not just economic but also political. REUTER&#3;

He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of atwo-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progressmade by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting lastSeptember launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement onTariffs and Trade) talks.    European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercqmeanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's threemajor trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan-- set a poor example for other members of GATT.    Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reportersbilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest ofthe world was no way to solve trade disputes.    New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleaguesgreat progress had been made in preparing for the current roundof GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.    The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentumtowards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.    Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks wasthat they tended to get bogged down for years. "Countries don'tget very serious about negotiating until the end of the daywhich is, maybe, five or six years in the future."    He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress asprotectionist as it was 18 months ago. "That's a very healthydevelopment," he added."If you asked me about that a year or 18months ago I would have said that it was terriblyprotectionist."    "Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members ofCongress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answerto the 170 billion dlr trade deficit," Yeutter said.    "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislatesolutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they aremore realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on thatissue than they were 12 or 18 months ago."    He added, "Whether that will be reflected in the legislationthat eventually emerges is another matter." REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, PREMIER SAYS YUGOSLAVIA WILL PAY ITS DEBTS, Yugoslavia, whose economic crisis isunder close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not followBrazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt,Prime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying.    Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in aninterview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency.    He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and wouldcontinue to do so, but he said creditors and internationalinstitutions should show more "understanding" for Yugoslavia'ssituation.    Mikulic said Yugoslavia had "understanding" for what Brazilhad done.    Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, laggingexports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposedpartial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespreadstrikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the armycould be called in if Yugoslavia's political system wasthreatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 withhard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid arecord 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing itsoverall debt by 996 mln dlrs.    Government ministers told reporters last week theyregretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said thecost to the economy had been too great.    Earlier this month deputy prime minister JanosMilosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. ForeignMinister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, "radical changes" ininterest rates and repayment times were needed.    Western economists said Mikulic's remarks, taken with thoseof his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seenahead in financing the debt repayments.    Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be consideredby the Paris club at the end of this month.    The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewedthe Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to bealarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis hereand the possibility of balance of payments problems later thisyear.

The government has so far rejected suggestions that it letthe IMF play a role in rescheduling its 109 billion dlr debt,the biggest in the Third World.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro has said an IMF program forBrazil, adopted four years ago, caused a recession and hebelieves another IMF program would stifle growth.    Sarney last month suspended interest payments on Brazil's68 billion dlr commercial debt, a move which has found littlefavour among the country's business community.    Several businessmen called for a return to the IMF, arguingthis would give the country access to new funds and allow theeconomy to grow. Both sides in the IMF debate say the coursethey favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.    "We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does, ifnecessary going to the IMF," Mario Amato, president of the SaoPaulo State Industries' Federation, was quoted as saying.     An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically verydifficult for the Sarney government and there are no firmindications such a policy reversal is in the offing.    The person most closely associated with the anti-IMF stanceis Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, who was not present atyesterday's meeting.

Continued state subsidies wouldnot save them but would only prolong their lives artificallyfor a few years, he said.    "That is why I have refused to continue subsidising them inthe way that we have done in the past," he said.

Other constraints were capacity, 11 pct, and labour ninepct, the survey said.    Inflationary pressure increased during the quarter andinvestment plans for the next year were scaled down, which thesurvey said could limit activity in the medium to short term.    Respondents reporting an increase in orders fell to 22 pctin March from 30 pct in December, while those with ordersaccepted but not yet delivered fell to 14 pct from 21 pct.    Stocks of finished goods and raw materials fell sharply inthe March quarter and further depletion was forecast for theJune quarter, the survey said.

Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGLshare if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders.    SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited.    In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it wasdenied confidential information on SGL that would be given toother potential bidders.    SGL officials could not be reached for comment.    Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for thesale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access toSGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with keyemployees.    "We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyoutfirms," said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGLmanagement may be considering a leveraged buyout.    Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on afriendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate allthe terms of its offer.    Dart said SGL representatives said the company has notreceived any other offer.    It said it requested the confidential information to betterunderstand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to signan agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL withoutSGL's approval.    The agreement would also have limited its ability to buySGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditionsunreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendlytransaction, it said.    Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.    Dart said it requested the information before its meetingwith SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hoperepresentatives would reach an agreement.    It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was toldthere were certain issues important to SGL management and whilethey were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to takethem into account in putting together its package.    It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mlndlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vicepresident James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.    Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers'severance agreements, although there was an implication thatLieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of theirown volition.    Dart said under their present agreements, none of theseofficers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management'sincentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a costof six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the sharesunless waived by the company's compensation committee.    Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for topmanagement's supplemental retirement plan.    Dart said another issue was to agree to future severanceobligations and future salary guarantees for top management,estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligationsunder the company's present policy.    Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed todiscuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try tonegotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.    Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chainand Rickels home centres.    Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filedby an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking suchactions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.    The suit also sought to have directors carry out theirfiduciary duty.    Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by anunwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue ofsecurities to shareholders which make a takeover moreexpensive. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES, The government'sover-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affectingAustralia's economic performance, Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.    Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income isderived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weakcrude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.    This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts thecountry's economic performance directly by acting as adisincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affectingtrading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.    Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiencyposition is posing a major economic threat, yet thegovernment's response has been to load new tax burdens on theoil industry, Benbow said.    Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected tofall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of theBass Strait fields, he said.    Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with thethree largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.    By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just overhalf the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undevelopedfields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery fromexisting fields goes ahead, Benbow said.    Government projections of output from as yet undiscoveredfields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.    Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying acrude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five yearstime, he said.    At present world oil prices and the current value of theAustralian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would costbetween 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.    Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, theaddition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.    For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the fiveyears 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.    He called on the government to review its tax policies torestore incentive to exploration. REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, BAKER WARNS AGAINST FORGIVENESS OF LATIN DEBT, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker saidany attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major LatinAmerican debtor nations might damage the world economy.    In an article in Monday's edition of the Miami Herald,Baker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief,calling it a "dramatic, overnight solution."    "While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have somepolitical appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive inthe long run," he said.    The article was published to coincide with a three-daymeeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).    Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on ThirdWorld debt.    Brazil, the Third World's largest debtor, last monthdeclared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given noindication of when it may resume interest payments, promptingfears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantialdebt writedowns and calling into question the viability of theU.S. Strategy.    Baker, defending the strategy, said private commercialbanks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt sinceOctober 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.    "Together with expected progress in commercial bankdiscussions with Argentina and, we hope, Brazil, this shouldadd up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtorsin 1987," Baker wrote.    He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accountedfor 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region's majordebtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sellThird World debt at a discount to investors who then becomestockholders in firms in these countries. "These swaps aren't apanacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market canmake progress in reducing the debt burden," he said. REUTER&#3;

Gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his firstmeeting with Brazil's bank advisory committee since he wasappointed last month, also promised a clear statement ofBrazil's economic policy would be made in the next few days.    But bankers who attended the meeting with Gros said it wasinconclusive.    The bankers also expressed disappointment Gros could notgive assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billiondlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.    "It was all very tentative. You can't expect to get very farat the first meeting," one banker said.    The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meetinghere of the Inter-American Development Bank.    The most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need fora legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbankcredit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at theend of March.    Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enoughcredit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needsto request a formal extension of the commitments to head offpossible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.    The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee willendorse Brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide orsimply relay it without comment.    This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday'smeeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitablelanguage for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.    Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-dayrollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originallymatured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15.Bankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money issubject to the moratorium.    Once interest on Brazil's debts becomes more than 90 daysoverdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans onnon-performing basis and may book payments only as and whenthey are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.    Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarterwould be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis.Other U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.    Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible andsaid he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see ifthere was a way round the problem.    He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loanmight be arranged to pay the interest, he said, "It couldhappen."    Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at thecommittee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent withBrazil's determination to find a long-term solution to theproblem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.    Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at atime is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loanscan it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.    "If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can'tmeet all its obligations," he said.    Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, notinginflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and thepublic sector budget was in operational surplus.    But he said there was a need to spell out governmentpolicy, especially on prices.    "It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and externalreasons," he said, but declined to say what economic measuresmight be introduced.    Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with thebanks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoedby the country's creditors. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, IADB DISPUTE HIGHLIGHTS LATIN DEBT CONFLICTS, Controversy surrounding U.S.-backedreforms in the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)underscores the mounting challenge to Washington's current debtstrategy, according to Latin American officials and delegatesto the IADB meeting that begins here today.    The bank's policy-making board on Saturday postponed adecision on the reforms until June in view of strong LatinAmerican opposition to U.S. Proposals to strengthen its controlover lending to the region.    Washington wants to involve the IADB in its debt strategythrough increased lending, but as the bank's largest singleshareholder it also wants to require countries to adoptfar-reaching economic reforms to qualify for loans.    The U.S. Push for IADB reforms, which began at last year'smeeting in Costa Rica, is particularly sensitive in aninstitution Latin Americans have traditionally thought of astheir own.    "It's almost an issue of sovereignty for the LatinAmericans," one IADB official said.    With a 54.2 per cent voting bloc, Latin American nationshave had relatively easy access to 35 billion dlrs in projectloans since the bank's founding in 1959.    The bank has also been run for the past 12 years by aMexican, Antonio Ortiz Mena, who has been increasingly criticalof U.S. Debt strategy in the last two years.    Ortiz Mena says commercial banks must renew lending to theregion if debtors are to grow and repay creditors. At a newsconference last week he warned that Latin defaults were adistinct possibility in the long run.    Brazil insists its debt service obligations should in noway interfere with growth priorities, a position putting theissue of debt relief squarely into focus for the first time,officials and delegates said.    They said creditors are not ready to discuss debtforgiveness and prefer to look at schemes such as debt-equityswaps in combination with a continuing emphasis on economicreforms.    Washington wants the IADB to impose greater conditions onlending, and has threatened to block increased appropriationsfor the bank if it does not get its way.    Latin America, while retaining reservations, now acceptsthe principle of setting greater conditions on loans, but isunwilling to countenance U.S. Demands for greater veto powerson lending, officials and delegates said.    Washington has pushed for veto power to be lowered to 35pct from a simple majority as at present. Latin Americans areunwilling to go below 40 pct, which would oblige the U.S. Toline up two other voters or voting blocs on its side.    This attempt to weaken Latin America's voting power, andparticularly a threat by Washington to reduce funds to the IADBunless its reforms are accepted, has created considerableresentment among Latin Americans.    "Debtors have already shown considerable willingness tosacrifice over the last five years so economic adjustment isnot at issue," one Latin American official said.    The region has been hoping for a seventh replenishment ofIADB resources of at least 20 billion dlrs for 1987-90, asagainst 15.7 billion for the previous four-year period. REUTER&#3;

Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulkof world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in aspeech prepared for delivery to the Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) annual conference.    It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewherewill not change this fact, he said.    McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields containabout 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.    Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside theMiddle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in thelast 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.    He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at therate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.    More than half of remaining proved reserves are in theMiddle East, he said.    McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oiloutside the Middle East because each addition contributes to adiversity of supply desirable for global political and economicstability.    "It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-countrydiscoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stabletaxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up ofacreage for exploration," he said.    Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost theincentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources ofpetroleum, he added. REUTER&#3;

The officials said the move could lead to the collapse ofthe opposition coalition between the Liberal and Nationalparties, which has been under severe strain in recent weeks.    In a television interview yesterday prime minister BobHawke said he might call an early election if strife within theopposition undermined business confidence and hurt Australia'seconomic recovery.    "The opposition have not only destabilised themselves, theyhave prostituted the political and economic debate by puttingup economic nostrums and stupidities that are destabilizingbusiness confidence," Hawke said.    Howard relegated Peacock to the back benches after theMelbourne Sun published an alleged telephone conversationbetween Peacock and another opposition member in which Peacockwas critical of Howard's leadership.

Peacock told reporters he accepted Howard's right to "hireand fire." He refused to answer questions about any leadershipchallenge.

reut2-008.sgm, AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT, A 10 percentagepoint reduction in the Australian government's maximum crudeoil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output,resources analyst Ian Story said here.    A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Straitoutput to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrelsper day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum ExplorationAssociation annual conference.    Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydneystockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.    Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longerappropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.    The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discoveredbefore September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty CoLtd &lt;BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp &lt;XON> partnership to shut-inproduction, accelerating the decline in output and reducinggovernment revenue, he said.    He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrsif the levy was cut to 70 pct.    "The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractiveat oil prices below 30 dlrs," Story said.    Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higherlevels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boostexports and provide incentives for exploration and development,he said.

He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) meeting the widening gap between developed anddeveloping countries and an inequitable international economicsystem were major impediments to growth in developingcountries.    Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks inthe New Zealand resort of Taupo.    "I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of theexternal indebtedness of African countries reflects the fulleffect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of thedeveloped market economy countries," Mamman said.    "The developed market economy countries have slowed downoutput growth thereby drying up markets for the commodityexports of African countries."    Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs ayear would be needed over the next five years for the Africancontinent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth(GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990.    Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.    "With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three tofour pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debtpersists," Mamman said. Developed countries must seekalternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer ofresources and more indebtedness, he said.

And act quickly to stabilize demand and pricesof our commodity exports," he added. REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, VW EXPECTS HIGHER GERMAN MARKET SHARE IN 1987, Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>expects to increase its market share in West Germany in thefull year 1987 after registering gains in the first two monthsof the year, managing board chairman Carl Hahn said.    He told Reuters in an interview that incoming orders inWest Germany, VW's largest single market, had been very good inearly 1987. Its share of the domestic car market rose to 29 pctin January and February from 26 pct in the year-ago period.    Hahn declined to forecast first quarter 1987 results, oranswer questions about the VW currency scandal.    Hahn said he did not want to elaborate on statements VW hadalready issued on the affair and noted the case was now in thehands of state prosecutors.    VW, like other car manufacturers, had encountered difficultmarket conditions in the United States in early 1987, Hahnsaid, without giving details.    He declined to predict U.S. Sales for 1987 as a whole,saying it was particularly difficult this year to forecastsales trends in North America, VW's second largest regionalmarket after Western Europe.    Hahn declined to comment directly on reports that 1986losses at Spanish subsidiary Sociedad Espanola de Automovilesde Turismo (SEAT) totalled up to 27 billion pesetas or thatthese losses were twice as high as expected.    But he said SEAT was developing according to plan and addedthe introduction of international accounting standards andchanges to VW's own had led to some corrections to SEAT'sfigures.    VW hoped SEAT would reach break-even point in the course ofthis year. In 1986 SEAT's volume sales had been better thanexpected, Hahn said.    In January and February, 1987, SEAT's turnover in Europerose 40 pct compared with the same months of 1986, Hahn said.Its European market share rose to 1.9 pct in January andFebruary from 1.6 pct a year earlier.    Hahn said VW hoped to sign a contract with Ford Motor Co&lt;F.N> in the summer on the planned joint venture between thetwo companies' loss-making operations in Argentina and Brazil.    A provisional joint management team was already looking atways of synchronising the two operations, he said. VW'soperations in Mexico had made again made a profit in 1986, headded.    Hahn, speaking to Reuters in an interview to markproduction of VW's 50 millionth car, said VW had no plans tomake acquisitions outside the automotive sector.    It also did not expect to raise capital again in theforeseeable future after increasing capital by 25 pct in 1986in the biggest rights issue in West German history, Hahn said.    In a separate interview Karl-Heinz Briam, the managementboard member responsible for labour relations, said VW did notcurrently plan to increase its workforce further this year.    All of VW's domestic plants and most of its foreignproduction facilities were currently operating at fullcapacity, Briam said. The exceptions were VW's Nigerianoperations and its Westmoreland plant in Pennsylvania.    Hahn said VW had recently taken steps to increase theflexibility and improve the structure of the Westmorelandplant. However, VW was not planning to increase productionthere at the moment.    "Most of the VW vehicles (sold in the U.S.) will, as before,be built in Germany," Hahn said.    Hahn said there was room for further growth in WestGermany, and predicted that 1987 would be a good year generallyfor the industry domestically.    Wolfgang Lincke, head of car development at VW, said theincreasing environmental awareness of West German consumerswould allow VW to sell more "higher value" cars in futurecontaining equipment such as catalytic converters, which cutexhaust emissions.    Lincke declined to be drawn on when VW may introduce asuccessor to its current Golf model, which in 1983 replaced theoriginal dating from 1974.    VW would in any case retain the Golf name. Of the 50 mln VWcars built since VW started commercial production after WorldWar II, nearly nine mln have been Golfs, Lincke said.    VW, which traditionally releases its annual results inApril or May, said last week 1986 profit and dividend wouldboth be unchanged despite the need to make provision to coverthe possible loss of 480 mln marks from allegedly fraudulenthedging operations.    VW has also said the currency scandal would not affect thecompany's investment spending. REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM , West German bond yields could declineover the next few months if recent efforts to stabilizeexchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend tokeeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.    But in the longer term domestic yields could rise underagreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said.    The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilizedcurrencies with the threat of central bank intervention,economists said.    Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolsterthe pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest ratesfurther when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April."The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbankand the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rateare significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.and foreign interest rates," Salomon Bros Inc said in a recentstudy.    It said narrowing of international interest rate spreadswas a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads willhave to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.    West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouragedthe U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when theBundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoidweakening the dollar.    West German economists see room for further cuts in leadingWest German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.    "It's not a taboo," Peter Pietsch, spokesman for CommerzbankAG said.    But most economists see room for a cut in West German ratesonly in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflationwill limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.    The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is alreadynearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April. Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors toshift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a movewould tend to flatten the yield curve between short andlong-term rates, which has become more pronounced since theBundesbank lowered its discount rate.    It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, asthe shift out of savings accounts into securities would slowgrowth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.    But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase WestGerman tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed tomeet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move mayforce interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which mustbe filled by higher government borrowing.    This may not occur if private sector demand for creditremains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.    Economists said it appeared the government had alreadystepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss fromother sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker thanexpected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.    Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West GermanIfo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by theWest German government in November.    Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.But coupled with other factors such as waning foreignspeculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, longterm yields may to have to rise, economists said.    Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing toincreases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.    The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.    West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increasedborrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday hewas looking for other ways to finance the reform, such asraising indirect taxes.    But few economists believe the government will be able togo through with its tax measures without increasing netborrowing.    The Bundesbank said in its February report that it waswrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986could be managed without increasing deficits.    The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borroweda large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 finalquarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.    The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks ofthe fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billionmarks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when ithad not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.

In Tokyo, incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by theLDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support thesales tax as it stands.

reut2-008.sgm, BEGHIN-SAY SEES SOLUTION TO EC SUGAR DISPUTE, A settlement could soon be reached in thedispute between European sugar producers and the EuropeanCommunity over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes,president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leadingthe protest, told journalists today.    "Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few daysindicate that we are moving towards a solution," he said, addingthat if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.    Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes ofsugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC'spolicy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failedto give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtainby offering sugar into EC intervention.    At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparentconcession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 Europeancurrency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producerssay is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate whichwas 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.    Vernes would not say what form any compromise between theproducers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed thelong-term desire of producers to export to the world market,providing they were not losing money by doing so.    Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, orat any time over the following five weeks before the officialpayment date.    The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internalmarket if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, AUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA TO FALL, FORECASTER SAYS, Australian wheat plantings areforecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF)said in its first preliminary crop forecast.    But there was no reason to expect Australian production in1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year,the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales andQueensland suffered from poor yields last season.    Most of the fall in plantings was expected in WesternAustralia while state average yields would be assisted bygrowers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.    The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was apoor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. Butin the eastern states the wheat area should hold up providedthat rainfall between now and June is not less than average,AWF said.    Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut backwheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since theyneeded cash flow and there were problems with alternativecrops.    "The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses andoats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise ahigh proportion of growers' income," AWF said.

reut2-008.sgm, DEBT SOLUTION REQUIRES OPEN MARKETS, GERMAN BANKER, The solution of the world's debtcrisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence ofprotectionism is the biggest danger, the president of theFederal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.    Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of DresdnerBank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil'ssuspension last month of part of its interest payments wouldlead to a chain reaction in Latin America.    It is important to increase the efficiency of debtorcountries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency fromexports to repay foreign debt, he said.    Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, butBrazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help ofappropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bringback financial stability to that country.    Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be takennow. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able torepay debts in the short run, even if economic conditionsimproved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthenthe economic position of these countries, to ensure worldeconomic growth so they are able to sell their products atadequate prices.    Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved incoordination with governments, international organisations suchas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, andcreditor banks.    "This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banksalone," he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standingof debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raisefunds on international credit markets again. He said a wholeset of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced theinternational banking system would provide more funds, but theproblem is not just economic but also political. REUTER&#3;

It said its February survey showed firms were alsoincreasingly pessimistic about the outlook for the comingmonths, causing them to cut back production plans.    IFO blamed the worsening of the business climate andoutlook largely on expectations of further declines in foreigndemand.    More than a quarter of the firms polled said they thoughtorders in hand were insufficient.    Overall, the business climate in February could bedescribed as just short of satisfactory, IFO said.    In a breakdown of responses by industrial sector, theinstitute said manufacturers of basic products judged thebusiness climate to be slightly less favourable in Februarythan in January. For the coming months they expect exportprospects to dim and production to fall, it added.    Chemical firms reported a slight improvement in demand butthey increasingly said orders on hand were insufficient.    The business climate in the capital goods industry wasunchanged in February compared with January, but IFO said thiswas due entirely to positive reports from makers of commercialvehicles.    Demand in the capital goods sector was generally describedas weak, with the outlook in February cloudier than it had beenin January, the institute said.    The business climate in the consumer durables sectorremained above the industry average in February. Carmakers wereagain positive about current business but forecast a slightworsening of business conditions in the near future.    In the consumer goods industry business conditions weredescribed as favourable in February.

He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of atwo-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progressmade by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting lastSeptember launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement onTariffs and Trade) talks.    European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercqmeanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's threemajor trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan-- set a poor example for other members of GATT.    Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reportersbilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest ofthe world was no way to solve trade disputes.    New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleaguesgreat progress had been made in preparing for the current roundof GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked.    The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentumtowards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts.    Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks wasthat they tended to get bogged down for years. "Countries don'tget very serious about negotiating until the end of the daywhich is, maybe, five or six years in the future."    He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress asprotectionist as it was 18 months ago. "That's a very healthydevelopment," he added."If you asked me about that a year or 18months ago I would have said that it was terriblyprotectionist."    "Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members ofCongress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answerto the 170 billion dlr trade deficit," Yeutter said.    "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislatesolutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they aremore realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on thatissue than they were 12 or 18 months ago."    He added, "Whether that will be reflected in the legislationthat eventually emerges is another matter." REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, PREMIER SAYS YUGOSLAVIA WILL PAY ITS DEBTS, Yugoslavia, whose economic crisis isunder close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not followBrazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt,Prime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying.    Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in aninterview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency.    He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and wouldcontinue to do so, but he said creditors and internationalinstitutions should show more "understanding" for Yugoslavia'ssituation.    Mikulic said Yugoslavia had "understanding" for what Brazilhad done.    Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, laggingexports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposedpartial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespreadstrikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the armycould be called in if Yugoslavia's political system wasthreatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 withhard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid arecord 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing itsoverall debt by 996 mln dlrs.    Government ministers told reporters last week theyregretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said thecost to the economy had been too great.    Earlier this month deputy prime minister JanosMilosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. ForeignMinister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, "radical changes" ininterest rates and repayment times were needed.    Western economists said Mikulic's remarks, taken with thoseof his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seenahead in financing the debt repayments.    Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be consideredby the Paris club at the end of this month.    The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewedthe Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to bealarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis hereand the possibility of balance of payments problems later thisyear.    Mikulic visits West Germany next week, and debt is expectedto figure high on the agenda of his talks with ChancellorHelmut Kohl. REUTER&#3;

Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a ForeignMinistry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference wouldbe met by "a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in theworld."     U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarksapparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would dowhatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the faceof new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.    The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had beentold of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed athreat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.    U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-madeanti-ship "Silkworm" missiles, which pose a greater threat tomerchant ships than missiles used before.    The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intendedto attack ships were "misleading propaganda."    He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main causeof tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use "allits legitimate means to stem the cause of tension."

Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday:"We don't have a target for the dollar." He declined to commenton what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: "Wereally don't talk about the dollar."    He said protectionism was becoming "extremely strong" in theU.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and importbarriers in other countries.    "The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It'sextremely strong," he said.    "As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engagedhere in a real struggle to preserve the world's free tradingsystem, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.)goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same paththat the world did in the late 1930s," he said.    While relative exchange rates had a role to play indefusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offerany solution, he said.    "You must address this problem on the exchange rate side,but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It'sfar more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution ofit requires a comprehensive approach," Baker said in theinterview.

The government has so far rejected suggestions that it letthe IMF play a role in rescheduling its 109 billion dlr debt,the biggest in the Third World.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro has said an IMF program forBrazil, adopted four years ago, caused a recession and hebelieves another IMF program would stifle growth.    Sarney last month suspended interest payments on Brazil's68 billion dlr commercial debt, a move which has found littlefavour among the country's business community.    Several businessmen called for a return to the IMF, arguingthis would give the country access to new funds and allow theeconomy to grow. Both sides in the IMF debate say the coursethey favour will enable Brazil to avoid recession.    "We have to discuss the foreign debt like Mexico does, ifnecessary going to the IMF," Mario Amato, president of the SaoPaulo State Industries' Federation, was quoted as saying.     An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically verydifficult for the Sarney government and there are no firmindications such a policy reversal is in the offing.    The person most closely associated with the anti-IMF stanceis Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, who was not present atyesterday's meeting.

reut2-008.sgm, BAKER WARNS AGAINST FORGIVENESS OF LATIN DEBT, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker saidany attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major LatinAmerican debtor nations might damage the world economy.    In an article in Monday's edition of the Miami Herald,Baker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief,calling it a "dramatic, overnight solution."    "While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have somepolitical appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive inthe long run," he said.    The article was published to coincide with a three-daymeeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).    Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on ThirdWorld debt.    Brazil, the Third World's largest debtor, last monthdeclared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given noindication of when it may resume interest payments, promptingfears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantialdebt writedowns and calling into question the viability of theU.S. Strategy.    Baker, defending the strategy, said private commercialbanks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt sinceOctober 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.    "Together with expected progress in commercial bankdiscussions with Argentina and, we hope, Brazil, this shouldadd up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtorsin 1987," Baker wrote.    He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accountedfor 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region's majordebtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sellThird World debt at a discount to investors who then becomestockholders in firms in these countries. "These swaps aren't apanacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market canmake progress in reducing the debt burden," he said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, BRAZIL SEEKS TO REASSURE BANKS ON DEBT SUSPENSION, Brazil wants to resume interest paymentson its medium- and long-term foreign debt as soon as possibleand is willing to discuss ways of softening the impact of thepayments suspension on bank earnings, central bank governorFrancisco Gros said.    Gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his firstmeeting with Brazil's bank advisory committee since he wasappointed last month, also promised a clear statement ofBrazil's economic policy would be made in the next few days.    But bankers who attended the meeting with Gros said it wasinconclusive.    The bankers also expressed disappointment Gros could notgive assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billiondlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.    "It was all very tentative. You can't expect to get very farat the first meeting," one banker said.    The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meetinghere of the Inter-American Development Bank.    The most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need fora legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbankcredit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at theend of March.    Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enoughcredit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needsto request a formal extension of the commitments to head offpossible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.    The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee willendorse Brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide orsimply relay it without comment.    This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday'smeeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitablelanguage for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.    Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-dayrollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originallymatured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15.Bankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money issubject to the moratorium.    Once interest on Brazil's debts becomes more than 90 daysoverdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans onnon-performing basis and may book payments only as and whenthey are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.    Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarterwould be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis.Other U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.    Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible andsaid he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see ifthere was a way round the problem.    He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loanmight be arranged to pay the interest, he said, "It couldhappen."    Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at thecommittee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent withBrazil's determination to find a long-term solution to theproblem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.    Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at atime is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loanscan it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.    "If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can'tmeet all its obligations," he said.    Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, notinginflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and thepublic sector budget was in operational surplus.    But he said there was a need to spell out governmentpolicy, especially on prices.    "It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and externalreasons," he said, but declined to say what economic measuresmight be introduced.    Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with thebanks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoedby the country's creditors. REUTER&#3;

Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at awelcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that greatprogress had been made in preparing for the negotiations whichmust not be sidetracked.    "We live in troubled and dangerous times for the worldtrading system," he said.    "We have seen that the failure of the world trading systemhas caused great depression and conflict in the past. Ourfailure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to usall," Moore said.   "The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our lasthope and best opportunity this century. We will not get anotherchance before the year 2000," he added.    The ministers are in New Zealand to review world tradesince the "Uruguay round" talks last September. The talks are also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice.    The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to havebeen particularly successful, with northern hemispherecountries managing to have service industries such as bankingand insurance included in the next full round.    The southerners' goal of including agricultural andtropical products also was met.    The meeting at this North Island tourist resort isdescribed by participants as informal and no declaration isexpected.    Moore said one aim was to "instil a sense of politicalurgency to avert potential economic tragedy."

reut2-008.sgm, CASH CRISIS HITS UGANDAN COFFEE BOARD, Uganda's state-run Coffee MarketingBoard (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past twomonths due to a bottleneck in export shipments andadministrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.    The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (theequivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers andprocessors for coffee already delivered, but its present exportrevenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.    The board's cash crisis has serious implications for theeconomy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct ofUganda's total exports.    The CMB's financial difficulties first started in Januaryfollowing delays in rail-freighting export consignments ofcoffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.    These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons inUganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandanwagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan andTanzanian railway systems, the sources said    Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publiclyacknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears tolocal suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport formoving exports.    Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeezewould be resolved in two weeks.    However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies betweenthe Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it outof action between February 21 and March 15, causing freshdelays in cargo movements.    Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruptionof rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has bannedtheir haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.    Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMBwas holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.    These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda'sexpected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September)crop, the sources said.    According to the sources, the board's financial problemshave been aggravated by long delays in processing exportreceipts.    The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycleexport receipts into payments to local producers, whereasexport bills handled by local banks took half that time toprocess, they said.    The sources said the CMB's price structure had beenovertaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficiallyestimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a furtherdisincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.    "The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three monthsbehind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and thesooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, thebetter for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole," oneof the sources said.    The government is currently negotiating a package ofeconomic reforms with the World Bank and International MonetaryFund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid tohelp Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of politicalstrife.

reut2-008.sgm, U.S. ECONOMIST CALLS BRAZIL DEBT REQUEST MODEST, Brazil's attempt to seek betterterms for paying off its 109 billion dlr foreign debt isresponsible and modest, a former chairman of President Reagan'sCouncil of Economic Advisers said.    "I think that what Brazil is calling for -- limiting itsdebt payments to two and one half pct of GNP -- is aresponsible request on their part," economist Martin Feldsteinsaid at a weekend news conference.    "It requires additional money on the part of the banks, butrather modest additional amounts."    Feldstein is attending the annual meeting of the TrilateralCommission, a foreign policy group of more than 300 businessand government leaders from North America, Europe and Japan.    Feldstein, one of four members of a task force on ThirdWorld debt, said that Brazil's request would mean an additionalcredit of three billion to four billion dlrs from banks andinternational agencies.    "Brazil's debt would increase in dollar terms but remainconstant in real terms. The four billion dlr increase inBrazil's 100 billion dlr debt would represent no increase inthe real inflation-adjusted size of its liability," he said.    Feldstein said he believed current Third World debtproblems were less serious than those faced by theinternational monetary system in 1983 and 1985.    However, the European representative on the task force,Herve de Carmoy, chief executive international for Midland BankPLC, disagreed.    He called the present situation more difficult and, in adraft proposal included in the task force's report, suggestedsetting up an institution, possibly within the World Bank, witha fund that could deal with a future debt crisis.    Commission discussions were closed to reporters but it wasapparent from the news conference that task force members didnot agree on all points in their report.    One point of agreement, Feldstein said, was that debtorcountries would need additional credit in the coming years ifthey are to enjoy satisfactory growth.    Feldstein said the task force, which also included KoeiNarusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank ofToyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on howmuch credit would be needed.    He said they also did not reach a consensus on how willinginternational banks, particularly those in Japan and Europe,would be to lend the money.    The Trilateral Commission was set up in 1973 by DavidRockefeller, former head of Chase Manhattan bank, and others topromote closer cooperation among the three regions. Reuter&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, U.S., LATIN NATIONS DELAY DECISION ON IADB, The United States and major LatinAmerican nations agreed to set aside sharp differences overcontrol of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) andreconsider the issue this summer.    The bank's policy-making board of governors, meeting hereahead of this week's IADB annual meetings, put off anydecisions when it became apparent differences betweenWashington and the Latin countries ware too great.    IADB officials said Washington had indicated, however, itmight be prepared to compromise in the future.    The United States is the principal donor nation and haspressed the bank, controlled by the Latin American borrowingnations, to cede virtual veto power over loans to Washington.    The Reagan administration wants to make the bank part ofits controversial strategy to resolve the debt crisis.    The U.S. Plan calls for loans from multilateral banks likethe IADB to be tied to economic reforms in debtor nations whichwould promote open markets, reduced government intervention andinflation-free economic growth.    Brazil, which declared an interest payments moratorium lastmonth, is leading a challenge to Washington's strategy andofficials here obviously feared any decisions that might deepenrifts between the United States and Third World nations.    IADB officials also said Washington hinted at futurecompromise. "The U.S. Said it remains hopeful they can reach anagreement and expressed optimism that such a consensus could bereached," said an official who asked not to be named.    Washington has threatened to scuttle a 20-25 billion dlr,four-year capital replenishment for the bank if the veto issueis not resolved.    But it has asked Congress to give it authority to financeits one-third share in the event agreement on voting power isreached. The United States controls 34.5 pct of the vote andwants a loan veto to exist at the 35 pct level.    Currently, a simple majority can approve or disapproveloans giving the borrowing nations control of the purse stringsand resulting in loan conditions too lax for Washington'staste.    The U.S. Strategy for dealing with the debt crisis isexpected to be repeated by Treasury Secretary James Baker in aspeech to the bank's annual meeting today (Monday).    But monetary sources expect Baker to suggest the UnitedStates has some room for compromise and also to fend off otherchallenges to its strategy by signalling Washington is open toinnovative solutions to the debt problem. Reuter&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, BAKER EXPECTED TO DEFEND DEBT STRATEGY, Treasury Secretary James Baker, facingthe toughest challenge to his Third World debt plan so far, isexpected today to stoutly defend the strategy.     At an opening address to the annual meeting of theInter-American Development Bank here Baker is likely once againto bluntly reject alternative approaches like wholesale debtrelief.     The speech comes after Washington delayed its bid to wrestcontrol of IADB lending from Latin nations.     The Treasury Secretary is also expected, U.S. officialssay, to portray that attempt as a crucial element in his planto promote inflation-free economic growth, open markets, and amuch-reduced government role in the economies of Latin America.     "We have already seen substantial progress," Baker said ina Miami Herald article and argued the plan was never meant tobe a "quick fix".     But Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Nicaragua and Bolivia have allceased servicing some or all of their debt. Brazil's interestpayments moratorium, announced last month, is being seen as amajor challenge to the Baker plan.     Owing foreigners 109 billion dlrs, Brazil called anindefinite interest payments moratorium on 68 billion dlrs ofcommercial bank debt.     Brazilian Central Banker Francisco Gros met bankers lastnight to begin what U.S. officials predict will be months ofextremely tough negotiations.     The scale of the problem is immense. Owing some 382billion dlrs of foreign debt, Latin nations have since thestart of the decade paid out some  200 billion dlrs in interestand principal and received about 28 billion dlrs in new loans.     In addition, upwards of 100 billion dlrs in capital flightis estimated to have left the region during that time.     The Baker plan, unveiled in October, 1985, calls oncommercial and multilateral banks to increase lending by about29 billion dlrs in the three subsequent years to the 15 majordebtors engaging in fundamental economic reform.     The theory runs that once a debtor nation has reformed itseconomy, it can service its debt comfortably and without anatmosphere of crisis.     U.S. officials emphasize some 8.5 billion dlrs has beenpaid out in the first 14 months of the plan, payments of over70 billion dlrs of debt has been stretched out into the future and Washington  is embracing new and innovative ideas to keepdebtor-creditor negotiations afloat.     Baker is expected to underscore these points in hisaddress today. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, WORLD DEPENDENCY ON MIDEAST OIL SAID INEVITABLE, The world's dependency on the Mideastas the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is goingto stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp &lt;XON> Director andsenior vice president told Reuters in an interview.    "Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gapbetween demand and supply will widen so that the trend toincreasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East isinevitable," McIvor said.    Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but arenot likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.    McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oiland gas exploration and production said that dependence wouldresult from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time whenthe rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.    "Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of onlyabout 10-15 bilion barrels per year," McIvor said.    "The bulk of the inventory and more than half of theremaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which isproducing at much less than current capacity," he added.    McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discoveredso far only 37 "one-one thousandth of the total number containedabout 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered."    McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did notbelieve there were any more "super giants", or oil fields withreserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found whichwould change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.    "Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the MiddleEast. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20years and only two of these lie outside the middle east(Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope)." McIvor said.    McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S.like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching apeak and would soon begin to decline.    But the Exxon executive said that there were still plentyof opportunities to be explored and developed outside of theMiddle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, andAustralia and Africa.    McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in thoseareas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higherprice of oil as well as the legal regime affecting thecompanies.    "The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is aconstant change in policies," McIvor said.    McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used toincrease exploration as these only benefit one part of theeconomy at the expense of other parts of the economy.    Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. EnergySecretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said hecould not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowancenow but "the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It hashighlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and theneed to increase U.S. production."    McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play agreater role in the future in meeting energy needs.    "Natural gas will have the opportunity to become anincreasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply,"McIvor said.    "Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportationfuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as anindustrial fuel," he added. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, NIGERIA OPENS TALKS WITH U.K. TO RESCHEDULE DEBT, Representatives from Nigeria are meetingtoday and tomorrow with officials of Britain's Export CreditsGuarantee Department (ECGD) in the first of what could be aseries of bilateral talks to reschedule Nigeria's officialdebts, banking sources said.    The talks follow an agreement reached between Nigeria andthe Paris Club of western creditor governments in December toreschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of medium and long-term debtdue between September, 1986 and end 1987 over 10 years withfive years grace. Nigeria's official debts to the U.K., Itsmajor trading partner, are estimated at 2.5 to three billiondlrs.    If the talks prove successful, the Nigerian team, headed byFinance Minister Che Okongwu and Central Bank GovernorAbdulkadir Ahmed, will hold similar talks with French exportcredit officials in Paris later this week, the sources said.    An agreement could pave the way for ECGD to resumeinsurance cover for exports to Nigeria, which was suspended in1983.    The rescheduling of Nigeria's official debts was one of thedemands required under a rescheduling of part of the country'sestimated 19 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, for whichagreement also was reached in December between Nigeria and asteering committee representing the commercial banks.    The commercial bank rescheduling has yet to be finalisedbecause of the reluctance of Japanese banks to participate inthe agreement, despite a recent trip to Japan by seniorNigerian officials and representatives of the steeringcommittee.    The entire package also is being held up because of theneed to reach an agreement to satisfy arrears due on short-terminsured and uninsured debts. However, bankers are hopeful thatan accord will be struck by May 31.    The Nigerians also are attempting to reconcile creditors'claims with their own receipts on some two billion dlrs ofletters of credit contained in the commercial bankrescheduling.    Bankers said that it was hoped that the ECGD would resumecover fairly soon as this could encourage other officialcreditors to begin bi-lateral talks as well.    Under the structural adjustment program supporting the debtreschedulings Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in freshexport credits this year from official export credit agencies.    British exports to Nigeria were 565 mln stg in 1986, downfrom 960 mln in 1985, while Nigeria's exports to Britain, whichdo not include oil, were 328 mln stg and 647 mln, respectively. REUTER&#3;

Valerio earlier told reporters that the tiny territorywould be returned to Chinese rule on December 20, 1999, butgave no further details.    A statement issued today did not give details of theagreement as earlier expected.    "We are very happy with the results," Valerio said after fourdays of negotiations in the Chinese capital.    The talks were the fourth in a series on the Macao questionand had been expected to focus on the status of the 40,000Portuguese passport-holders among Macao's 400,000 residents.    Asked if the issue of nationality after the Chinesetakeover had been a problem in the talks, Valerio replied: "Itwas one of them."    China traditionally opposes granting dual nationality toits citizens and requires holders of foreign passports to giveup their Chinese citizenship.    In Taipei, Taiwan said it would not recognise theagreement. A Foreign Ministry statement said: "We regard theagreement on the Macao issue as null and void."    It said: "Macao should be returned to the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan because communist China, a rebel entity, has no rightto represent China and all the Chinese people.

reut2-008.sgm, JAPAN IN LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE CHIP PACT, Japan has launched a last-ditch effort tosalvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States -sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out itscase and instructing its producers to cut output further.    "We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,"Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) DeputyDirector General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.    "If hasty action is taken in the United States, it willcreate very serious problems."    The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected tomeet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateralagreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreedto stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and toincrease its imports of American semiconductors.    Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal byselling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boostAmerican imports, and has threatened to take retaliatoryaction.    In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanesechip makers to limit production in the hope that will boostdomestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.    Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobitdynamic random access and erasable programmable read onlymemory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows acutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of theyear.    He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply ofchips available for export through unregulated distributors inthe so-called grey market.    "We have almost no grey market," he said. "Supply isdiminishing."    To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITIcalled in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker,NEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuingspecific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiaryof &lt;Texas Instruments Inc>.    Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out thesteps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed forU.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.    The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State GeorgeSchultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce SecretaryMalcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.    The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, areexpected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip makerMicron Technology Inc &lt;DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales inHong Kong.    Yamamoto admitted that &lt;Oki Electric Industry Co>'s HongKong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level butdenied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.    "If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...Wewill present our rebuttal," he said.    The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI'sadvice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well aboveproduction costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.    He also called the case "strange," but he stopped short ofendorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had beentrapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micronpublicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same daythey were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person whohad bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's AgricultureDevelopment Department, told reporters prospects were good forattaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the presentgrowing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.    Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnesa year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the "belg"(small) rains which fall at this time of year.    The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops likemaize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affectsproduction in the main rainy season, because farmers eat theirstocks of seed.    Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regionswhich suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sowtheir crops because of the favourable rains.    The government had distributed large quantities of seed andfertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, IADB PLANS TO MATCH 1986 LENDING LEVEL, The Inter-American Development Banksaid it intended this year to match the over three billion dlrsit lent to Latin America in 1986, despite growing pressures onits capital.    In its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, theBank made it clear, however, that the Latin countries neededvast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen theirailing economies in the period ahead. The report said LatinAmerica continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession thatbegan in the early 1980s, with Gross Domestic Product edging upto nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.    The report said the region's improved economic growth lastyear was based on a rise in internal demand and fullerutilization previously underused production capacity.    "This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 andbeyond because no significant new investments are being made,"the report said.    The Bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to35.44 billion dlrs.    Of last year's loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actuallydisbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.    To assist in loan activities, the Bank said it borrowed1.91 billion dlrs in the capital markets in 1986, bringing itstotal outstanding borrowings to 12.11 billion dlrs.    In a briefing for reporters, Bank President AntonioOrtiz-Mena said that this year lending by the bank "will be at asimilar level to last year."    He noted that bank lending in 1986 was directedparticularly to projects in energy, agriculture, andenvironmental and public health, education and urbandevelopment. The annual report was released as the Bank'sannual meeting is being held in Miami.    Ortiz-Mena told reporters that the bank's member countrieswill discuss a plan by the United States to reduce the loanveto power from the current majority to 35 pct.    Such a plan would allow the United States to block any loanit did not like with the assistance of only one other country.    The proposal, which is tied to any U.S. backing for a newfinancing for the bank, is sure to run into rough going as theLatin countries view it as a move by the Reagan administrationto control the agency's critical loans.    The U.S. position is that it is not seeking veto poweralthough it believes the bank's largest contributors shouldhave greater influence within the institution.    Reuter&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - NOVEL GMAC FINANCING, Because its novel financing deal soldquickly last week, General Motors Corp's &lt;GM> General MotorsAcceptance Corp unit plans to do more multi-tiered financings,said Michael Mangan of GMAC.    "We are certainly happy with the transaction. We plan to domore," said Mangan, director of corporate financing.    Offered on Wednesday, the 100 mln dlr issue had three pricelevels to attract a wide range of retail investors and smallregional institutions, said officers of P.W. Korth and Co Incand PaineWebber Inc, which shared bookrunning duties.    "We will continue to look at multi-tiered financings,"Mangan said.    "GMAC plans to talk to Korth and PaineWebber and get theirthoughts on the deal. We want to see how it went and where thesecurities were placed," the GMAC officer added.    Mangan and the co-lead managers said the three differentpricings enabled the finance arm of General Motors to borrow atattractive rates. "GMAC saved some basis points with thistechnique," said an officer on Korth's syndicate desk.    "Our all-in-cost was comparable. If the deal had not madesense, obviously we would not have done it," Mangan noted.    The GMAC seven-year notes were given a coupon of 7.45 pct.    For investors buying less than 100,000 dlrs of the notes,the offering was priced at par to yield 45 basis points overcomparable Treasury securities.    Those buying 100,000 to 250,000 dlrs pay 99.60 for a yieldof 7.52 pct, or 53 basis points over Treasuries. For purchasesof more than 250,000 dlrs, the notes carried a price of 99.20to yield 7.599 pct, or 61 basis points over Treasuries.    In contrast, Ford Motor Co's &lt;F> Ford Motor Credit Co unitlast month sold 300 mln dlrs of same-maturity notes priced toyield 7.62 pct, or 62.5 basis points over Treasuries.    "Retail investors generally do not see new issue product,"said an officer on PaineWebber's corporate syndicate desk."They have to buy the securities in the secondary market."    Bond traders said many corporates rose well above par inthe secondary market this year. They attributed this to a hugenumber of bond redemptions by the issuing companies.    "Institutions and mutual funds are seeing some of theirholdings called away. They're scrambling to replace them," saidone trader. As a result, underwriters said retail investorswould gladly sacrifice some of the yield spread over Treasuriesif they could buy debt issues at or below par.    "The GMAC financing seemed tailor-made for those retailinvestors," commented one underwriter away from the syndicate.    GMAC's Mangan said his firm also wanted to sell securitiesthat were aimed at the retail sector.    "Access to retail investors was the driving force behindthe multi-tiered financing. This is a new market for us, so tospeak," Mangan said.    "There is a lot of GMAC paper out there," the executiveadded, referring to the unit's past offerings. "One of ourbasic strategies is to target securities to specific investorsand hopefully attain a broader distribution."    Officers of Korth and PaineWebber said the GMAC notes wereselling quickly last week, although the issue had not sold outby Friday afternoon.    "In selling to retail investors or smaller institutions,you have to make a lot more telephone calls," an investmentbanker pointed out.    Underwriters noted that Korth and PaineWebber, along withco-managers A.G. Edwards and Thomson McKinnon, have strongretail bases. "They can carve out a niche here," one said.    "We plan to underwrite more of these deals," said a Korthofficial. An officer with PaineWebber echoed that sentiment.    Multi-tiered financings are a relatively new wrinkle onWall Street. An officer with Korth said he belives his firmunderwrote the first such issue eight or nine months ago forCiticorp &lt;CCI>.    GMAC's Mangan said his company issued through Korth inOctober 1986 a 50 mln dlr issue that carried two differentprice levels.    "But the price gap between the first and second tier waslarge," Mangan said. In our conversations with theunderwriters, we thought three different tiers would make moresense because the prices would not be far apart."    Meanwhile, underwriting syndicates are scheduled to bidcompetitively tomorrow for 250 mln dlrs of first and refundingmortgage bonds due 2017 of Philadelphia Electric Co &lt;PE>.Non-refundable for five years, the debt is rated Baa-3 byMoody's and BBB-minus by Standard and Poor's.    Southern Railway Co, a unit of Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC>,will hold accept bids on Wednesday for 20 mln dlrs of serialequipment trust certificates.

In its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, theBank made it clear, however, that the Latin countries neededvast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen theirailing economies in the period ahead.    The report said that Latin America continued to emergeslowly from the deep recession that began in the early 1980s,with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) edging up to nearly four pctfrom 3.5 pct in 1985.    The report said the region's improved economic growth lastyear was based on a rise in internal demand and fullerutilization of previously underused production capacity.    "This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 andbeyond because no significant new investments are being made,"the report said.

"Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no meanswrong. Unless we reform the system now, Japan is bound todecay, perhaps within the next 10 years," Nakasone toldsupporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwidevote since the LDP's general election victory last July.    Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining tofight a proposed five pct sales tax, one of the main planks inthe tax reform package, and are now challenging theLDP-dominated local governments and assemblies.    In Tokyo, incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by theLDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support thesales tax as it stands.    A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just overthree weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they wouldtake the tax, which Nakasone proposes to implement nextJanuary, into consideration when they vote.

reut2-008.sgm, BAKER SAYS U.S. MAKING PROGRESS REFORMING IADB, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker saidhe was making progress negotiating reform of the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank with other member nations.    In a speech prepared for delivery to the annual meeting ofthe IADB, Baker said, "We are making progress in negotiatingreforms."    And he added that if succesful, Washington would be readyto put up an additional nine billion dlrs to the seventh IADBfour-year capital replenishment, an increase of 75 pct.    It was not immediately clear what the overall size of thecapital replenishment would be if the U.S. went ahead with sucha capital increase.    But Baker's statement that he had made progress innegotiating reforms came after a weekend meeting of the bank'spolicy making board of governors at which the reform issue wasput off until next June because of deep differences betweenWashington and Latin borrowing countries.    Baker said the U.S. increase would account for 70 pct ofthe bank's useable financial resources.    Currently Washington is only allowed to vote 34.5 pct inIADB board meetings considering loans to Latin Americancountries.    But the Latin borrowing nations control 54 pct of the voteand frequently approve loans to which economic reformconditions are not tied.    Baker pointed out that Western nations which provide 95 pctof the bank's financial resources represent just 46 pct of thevote.    Baker said the U.S seeks a greater say in bank decisionsfor itself and other creditor countries.    "In view of this imbalance we don't believe it isunreasonable to ask for a change," Baker said. He said thechanges sought by the U.S. would require loan approval by agreater majority of shares than a simple majority.    But he stopped short of reaffirming the original U.S.position that veto power should exist with a 35 pct vote.    Enlarging on reforms Washington would like to see, Bakersaid he wanted the IADB to play a much greater role in the U.S.debt strategy for promoting inflation free economic growth,open markets and a reduced government role in the economies ofdebtor nations.    Under reforms he said the U.S. wants the IADB to adopt amajor program of lending to specific economic sectors in debtorcountries on condition the countries carried out policy reformsin those areas of their economies.    Such reforms would include, among other things, moreconcern for natural resource management.    Baker said this lending should help debtors make atransition to more open economies and freer markets.    He also said the bank could double its current lendingvolume from capital and triple its concessional loans to thepoorest nations.

Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhatfrom 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be downslightly from a year ago, it said.

He told the annual news conference that possible creditrisks, especially those associated with foreign nations, hadlargely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were thereforeunlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.    Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profitincreased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.    Hackl said that interest margins in the banking businesshad declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previousyear. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increasedslightly and stood around 0.7 pct.    Parent bank commission surplus in the securities businesshad risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.    Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mlnmarks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.    The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, whichexcludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbedtwo pct to 671 mln marks.    The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.    It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgagebusiness and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.    The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank businessvolume rose to 46 pct from 45.    Hackl said that in January and February this year, thebank's credit business had not livened up. But despite thesharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on ownaccount had increased in the first two 1987 months comparedwith the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

reut2-008.sgm, BAKER URGES BANKS TO MULL NEW LOAN PLANS, Treasury Secretary James Baker urgedcommercial banks to be open to new ideas for reducing the thirdworld debt burden.    "I believe the commercial banks need to be open to creativeideas for reducing the debt burden," Baker told the annualmeeting of the Inter-American Development Bank.    But he said that he was confident banks would make"substantial new lending" to the major debtors this year.    He pointed out principal debtor nations are expected togrow an average 3.5 pct this year, the fastest real rate ofgrowth since 1980.    Saying the U.S. debt strategy was making "substantialheadway", Baker said import volumes of debtor countries areforecast to jump over six pct in 1987 and export volumes almostfive pct -- the best performance in three years.    He also said economic growth has kept pace with orsurpassed the growth in debt for nine of the 15 major debtorssince 1983.    "This is a start -- and I venture to say a good one," theTreasury Secretary said, and he urged the audience of Westernand Latin finance officials and bankers to stand fast againstsuggestions of solutions like debt relief.    While such ideas have political appeal, Baker said, theywould mean a drying up of capital flowing to debtors.    And even if free market reforms followed, debt fogivenesswould frighten away investors who would not "risk their capitalin a country which abandoned its obligations."    And he said, "A debt forgiveness plan that damagescommercial banks also weakens confidence in world financialstability."    He cautioned that resolving the debt situation would be a"gradual and painstaking" process, varying from country tocountry.    Reporting on the U.S. debt strategy, Baker said attitudesin debtor nations have changed and there is much greateracceptance of free market reforms than hitherto.    Some countries like Argentina are pursuing anti-inflationprograms. Others, like the Philippines and Chile, areprivatizing companies and swapping debt for equity.    The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, meanwhile,have committed nearly 12 billion dlrs in loans for the 15 majordebtor nations since late 1985, official creditors haverescheduled 14.5 billion dlrs in outstanding loans through theParis club, while commercial banks are making new loans.    Baker pointed out the banks have rescheduld nearly 70billion dlrs of debt, reaching agreements recently with Chile,Venezuela and Mexico.    Elsewhere in his speech, Baker outlined the progressindustrial nations are making in promoting moderate globalgrowth, low inflation and efforts to reduce massive tradeimbalances.    He maintained world economic conditions were "continuuing toimprove" a development that would provide a positive backdropfor debtor nations. Reuter&#3;

Addressing Argentine businessman during the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank (IADB) meeting here, he said the two sideswill meet again next Thursday in New York.    "We have made significant progress over the last 30 daysand we should have an agreement in a shorter lapse of time thanmanaged by Mexico, Venezuela or Chile," he said.    Brodersohn reiterated that Argentina's goal is to reach anagreement which permits four pct growth this year, followinglast year's 5.5 pct and negative growth in 1985.    He said discussions were still continuing ondebt-capitalization plans and schemes for on-lending, in thelight of certain Argentine concerns.    The government is anxious that debt that is capitalizedshould represent new investment in the country on a dollarinvested per dollar capitalized basis, rather than a simpletransfer of ownership of the debt, he said.    At the same time, it wants to avoid an expansionarymonetary impact from on-lending schemes, whereby debtrepayments are recycled by banks into new loans.    Brodersohn said also agreement was close on the proposalfor so-called exit bonds, whereby creditors can sell out theirdebt.    Argentina's 1987 financing needs come to 3.53 billion dlrs,including the 2.15 billion from banks and a 1.38 billion dlrIMF loan already agreed. It is projecting a current accountdeficit of 2.2 billion dlrs after one of 2.4 billion last year.

Zemljaric was not quoted as saying whether the two billiondlrs referred to principal or interest or both. Yugoslavia'shard currency debt stands between 19 and 20 billion dlrs.    Zemljaric said the International Monetary Fund criticisedYugoslavia for not regulating consumption, not having realinterest rates or market exchange rates, for its inability tocontrol monetary policy and slow pace of reform.    He said the criticisms were in a report by an IMFcommission which visited Yugoslavia last December and January.    "We cannot accept this assessment because we have made notinconsiderable progress under difficult conditions, even thoughwe are aware of our own weaknesses," Zemljaric said.    He said the report favourably assessed some trends in theYugoslav economy but did not say which.

reut2-008.sgm, INDEX TRADING NOT TO BLAME FOR WALL STREET FALL, A report by the U.S. Securities andExchange Commission (SEC) concluded that index trading was notto blame for the two-day stock market drop that occurred Sept.11-12, 1986    The report, made public today, concluded that index tradingmagnified but was not the cause of last fall's two-day120-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Index.    The commission staff said it planned to continue to closelymonitor developments in index-related trading but planned noimmediate regulatory action as a result of the precipitousstock market decline.    "The magnitude of the September decline was a result ofchanges in investors' perceptions of fundamental economicconditions, rather than artifical forces arising fromindex-related trading strategies," the report said.    "Nevertheless, index-related futures trading wasinstrumental in the rapid transmission of these changedinvestor perceptions to individual stock prices, and may havecondensed the time period in which the decline occurred."    The SEC staff concluded its study "does not provide anindependent basis to conclude that radical regulatory orstructural changes are necessary at this time."    The report said "the dramatic growth in the size andinstitutional use of index products requires continued carefulanalysis of the potential for disruption of the stock market aswell as manipulative or other inappropriate trading in theindex products and their component stocks."    It said there "may be merit" to requiring additionalreporting and record keeping procedures for index-relatedtrading. But it added that the SEC staff has not yet consideredthe costs and benefits of the various alternatives.    The report does not deal with a second precipitous dip inthe market which occurred Jan. 23.    On that day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 115points in little more than an hour.    The SEC said its staff was still analyzing the underlyingcauses of that price decline and had not yet made findings.    The SEC study was made after a number of investors, newsreports and other analysts blamed the Sept. 11-12 drop onso-called "program trading," in which computers rapidly executecomplex trading strategies designed to profit from minutechanges in the relationship between the price of stock indexfutures and the stocks that make up the index.    The investors and analysts complained that such rapidmovements in the stock market would drive small investors outof the market and possible even lead to a stock market crash.    But the SEC report said the possibility of a marketcollapse was "remote."    It said it believed any rapid stock price decline "likely"would eventually be reversed by renewed buying as pricesreached far lower levels.    It also argued that index futures and options are importantto traders who use them to hedge their market positions andlessen risk exposure.    "While a 'cascade effect' may be possible as a result ofindex-related trading, it did not ocur on Sept. 11 and 12," thereport concluded. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER, Portugal's Agriculture Minister AlvaroBarreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the stategrain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals importtenders open to private traders.    Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmittedto the tenders.    Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to theEuropean Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC(Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reducedby 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.    Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon'scivil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this monththat EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done,in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.    As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.    Barreto said, "My objective is put EPAC into the tendersbecause it has a right to take part." He added the governmentwould be studying the court order to see whether or not theruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.    Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator,whether public or private, from the tenders. Private tradershad argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in thePortuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.    "There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,"Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission hadaccepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible.    The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation inthe public tenders was unfair competition and violated theclauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with thegradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

reut2-008.sgm, TEXACO &lt;TX> SAYS IT HAS EVIDENCE OF JUDGE'S BIAS, Texaco Inc said it has fileda motion with the Texas Court of Appeals to supplement thecourt record with new evidence it has just received of allegedbias by Judge Anthony J.P. Farris against Texaco and its chieftrial lawyer in its litigation with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.    The company contended that the alleged bias provides cleargrounds for a new trial. It said the motion was filed inconnection with its appeal of the Pennzoil judgment pending inthat court.    Texaco said the motion introduces two letters written byFarris, who has since died, to two Houston lawyers in late1984, after he had been assigned the case but before the trialbegan.    The company alleged that Farris harbored personal animosityagainst Texaco and its chief trial lawyer, Richard B. Miller,due to an earlier motion to have Farris disqualified from thecase. The motion was filed due to Farris' acceptance of a10,000 dlr campaign contribution from Pennzoil's chief triallawyer, Joseph P. Jamail, shortly after the case was assignedto him, Texaco said.    In February the Texas Appellate Court refused to grantTexaco a new trial, finding no evidence that Farris was biased.    Texaco said it is preparing its application for a rehearingon the merits of its case before the Texas Appelate Court, andthe application will be filed on March 30.    The company said it will ask the court to reconsider itsdecision on the issue of due process in light of the Farrisletters.    In the suit, Pennzoil has been awarded about 10.53 billiondlrs in damages from Texaco in connection with Pennzoil'sproposed merger with Getty Oil Co, which was later taken overby Texaco. Texaco is appealing the ruling.    A Texaco spokeswoman said the company had known of theletters for some time but were unable to release them until nowdue to understandings of confidentiality with the attorneysfrom which they were secured.

reut2-008.sgm, TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED, Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, todaylodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented itspetition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC.    The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22,when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimedby banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of thecollapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985.AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal.    The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred onthree points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head ofthe broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters.    The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction towind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an associationwithin the meaning of the Companies Act, and that thewinding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of anarbitration award. AMT will contest all three points.    The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of thewinding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT willargue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnoldsaid.    The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of anarbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that thecourt accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move toenforce an arbitration ruling.    The court originally decided that the winding-up petitionwent wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMTspokesman said.    The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, buta case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to beheard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have areceiver appointed over the ITC's assets.    Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it ispossible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could beconsolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.    Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against theCouncil's member states and an application by the governmentsto strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner(Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.    Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin"ring-out" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in thenear future.

reut2-008.sgm, U.S. PREPARED TO ESCORT KUWAITI TANKERS, The United States has offered Navywarships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-shipmissiles, U.S. defense officials said today.    "We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the SovietUnion about the possibility of using Soviet tankers" to shiptheir oil, one of the officials told Reuters. "But if there issuperpower protection, we would rather it come from us," theofficial said.    The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwaithad asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels, mostof them oil tankers, which could be supplied by three U.S. Navyguided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates nowin the southern part of the Gulf.    "We told them we would give them help and we are waiting tohear the Kuwaiti response to our offer," one official said.    In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's smallMideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon hasmoved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk-- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month.    White House and defense officials said today that massingof the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with theIran-Iraq war or Iran's recent stationing of Chinese-made anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.    The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwaitand other Middle East countries that their oil shipments mightbe affected. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit inthe  Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984. White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was inthe U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in thegulf and through the Straits of Hormuz.    But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routinemaneuvers.    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined todiscuss specifics, but said the United States would do whateverwas necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of newIranian anti-ship missiles in the region.    "We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep theshipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available inthat very vital waterway of the world," he said on NBCtelevision's "Meet the Press."    The State Department said Friday Iran has been informedabout U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in theGulf. The communciation was sent through Switzerland, whichrepresents American interests in Iran.     Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intendedto threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United Statesthat any interference in the region would meet a strongresponse from Tehran, Tehran Radio said.    An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted in abroadcast monitored by the BBC in London, said reports thatIran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless.

reut2-008.sgm, WEST AFRICA NATIONS RECEIVE MOST EC EXPORT AID, Senegal, Ivory Coast and Ghana are thebiggest recipients among developing nations of a specialEuropean Community (EC) aid program to compensate for lostexport earnings, EC figures published today showed.    The EC has special trading and aid agreements with 66countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. Thisincludes a program called STABEX under which it provides aid toexport-dependent countries if export earnings drop too much.    Senegal received about 155 mln European Currency Units (176mln dlrs) between 1975 and 1984 mainly to compensate for a fallin its peanut export earnings.    The Ivory Coast received 108 mln ECUs (123 mln dlrs) andGhana received 91 mln ECUs (104 mln dlrs) mostly to make up fora drop in coffee and cocoa export earnings.    Under the EC's STABEX aid program (export earningsstabilisation system), the Community provides special financialassistance to developing countries if export earnings incertain raw materials fall below an established level.    The EC provided about 1.06 billion ECUs (1.21 billion dlrs)in STABEX aid from 1975 to 1984, including 273 mln ECUs (311mln dlrs) for losses in peanut exports, 261 mln ECUs (298 mlndlrs) for coffee and 150 mln ECUs (171 mln dlrs) for cocoa.

Sosnoff said the talks with Pratt and Southmark are notbeing actively pursued at the presentand may or may not becontinued in the future.  He said there could be no assurancethat a joint venture would be formed or that Caesars wouldagreed to talks.  "Several preliminary contacts withrepresentatives of Caesars have not resulted in any indicationthat it wishes to enter into such negotiations," Sosnoff said.    He said based on talks with staff members of gamingauthorities, there can be no assurance that the necessaryregulatory review of its bid for Caesars World can be completedby the original April Three expiration date.    Sosnoff said it has extended the tender until May 15.  Thebid remains subject to regulatory approvals and the arrangementof financing.    Pratt, which owns the Sands Hotel and Casino in AtlanticCity, N.J., where Caesars operates the Boardwalk Regency Hoteland Casino, recently waged an apparently unsuccessful campaignto acquire control of Resorts International Inc &lt;RTA> againstNew York developer Donald Trump.  Southmark owns about 37 pctof Pratt Hotel.    Caesars World's boasrd has urged rejection of the offer onthe grounds that it is inadequate and has said it wouldinvestigate alternative transactions.

reut2-008.sgm, TECHNOLOGY/ATT'S &lt;T>  EFFORTS TO SELL COMPUTERS, American Telephone and Telegraph Co isanother illustration of a maxim already learned by severalother huge corporations - that success in one segment of theelectronics industry is very difficult to translate intosuccess selling computers.    ATT is learning the hard way that all the resources andtechnological advances in the world can not make up for weakmarketing and sluggish responses to one of the most rapidlychanging and competitive industries.    Consequently, ATT will try again this week to convince theworld that it is serious about computers, after four years inthe business, by announcing a set of new products andshowcasing its latest computer chief, Vittorio Cassoni,formerly of ATT's Italian affiliate Ing. C. Olivetti and Co.    Industry consultants said ATT will announce a fasteraddition to its 3B line of minicomputers, improved connectivityproducts, a new version of its Unix software operating systemand assortered peripheral equipment, including a laser printer.    The announcements, however, hold "minimal significance" forboth ATT and the industry, said Forrester Research consultantJohn McCarthy. "They are just never going to be a significantplayer in this market as long as computers play a subjagatedrole to the (telephone) network," he said.    ATT, the world's largest company before its breakup in 1984and still the pre-eminent phone company in the United States,has only been able to carve out a fractional share of thecomputer industry.    Last year was particularly disastrous for the company'sdata systems division, which posted a pre-tax operating lossfor the year of 1.2 billion dlrs (ATT as a whole reported a1986 profit of 139 mln, after a 1.7 billion dlr charge againstearnings, down from 1.56 billion dlrs the prior year).    Morale is down throughout the company after ATT reduced itswork force by 32,000 people last year, leaving a work force of290,000, but analysts say the situation in the computerdivision is particularly bad, especially since the computermerged its computer and network sales forces.    Meanwhile, the company's most successful product, the 6300personal computer, ran out of steam in the last three months ofthe year after gaining some five pct of the market.    "ATT seemed to lose their focus with the 6300," saidconsultant Norman DeWitt, president of Dataquest Inc. "Therewere no major product enhancements last year and a perceptiondeveloped in the marketplace that the product was tired."    Meanwhile, the 6300 had to face increasingly aggressivecompetition from smaller companies that undercut ATT on priceand offered more technologically advanced machines. "I wouldhave to say that, after a fast start, ATT just lost momentum onthe pc side," said DeWitt.    The 3B line of minicomputers has never found greatacceptance in the market and ATT's Unix operating system,though loved by scientists and engineers, has yet to put aserious dent in the much more widely used systems adopted byindustry giant International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>.    By last fall, ATT executives found themselves trying todefuse widespread speculation that ATT was going to abandon orsell off the computer division and the company turned over allresponsibility for personal computers to Olivetti, in which itsowns a 23.5 pct stake.    But analysts said the company's image was dealt anotherblow last week when ATT senior vice president James Edwards,who preceded Cassoni as head of the computer division,announced he was leaving to become president of TelWatch Inc, asmall developer of systems to manage networks.    Several other executives have also left in recent months,including John Walsh, head of the 3B minicomputer line. And,although the 43-year old Cassoni has considerable experiencerunning Olivetti's successful computer operations, analystsexpressed concern about his approach to ATT's business.    Cassoni has said he wants to acheive recognizable successin both within ATT and in the marketplace within two years andit is widely assumed that he will rapidly abandon any productthat does not meet those profitability goals.     The problem with such a strategy, analysts said, is thatit may not give certain products enough time to becomeestablished and customers may be reluctant to buy a productthat could be discontinued in a year or two.    ATT chairman James Olson took a slightly more conservativeview of the computer division recently. He lauded Cassoni's twoyear goal but said he expects the data systems division to turnaround within five years.    Olson denied the perception that ATT was retreating "to thewomb, going back to our old business" of long distancetelephone systems at the expense of the computer division. Reuter&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS, Iraq said today its warplnes hadattacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed tokeep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.    The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installationsbroke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.    It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdadhailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranianyear which ended on Saturday.    A high command communique said warplanes hit the westernjetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon andstruck a supertanker nearby at the same time.    The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August1985, was last raided in January.    The communique did not identify the supertanker, but saidcolumns of smoke were seen billowing from it.    In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iraniantanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlierGulf attack.    But there has been no independent confirmation of today'ssupertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported byBaghdad in the past 24 hours.    The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight,when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.    Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields atNowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.    The three oilfields have been raided several times in thepast three years. Oil sources said they were not cruciallyimportant to Iran's oil export trade.    A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanesflew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the warfront.    It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units andseveral Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oilterminal at the northen tip of the Gulf.    Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with theiroccupants and the others fled, it said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, TALKING POINT/WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL &lt;WEN>, Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy'sInternational Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took thefizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interestedsuitor.    Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and losta point when Coca Cola &lt;KO> said the rumors were untrue.However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of morethan three mln shares.    Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet theysaid they could not conclude a takeover of the fast foodrestaurant chain was impossible.    Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of aBusiness Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitorand which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.    Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc &lt;BUD> andPepsico Inc &lt;PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neitherof those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy'sofficial.    "It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, butits not unusual for us to be linked with those companies," saidDenny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.    However, Lynch would not comment specifically on thecurrent market rumors.    Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had beenskeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated itviews fast food chains as customers and does not want to becomea competitor to them.    "I can't put another name on it," said Kidder peabodyanalyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold upWendy's stock. "It very well could be someone's interested."    But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right timefor Wendy's to be sold.    "They're obviously having operational difficulties. I'vealways believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (anoffer), but I can't believe this is the right price at theright time," Freedman said.    "If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to controlthe situation," Freedman said.    "I just don't think there's anything going on. I don'tthink it's worth much more than where it is," said Joseph Doyleof Smith Barney.    Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the "burgerwars" between itself, McDonald's Corp &lt;MCD> and Pillsbury Co's&lt;PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast foodhamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same storesales last year, analysts said.    Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-pricedbreakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Someanalysts said the company should be bringing in new products,but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.    There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may bevulnerable to a takeover.    James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company hasimproved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a highpercent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.    "They also have some attractive leaseholds on theirrestaurants," Murren said.    Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in thefourth quarter. "That was about the first time in sevenquarters," he said.    Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something couldbe going on with Wendy's. "My gut feeling is something's goingto happen. I don't know what," she said.    She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrsper share.    One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitorbecause Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains insteadof Pepsi.    Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought byPepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES DRAWN INTO VW CASE, West Germany's banking authoritiesare being drawn into the currency scandal surroundingVolkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> as the repercussions and allegations inthe financial community widen, banking sources said.    The Bundesbank has seconded one of its currency experts tohelp the state prosecutor investigating the currency fraud atVolkswagen, VW, in Brunswick, a Bundesbank spokesman said.    The Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin alsois considering press allegations that several banks "parked" openpositions with VW, breaching banking regulations.    Earlier this month Volkswagen said it had incurredpotential losses of 480 mln marks in an alleged fraud involvingthe hedging of open currency positions.    The foreign exchange activities of a large non-bankcorporation would not normally attract the attention of WestGerman banking regulators.    Their strict foreign exchange rules, set up after theHerstatt banking crash in 1974, apply only to banks.    "This strict banking supervision aims to protect specialinterests -- creditors and depositors," the Bundesbank spokesmansaid, adding company shareholders were not covered.    "The Volkswagen case, in so far as it involves Volkswagen'snormal foreign exchange business, lies far outside the area ofthe Bundesbank," he said.    The Bundesbank's decision to send a currency expert toBrunswick to help investigations into activities involvingVolkswagen's foreign exchange dealing room was part of thenormal assistance rendered by one public authority to another.    The expert will count as part of the state prosecutor'sstaff and not report back to the Bundesbank, he said.    But the Bundesbank could get more closely involved inallegations that banks used VW to circumvent regulations.    Section 1a of the Banking Law requires banks at the closeof business each day to hold no more than 30 pct of theircapital and reserves in open positions.    The section was introduced after the Herstatt bank crash in1974 due to currency speculation.    The Platow Brief financial newsletter said on Friday thatabout 16 banks, mainly foreign, had been circumventing section1a by "parking" such excess open positions with VW.    This would mean that the bank concerned would sell theposition temporarily to VW, buying it back a day or so later.    However, such repurchase agreements are expressly includedin section 1a as still counting as open positions.    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office inWest Berlin said it was following the allegations butinvestigations were difficult because the 16 banks had not beennamed. He declined to say what steps were being taken.    But banking sources said the Supervisory Office as aninitial step had approached the Platow Brief for the identityof the banks, but this had been refused. The Platow Briefdeclined comment.    If the Supervisory Office ascertains that the bankingregulations have been infringed, it will pursue the case withthe assistance of the Bundesbank.    The Office, subordinate to the Finance Ministry, does nothave branches outside Berlin.    The independent Bundesbank however operates 203 branches inWest Germany, closely monitoring local banks.    Banks deposit statistics, including currency position data,once a month with the Bundesbank's regional administrations atfederal state level, the Landeszentralbanken (LZBs).    Currency dealers said parking excess positions withnon-banking corporates was frequent practice.    Such positions would often be sold for tomorrow/nextdelivery, with a verbal agreement to buy it back the next dayat the same rate.    A VW spokesman said it was company policy not to undertakecurrency hedging but he confirmed that arbitrage was allowed.    He declined to estimate the volume of currency arbitraging.German press reports have put it at 80 billion marks a year.    The spokesman declined to comment on how it would have beenpossible to carry out a fraud involving currency hedging giventhe company's policy not to conduct this kind of business.    VW finance director Rolf Selowsky accepted responsibilityand resigned. VW has suspended six other officials and firedits former foreign exchange chief, Burkhard "Bobby" Junger.    Management board chief Carl Hahn told a ceremony todaymarking VW's 50 millionth vehicle that personnel changes didnot mean any of those involved was guilty. REUTER&#3;

Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints aboutthe impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish ECmembership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.    All this produce will be imported into Spain at speciallevy levels likely to be below those applying for imports intoother EC countries.    The sources said it was possible that the Spanishintervention board would be asked to buy the produce directlythis year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.    They added that the choice for future years appears to liebetween a system of regular tenders and the setting of a dailyspecial levy applicable to Spanish imports.

The measures follow renewed controversy over the limits ofSwiss secrecy, prompted by recent allegations that both formerPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos and U.S. Officials linkedwith the arms-for-Iran scandal had accounts here.    The Swiss Bankers Association said it wanted to curb theright of bank clients to hide their identity behind lawyers.    The association said it would insist that banks identifyanyone doing cash business at the counter worth more than100,000 francs, down from a current 500,000.    Banks would continue to be required to identify theirclients in other cases and pledge not actively to help capitalflight, or tax fraud. They would also still face fines of up to10 mln francs in case of abuse.

reut2-008.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BRAZIL DEBT DEADLINES LOOM, Slow progress in talks between Brazil andits major foreign creditors has increased the likelihood thatU.S. banks will declare their loans to Brazil non-performing atthe end of the quarter, bankers said.    Several banks, citing Brazil's suspension of interestpayments on 68 billion dlrs of its 108 billion dlr foreign debtand the absence of a coherent economic plan, have already saidthey might take such a step, even though it would cost themtens of millions of dollars in profits.    An inconclusive meeting here March 22 between central bankgovernor Francisco Gros and Brazil's bank advisory committeecan only have stiffened that resolve.    A nasty row is also looming over 16 billion dlrs of tradeand money-market lines which Brazil froze last month.    The legal commitment to maintain these credits runs out onMarch 31, and the worried talk at the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank annual meeting here is that some disgruntledbank will sue for repayment, raising the specter of a cascadeof lawsuits and tit-for-tat asset seizures.    "My gut feeling is that common sense will prevail. But isthere a risk? Yes, the mood out there is pretty nasty," one NewYork banker commented.    Two or three years ago, a showdown between the world'slargest debtor and its largest creditors would have sent shockwaves through the financial markets. But no longer.    Some U.S. money-center bank stocks fell by about 10 pct inthe immediate aftermath of Brazil's payments halt. But, in theEurodeposit markets, which bankers consider to be the mostsensitive gauge of confidence, there was no discernible flightout of bank instruments and into safer government bonds.    In fact, the system has calmly withstood the suspension, inpart or in full, of interest payments by countries owing about150 billion dlrs of the region's total foreign debt of 380billion.    Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala andNicaragua had all curtailed payments before Brazil.    The explanation for the fairly relaxed view is that net newbank lending to Latin America has dried up at the same time asbanks have steadily bolstered their capital base. As a result,exposure relative to capital has fallen and few now fear forthe collapse of a major bank.    That is why, banking analysts have said, Citicorp &lt;CCI>felt emboldened to state early in the day that it might putBrazil on a cash basis even before interest becomes 90 daysoverdue. It would forfeit 190 mln dlrs of profits this year asa result, but for a company which earned over a billion dlrs in1986 the setback would be manageable.    Some other banks are not as strong, however, and aprotracted confrontation with Brazil could still seriouslyerode depositor and investor confidence, especially if otherdebtors are emboldened to follow suit and press for debt relief.    Bankers are thus working hard to isolate Brazil. Financingagreements were reached recently with Chile and Venezuela, anaccord with the Philippines seems to be close at hand, and adeal with Argentina on new loans and a debt restructuring couldbe reached in the next two weeks, bankers say.    In taking a hard line against wholesale debt relief, thebanks have the clear backing of the Reagan Administration. "Allof us have a stake in the stability of the world banking system- a debt forgiveness plan that damages commercial banks alsoweakens confidence in world financial stability," U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker told the IADB meeting.    Some European bankers, however, argue that capitalizationof interest is already happening in practice and that the banksought to face up to the fact and work with the debtors onlonger-term solutions that recognize that not all the interestcan be paid back right away.    Rigid accounting rules have prevented U.S. banks fromseriously considering adding interest to the principal of aloan because they would have to declare the loannon-performing. But, Brazilian central bank governor Gros said,if the banks are now volunteering to take that step, they mightbe more willing to discuss new ideas for debt relief.    "It's not necessarily an unfavorable development," Grossaid when asked about the prospect of Brazilian loans being puton a cash basis.    "We find more room to discuss these things (innovations)with European banks which have already bitten the bullet."     What is clear, however, is that banks are so angry andfrustrated with Brazil that they are in no mood to offer quickconcessions.    A long war of attrition on the debt front lies ahead. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, JUDGE, EX-SENATOR AMONG CONTENDERS FOR SEC POST, A federal judge and a former U.S.senator are among the top contenders to replace John Shad aschairman of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC), government sources said.    Also on the list of possible replacements are two currentSEC commissioners, said the sources who asked not to be named.    Last week the White House said it would name Shad U.S.ambassador to the Netherlands. Among those most frequentlyplaced on the short list of Shad's possible successors wereKevin Duffy, a New York federal judge, and Nicholas Brady, whoserved about eight months in the Senate in 1981.    Brady, currently a managing partner with the New Yorkinvestment banking firm of Dillon, Read and Co Inc, was aninterim replacement for Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) afterWilliams resigned in a congressional bribery scandal. Duffy wasSEC New York regional administrator during 1969-72.    However, congressional sources speculated Brady may beunwilling to take the SEC post because he is active in VicePresident George Bush's presidential campaign.    The SEC commissioners said to be possible replacements forShad are Charles Cox and Edward Fleischman.    Fleischman was a New York securities lawyer before his SECappointment while Cox was the commission's chief economist.    Sen. William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat whose SenateBanking Committee would hold confirmation hearings on the newchairman, said he hoped that Shad's successor "would be verysupportive of the division of enforcement's on-goinginvestigation of the scandals on Wall Street and would besomeone who did not come directly from the industry."    The White House said on Friday it would nominate Shad, 63,to succeed L. Paul Bremer as the U.S. ambassador to theNetherlands. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, IBM &lt;IBM> REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST, International Business Machines Corp,hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back bythe end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst RickMartin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.    "There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit notuntil later this year," Martin said at a technology conferencesponsored by the investment firm.    Martin said the coming rebound reflects new productintroductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drasticimprovement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.    IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs inmid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at149-1/2 dlrs.    Analysts, computer industry executives, and the companyitself, have highlighted the external economic factorshampering IBM's growth.    But Martin said the product cycle was key to understandingthe rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, andpointed to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> to support his view."By replacing the product line, earnings have soared," he saidof DEC's line of VAX computers.    In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatiblemid-range product line. A new computer code-named "Fort Knox"was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-rangesystems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.    Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into theIBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects shouldbe unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. "The major story will be arebound in its mid-range business."    He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growthin mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.    High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are comingto the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth willdrop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.    By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martinsaid. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of51.3 billion dlrs.    Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earningsand stock have been propelled by a strong slew of productintroductions in the mid-range area.    In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat toDEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies werecatering largely to existing customer bases, rather thanstealing market share from one another.

reut2-008.sgm, 1987 U.S. SOYBEAN LOAN SHOULD STAY SAME-AMSTUTZ, Congress should give the U.S.Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybeanloan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushelin order to help resolve the problem of soybean exportcompetitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.    Speaking to reporters following a Senate AgricultureAppropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out ofthe current soybean program "dilemma" would be for Congress toallow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if theloan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to makeU.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates tofurther buydown the loan rate.    Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot beless than 4.77 dlrs per bu.    Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change thefarm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.    The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.    Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision onsoybean program changes will be the budget costs.    He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is thatthe U.S. loan rate provides an "umbrella" to foreign productionand causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.    Asked about the American Soybean Association's request forsome form of income support, Amstutz said "the competitiveproblem is the most severe."

reut2-008.sgm, BAKER SAYS LATINS BALK AT U.S. IADB COMPROMISE, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker saidleading Latin American nations have delayed accepting a U.S.compromise proposal on major reforms of the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank.    In an interview with a small group of reporters, Baker saiddiscussions on far-reaching reforms of the bank would resumearound the fringes of the semiannual meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund in two weeks time.    But Baker said his compromise proposal, which he would notdisclose, was no longer on the table.    "I made it clear that the proposal was not one that Iexpected to leave out there if we could not resolve it at thismeeting," Baker said.    The U.S. had pressed for virtual veto power over IADB loanswhich were made on terms Washington considers far too lax.    In a bid to integrate the Bank into the U.S. debt strategy,Washington has suggested it would be ready to subscribe ninebillion dlrs to a new four-year capital replenishment of theBank.    In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pctsimple majority voting power over IADB lending.    Baker said, "In my view, they have not rejected it out ofhand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose toadvance it at the April meeting."    A U.S. contribution of that size would lead to an effectivefour-year lending program by the Bank of 22.9 billion dlrs.    The actual capital increase would amount to 27 billiondlrs, but usable resources would be less because the callablecapital of Latin debtors is theoretical and does not take placein practice, U.S. officials explained.    In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pctsimple majority voting power over IADB lending.    Initially, the U.S. wanted 65 pct of votes to proceed witha loan, a position that would have given the U.S. a virtualveto since it holds almost 35 pct of the votes.    But it seemed clear from Baker's remarks he was at onepoint ready to concede an increased voting power, such as 62.5pct or 60 pct as the majority for approving loans, that wouldamount to a compromise between the original U.S. and LatinAmerican positions.    Baker said, "In my view, they have not rejected it out ofhand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose toadvance it at the April meeting."    Baker made clear that since Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela andArgentina, representing the Latins, had declined to accept theplan today, the U.S. had reverted to its original position, buthe added, "It's possible the proposal could be revived."    U.S. officials, who asked not to be named, said theybelieved a decision was not forthcoming because several topLatin finance officials were absent from the IADB annualmeetings here.    And one official added that the key Latin officials wouldbe present at the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the WorldBank.    The Treasury Secretary warned that if the issue is leftunresolved "we can't look towards a greater (capital)replenishment here."    That would mean the U.S. would use another multilateraldevelopment bank, like the World Bank, as its principal vehiclefor lending tied to fundamental economic reforms in debtornations.    The IADB has tended to make loans for projects rather thansectoral loans aimed at reforming Latin economies and hence hasnever fully participated in Baker's third world debt plan. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, CHICAGO FUTURES LEADER SAYS MARKETS CAN ADAPT, Foreign currency futuresmarkets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countriesagreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band,said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago MercantileExchange's, CME, executive committee.    "The target zone would not affect our market I think atall.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthymarket," Melamed told Reuters in an interview.    "We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with afour pct shift," he said, referring to permitted currencyfluctuations in the early 1970s. "One thing you can adjust is tomake each contract a larger value."    As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumentalin the development of currency futures, which now are crucialto the Chicago exchange.    Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated canapproach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts bygovernments to control currency fluctuations.    "They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, anhour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it'sunrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary."    The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by theexchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stockindex futures contract to the morning from the afternoon wouldhelp eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equitymarkets on so-called "triple-witching" day.    "We think that the settlement in the morning will have asalutary effect so that over a longer period of time I thinkthis issue (triple witching) will go away because of the changein the structure as of next June," when the move is scheduled togo into effect, he said.    Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by tradersof the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future wouldaddress complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading.    Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barringbrokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their ownaccount. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged indual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades tothe nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups.    The changes "will in time have an extremely positive effecton the marketplace. That's going to prove very, veryinstrumental in increasing volume over time," he said,predicting the increase would come within a year.    Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, saidthe CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limiton the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when theCommodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it couldnot be a temporary program.    The CME also received "many negative comments, many morethan we anticipated," Melamed conceded.

reut2-008.sgm, SPRINT OPTIMISTIC DESPITE LOSSES, US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone ventureof GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT> set uplast June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net lossof about 500 mln dlrs this year.     David M. Holland, president of US Sprint's Dallas-basedSouthwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he didnot know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreedthat for the year the company should have about the sameresults as last year when it lost "about 500 mln dlrs."     He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrsover "two plus years" to set up its network.    Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mlndlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in orderto lease its lines.     He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optictelephone line are now "in the ground," and 7,000 miles areoperable.     By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company'ssubscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (insteadof leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of thesecond quarter.    Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses alongmicroscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and moreeconomical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic linethe diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of informationas a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.     "By the end of the year, we will have the capacity tocarry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls," Hollandsaid.    He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S.long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> about10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.     Holland said Sprint's rates, which were 50 pct lower thanATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephoneexchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all thecompanies have equal access. He said the company was cuttingback its advertising by about 30 pct this year.     At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its totalnumber of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 tolast January.    "We've captured the fiber high ground, shown the importanceof it," he said.     Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said hebelieved ATT "should be given some flexibility, but should beregulated on pricing plans."     "They're so dominant in the market place," he said, addingthat ATT should be deregulated when "there is true competitionin the marketplace."     "It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money," hesaid, adding, "maybe two to four years out, it's hard to say."    Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint'stwo owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, suchas the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure onthem to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.     "They are two excellent partners who have stated time andtime again their support of US Sprint," he said, adding that hewas "amazed" at industry talk that the two companies might bearguing. "There's no evidence of that," he said.     He said Sprint's progress in such areas as revenues,number of customers and construction was on track, even "aheadin many areas."    Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprintcurrently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.    "We want to be in every country that ATT serves," he said.    He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico butwas working on it.     He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, theforerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation's telephonenetwork. Reuter&#3;

Mulroney told delegates to a North American wildlifeconference that he has not been pleased with the U.S.administration's lack of speed in acting on the question, whichCanada sees, he said, "as a test of our relationship" with theU.S.    Mulroney and President Reagan endorsed a report byspecially appointed acid rain envoys last year. Last week, theWhite  House asked Congress for 2.50 billion U.S. dlrs to fundthe acid rain fight.    Mulroney described the commitment as "significant," but notedit was a long time in coming.    "We are geared up, tanked up and raring to go," Mulroneysaid. "But I must tell you we were not happy with the pace withwhich the U.S. administration moved to implement thepresident's acceptance of the envoy report."    The prime minister urged his mostly American audience tohelp Canada take the fight to Congress, saying his governmentis determined to fight on more than one front.    "The campaign does not involve either or choices between theadministration on one hand and Capitol Hill on the other," hesaid.    The Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain hailed Mulroney's callto take the battle to Congress.

reut2-008.sgm, U.K. PROFITTED FROM AUTUMN INTERVENTION - LAWSON, Britain has reaped profits by using astronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government lastautumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellorof the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.    He said in a parliamentary debate, "I can now tell the House(of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reservesin September and October (1986) have subsequently all beenrepurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds."    Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressuresthen for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said.The increase in base rates was instead limited then to onepoint.    During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawsonunveiled last week, he said that "during the period of foreignexchange market turbulence which followed the somewhatinconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at theend of September, I authorised the Bank of England to interveneunusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that wouldenable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct ratherthan the two pct the market was then pressing for."    He said that that one percentage point increase, effectedin October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two halfpoint cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10pct.    Treasury figures show that the underlying change in Britishreserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of Englandintervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that theauthorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September andOctober 1986, government sources said.

The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pctof the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in thenext four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47pct said production would likely remain unchanged.    The CBI said the positive balance between firms expectingproduction to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, wasthe highest such figure recorded since 1977.    In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expecteda rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remainat present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.    The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companiesconsider current order books to be above normal while 58 pctview them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as belownormal.    This was the highest positive balance since the questionwas first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.    In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pctrespectively.    Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Ofall polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books tobe above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.    In February, 25 pct thought their export books were belownormal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct,the proportion of companies rating their export books abovenormal was unchanged between February and March.    On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companiesexpect average prices at which domestic orders are booked willremain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct inFebruary.    From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expectprices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall,against four pct a month earlier.    Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committeechairman David Wigglesworth said sterling's more competitivelevel against many European currencies had improved exports.

Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding buttold journalists the consensus covers the principles involvedin agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done toimprove the global situation in agriculture.    Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally todiscuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launchedin Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.    Yeutter said "at least people seem to be going down the sameroad...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations isanother matter entirely."    There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal withthe problem quickly and "a more common understanding of how weare going to get from here to there," Yeutter said.    However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple ofyears of tough negotiations ahead, he said.    "It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to ploughimmense amounts of financial resources into the production ofitems that nobody wants to buy," he said.    He said the long-term answer is to switch some of thefinancial resources now committed to agriculture to other moreproductive areas. This would help agriculture because some itsinefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, hesaid.    Individual segments in many countries may lose in theprocess, but it should result in a more rational system ofworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach arelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably morethan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,he said.    Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture inthe negotiations, he said "one has to be politicallyrealistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agriculturaltrade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have tobe as part of a larger package." REUTER&#3;

Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits fromoperations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrscompared with 1.23 billion in 1985.    They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain ofabout 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its CathayPacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG> unit last May.    Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.    Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividendfor its "A" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 centsadjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.    Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of thecompany's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits,analysts said.    The company's aviation division consists of its majoritystake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in&lt;Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pctowned by Cathay.    Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuelcosts and greater traffic.    Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before theflotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and hassince slipped to 50.23 pct.    Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profitsrose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.    Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd,estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.    "Much depends on properties," said Measor. "And they did a lotbetter in the second half of the year."    Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned SwireProperties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mlncompared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.    Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrsfor the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for thesame 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to thelow level of completion of new residential flats. The firm'sproperties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residentialdevelopment and two luxury housing projects.    Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats inTaikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs insecond-half 1986.    During the year property prices continued to rise as morepeople bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates,analysts said.    "At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were sellingat 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a yearago," said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.)Ltd.    Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex inthe central business district of Hong Kong but it will notprovide income until the first stage is completed next year.    The company also sold three properties and a part interestin a proposed hotel development, which should result inextraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to JamesCapel (Far East) Ltd.    Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expectedto earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping andoffshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

Official figures show the latest level compares with theprevious record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26billion in late March 1986.    Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters theincrease in reserves was the result of heavy intervention bythe bank on the local interbank market. It bought nearly twobillion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said.    Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Councilfor Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the risingreserves were "a big headache for Taiwan."    He said the government expects heavier pressure from theU.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed againstnations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluseswith the U.S.    Wang said the government would launch new measures withinthe next two months to further reduce import tariffs and openthe market wider to foreign products, especially those from theU.S.    Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan's tradesurplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first twomonths of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pctof the surplus was with the U.S.    Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang'sremarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism wererunning out of time. "We must do it quickly or face retaliationfrom Washington," he said.    He said the measures would include removal of tradebarriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies.    Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buyingU.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fearthe strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses.    He said the bank is studying revision of the foreignexchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls,but declined to give details.    The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S.Dollar since September 1985.

reut2-008.sgm, AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES TARGETED OIL TAX STRATEGY, Australia's crudeoil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of atargeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resourcesand Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.    He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association(APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing apackage that would recognise the government's economicpriorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.    Evans was referring to a nearly completed government reviewof oil taxation.    Evans said there were plenty of examples where targetedapproaches to oil industry taxation had produced good resultsin recent years.    These include the reduction in the top marginal crudeexcise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshoreoil announced last September, he said.    The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for theelimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boostincentives for prospecting against a background of weak pricesand Australia's relatively low exploration levels.    "While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity toan already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favourthese kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may stillleave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies aregoing to do in major areas," Evans said.    He said the government did not intend to change itsresource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now beforeparliament, in response to industry calls to allow allexploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.    As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited tohighly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after acertain rate of return has been achieved for individualprojects.    APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax becauseexploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.    Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based morethan anything on the government's desire to ensure thecertainty and stability of the new regime, adding that majorinvestments have already been planned on the existing groundrules.

Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerialtalks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasingbecause the multilateral system is inefficient.    "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATTround," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateralirritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateralsolutions to some of these problems."    The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Puntadel Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and serviceswere included in the negotiations for the first time.    The growing debt burden of Latin American and Africannations will also provide impetus for the GATT round tosucceed, he said.    "Clearly those countries need to develop their exportendeavours and they need open markets for that to happen andthat's the basic objective of the new GATT round," he said.    But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. Itwill not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.    "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint becausethese debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"he said.    "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT roundas a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or makingpossible debt amortisation in the future," he said. REUTER&#3;

A 26.25mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after avery disappointing year.    "A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a verymeagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation ofaround 10 pct," he said.    Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance ondownstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns andthe financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.    Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrsagainst 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government tomove quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation.    "It is just as important for Australia to maintain afinancially healthy, technically advanced refining andmarketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration andproduction," he said.    "The Australian oil industry has the experience and thecapacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if thegovernment would stop putting roadblocks in our way," he said.    Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years toupgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but furtherinvestment required an appropriate rate of return, he said.

reut2-008.sgm, SUPERCONDUCTOR RESEARCH MAY BOOST TOKYO STOCKS, Research into materials that conductelectricity with minimal resistance could lead to further gainson Tokyo's booming stock market, brokers said.    They said the share prices of companies likely to benefitfrom the so-called 'superconductors' rose sharply last weekafter publication of articles about the research in theeconomic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun. The companies were in thenon-ferrous metal, electrical and mining sectors.    But industry analysts said development problems remain andcommercial application is still some years away.    "The area clearly has significant applications but it won'tbe commercially viable for a few years," said Thomas Murtha,technology analyst with James Capel and Co.    Industry analysts said the use of superconductors couldbring sharp cuts in electricity costs if present problems canbe overcome.    Nikko Securities Co Ltd analyst Shinichi Nakayama saidsuperconductors could have applications in computer circuitry,electricity generation and storage, and scientific research.    The superconductors are made of a blend of metals fused ina heat-firing process similar to that used in ceramics.    Nakayama said Kawasaki Steel Corp &lt;KAWS.T> predicted in anin-house study that by 1990 the worldwide market would be worth150 billion yen for superconductors used in computers, 50billion for those used in electricity generators and 150billion for those used in electricity storage.    The study said that by 1995 there would be trains capableof 500 km an hour, hovering on a magnetic field and poweredmainly by superconductors. One hundred billion yen worth ofsuperconducting material would be needed for such a train.    The Kawasaki study also said superconductors would be usedin nuclear fusion physics, but not until the year 2000.    Industry analysts said superconductors have no commercialapplications at present. In laboratory tests the conductor mustbe cooled by expensive liquid helium or hydrogen before minimumelectrical resistance is achieved, though liquid nitrogen,which is much less expensive, has recently also been usedsuccessfully, they said.    Despite this, investors on Tokyo's stock market haveboosted shares of firms related to superconducting materials.    From the close of trading on March 17 until yesterday'sclose, Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Co Ltd's &lt;MIMI.T> shareprice rose 140 yen to 485 yen.

At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade andIndustry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calmU.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practicesin semiconductors.    Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduledmeeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Councilto consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pactwith the U.S.    That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations,calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world marketsand to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.    Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to liveup to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.    Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage thepact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting outJapan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.    In his letter, the contents of which were released today,Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of Marchshowed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate pricesin Asian markets.    In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITIvice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggestedthe two countries could conduct a joint investigation intoallegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise theeconomy and deregulate trade policy.    Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year whichcut the value of its crude exports in half, is the ThirdWorld's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrsfrom the World Bank in the past 20 years.    Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, wasprepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust tolower oil and primary commodity prices.    "We are prepared to support those steps which we believe areconsistent with the development of the Indonesian economy," hesaid.    He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after lastyear's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of thedifficulties now faced by other countries.    Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against thedollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, andhas announced a series of measures since May intended tostimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalisethe economy.    However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plasticsand high tariff barriers remain in place.

A statement by Williams said it was confident of the meritsof the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care topropose from the outset the right terms, including a full cashalternative.    The offer will include a partial convertible alternativeunder which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of theirordinary share allocations.    The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers oneWilliams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for avalue of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.    Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.    Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating inthe market for several months, dealers said. Initially itcentred on &lt;Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, thenswitched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.    Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks withNorcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros whichreplied that any benefits that could be achieved could alsoresult from normal trading.    In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a risein pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnoverthat lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln    Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had amarket capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series ofacquisitions in the next four years has pushed itscapitalisation up to around 380 mln.    The convertible offer would be on the basis of fourWilliams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p ashare. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of400.2p a share.    The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share pricedown to 733p from last night's close at 750p.

reut2-008.sgm, DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER, The dollar is expected to decline furtherin coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness oflast month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,senior foreign exchange dealers said.    Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealerssaid they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month'saccord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing thedollar down, the dealers said.    "The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerthat the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for majorcurrencies has cast a shadow on the agreement," said KojiKidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasurydivision.    He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention ofintervening to support the currency.    "This eliminated the widespread market caution againstpossible joint central bank intervention," Kidokoro said.    Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downwardmomentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardlycontain a further slide in the currency.    They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollarsthrough the U.S. Central bank in New York.    Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reservewould intervene on its own account to support the dollar, butsome said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148yen.    "If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce theflow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which theAmericans don't want," said Haruya Uehara, chief money marketmanager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.    He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next monthwhen corporations reduce their dollar sales after they closetheir books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.    But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollarremained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance ofthe U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit andJapanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.    "The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia instimulating its economy," said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistantgeneral manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's internationaltreasury division.    In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package ofeconomic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, toboost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce itstrade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate onthe budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott ofparliamentary business over the proposed introduction of asales tax.    In the circumstances the government had only a slim chanceof producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.    Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate theJapanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congresswould grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN, The council of theAustralian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said itwill press on with its campaign for major improvements toAustralia's petroleum taxation structure.    The council said in a statement the industry was bitterlydisappointed by the Australian government's position ontaxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and EnergyMinister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.    As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to targetany tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach tosecondary taxation of petroleum.    APEA had expected the government to make positive responsesto detailed industry submissions seeking the removal ofexisting secondary tax disincentives to exploration anddevelopment, the council said.    It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised byEvans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceedwith the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.    Evans told the conference the government did not plan toaccept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allowdeductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.    "The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction ofunsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshorearea in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax isprofit based," the APEA council said.    The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oilexploration companies that it had realistic answers to theindustry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry'sproblems, the council said.    The industry has called for the end of all discriminatorysecondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as majordisincentives at a time of low oil prices. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, CHINA EXPECTED TO SHOW BIG 1986 BUDGET DEFICIT, China's Finance Minister Wang Bingqianwill report a 1986 budget deficit of up to nine billion yuanand prescribe austerity measures for 1987 in a budget speech onThursday, foreign bankers and diplomats told Reuters.    Chinese officials have said the 1986 deficit is "severalbillion," after a surplus of 2.82 billion in 1985 which followedsix years of deficits, including a record 17 billion yuanshortfall in 1979. They have not given an exact figure.    The officials blamed the deficit on excessive investment infixed assets and consumer demand, a drop in efficiency in statefirms, a trade deficit and lower income from import duties.    "China needs a nationwide campaign to increase productionwhile cutting expenditure," the official Peking Review said inan editorial yesterday.    "China should institute means for the effective control ofthe macro-economy and the invigoration of enterprises, largerones in particular, by emphasising quality, efficiency andreduced consumption," it said.    Only by such measures, the magazine said, "can an overallsupply-demand balance in society be secured and the economydevelop steadily over a long period."    A Western diplomat said major factors for the deficit,which he estimated at up to nine billion yuan, were a drop inefficiency and wage rises in state firms, whose profits andtaxes account for a substantial part of national revenue.    The State Statistical Bureau (SSB) last month said profitsand taxes of state firms in 1986 fell 0.2 pct from 1985 to119.3 billion yuan, while production costs were over budget,losses rose and product quality was unstable.    The SSB said profits in most state firms fell because ofbad management and rapid changes in external conditions.    "For some materials, state firms have to compete on the freemarket, where prices are up to double those for materials theybuy under fixed quota from the state," the diplomat said.    "The firms are not subject to proper market discipline,because they cannot go bankrupt, do not have to repay bankloans and have to employ workers whether or not they need them.Under these conditions, they cannot properly adjust to theeconomic levers the state is introducing," he said.    Another diplomat said Wang's major problem is excess demandin the economy, caused by wage increases well ahead ofindustrial growth, and excess growth in capital construction.    "He must dampen this growth through raising taxes or cuttinggovernment expenditure," he said. "China's economy is inherentlyunstable, either in a high or a trough."    He said Wang will reaffirm themes repeated by leaders sincethe start of the year -- thrift, improved efficiency, cuttinginvestment outside the state plan and reducing consumption tobring demand and supply into balance.    "There will be no surprises," the diplomat said.    The first diplomat said one sign of the thrifty times wasthe lack of a banquet during a visit he made to a major Chineseindustrial city.    "Normally, a foreign guest's visit is a chance for the boysto feast on Mao Tai (a strong liquor), turtle and sea slugs,with one banquet given by them and one given in return by me.But there was none on this visit," he said.    He added economic reforms will slow this year, inparticular price changes and the issuing of shares, which raisesensitive issues about ownership and ideology. Bond issuesraise no such dilemmas and will continue, he added.    A North American banker, who estimated the deficit at abouteight billion yuan, said economic policy has been affected by anational drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase meaningWestern political ideas.    "In China the political system dictates economic policy," hesaid. "The large deficit gives the conservatives a stick to beatthe reformers and demand more economic austerity.    "One of China's top economic policy makers told me this week1987 will be a year of consolidation for his firm, with lessoverseas investment, lower imports and new funding to besourced internally."    The banker said he is more comfortable about China'sstability now than two months ago, when the drive was launchedafter the resignation of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.    "There is no leftist alternative to the reforms," he said."There is no going back to the policy of strict central control.But the reforms will take years. What you have now is aconfused mix of control and market economies." REUTER&#3;

The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage housesis likely to pay off in dollars and international marketposition, they said. "It's part of a trend towards growingcapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreignfinancial institutions," said Simon Smithson, an analyst withKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm describedby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will giveNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions onWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of itsassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in businesssectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory assetmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing.    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and theworld's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve thedeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese lifeinsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japaneseinsurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocksand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets andinstruments.

Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller andproblem-plagued banks in 1984. "But now Japanese are going forblue-chip organisations," he said.    "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturingindustries," said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. "With ahistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."    Competition in fund management has grown along with greaterJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mlnyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17to 18 pct, he said.    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas andgain experience with financial instruments which are likely tospread to Japan with further deregulation. "The high regulatoryenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms')diversification. Now there's a growing number of new productsin an environment of increasing competition for performance onfund management," Smithson said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL, Leading Australian onshore oil and gasproducer, Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hitby sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate andliquefied petroleum gas (LPG).    The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in netprofit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.    Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statementthat increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, alongwith reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oilexploration and development outlays, were helping Santos dealwith an adverse business climate.    Santos said it remained financially strong with aninjection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at theend of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.    It said it had also made significant progress in repayingdebts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' fundshad fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.    Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bidfor the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gascompany &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mlndlrs.    Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollardenominated and significant currency purchases were made duringthe year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.    Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program,finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oilexploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added toreserves -- less than depletion during the year.    Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year schemeto double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget foroil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.    Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices andproduction volumes but with extra oil exploration andencouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.    But it called on the goverment to continue fosteringdomestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.    "It makes no sense to abandon this policy now whenexploration is at its lowest level for many years and whenAustralia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,"Massy-Green said.

reut2-008.sgm, INDONESIAN BANKS PROFITS RISE AFTER DEVALUATION, Indonesia's September devaluationhelped bank profits to rise by 28.6 pct in calendar 1986, butdespite higher world oil prices, banks are likely to seeprofits stabilise or fall in 1987, the head of Indonesia'sAssociation of Private Banks told Reuters.    Association chairman Nyoman Muna said in an interview thatmost banks made windfall profits from the 31 pct devaluationagainst the U.S. Dollar.    He saw the outlook for 1987 as more favourable forIndonesia, with oil prices now around 18 dlrs a barrel.    But he forecast that overall bank profits would probablyfall slightly from 1986 pre-tax levels, which he said wereartificially high due to the devaluation.    The Association's latest report on the performance ofIndonesia's 112 state, foreign and private banks shows thatoverall profits rose in 1986 to 495 billion rupiah from 385billion in 1985.    This was after a fall in first half profits to 202.9billion rupiah, from 238.1 billion in January-June 1985.    The report shows foreign bank profits slumped in 1986,mostly due to a loss by Bank of America NT and SA.    Bank of America, a branch of BankAmerica Corp &lt;BAC.N>, wasaffected by a string of bad debts and other problems during theyear. It showed a loss of 32.03 billion rupiah, against a lossof 3.48 billion in 1985, and 1984 profit of 7.25 billion.    A bank spokesman told Reuters he believed Bank of Americain Jakarta was now back on track. "The worst is behind us."    Its assets have fallen to 194.07 billion rupiah in 1986from 293 billion in 1985 and 301.5 billion at the end of 1984.    Indonesian profits of the 11 foreign banks allowed tooperate in Jakarta fell to 6.58 billion rupiah from 39.2billion in 1985, the report said.    These profits do not include offshore loans, which arehandled through other centres but which account for most of theforeign banks' business.    Profits of Indonesia's seven key state banks, which accountfor more than 80 pct of domestic banking assets, rose sharplyto 319.09 billion rupiah in 1986 from 212.0 billion.    Total assets of the seven rose to 40,232 billion from31,288 billion rupiah, the report said.    Profits of BNI 1946, the largest of the seven, rose to63.28 billion rupiah from 35.9 billion in 1985.    Its total assets expanded to 12,115 billion from 8,552billion at the end of December 1985.    Muna said in the fiscal year starting April 1, budgetedgovernment spending will fall in real terms. Many ministrieshave had budgets cut severely due to declining oil revenues.    "This will naturally have its impact on the banking sector,"Muna stated. "But I think that with oil around 18 dlrs, thegeneral performance of the banking sector will not be too bad."    Western bankers said the capital market remained sluggish,but Indonesia was using more foreign loans.    Bank of Tokyo &lt;BTOK.T>, the only Japanese bank allowed tooperate here, almost doubled its assets in 1986 to 607 billionrupiah from 335 billion in 1985, the report showed. But itsprofit was barely higher at 8.5 billion from 8.4 billion.    Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N> local unit Citibank, previously listedas the largest foreign bank, slipped to second place behindBank of Tokyo. It recorded a loss of 480 mln rupiah against a1985 profit of 11.9 billion.    A Citibank spokesman told Reuters the loss was abook-keeping issue and did not represent the true picture, butdeclined to give further figures.    One western banker said that "Citibank is still definitelythe largest foreign operation in Jakarta, whether or not itsprofit figures show it."    Bank of Tokyo and Citibank ranked 10th and 11th in terms ofassets of all banks in Indonesia.    The government allows only 11 foreign banks to conduct fullbanking operations, and restricts their business to Jakarta. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN, Canadian Trade Minister PatCarney said that agricultural policies should not hurt worldinternational trade and should therefore become more priceresponsive over time.    She told delegates at the informal meeting of tradeministers that this was one of five principles Canada wantedadopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agricultureshould avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countriesshould freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures thatdistorted world prices, Carney said.    Carney said the fourth principle was that countries shouldnot introduce new import barriers not mandated by existinglegislation and the fifth was that these basic principles mustbe implemented collectively.    Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines arebasically compatible with the seven point Australian proposalsannounced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.    European trade sources said the conference welcomed theCanadian initiative but some delegates, and not only theEuropean Community, voiced reservations about some of theprinciples.    Carney said there was a lot of political will among theministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in underfour years and that there is also a realisation that it has tobe done in a balanced way.    "The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on abroad front and see what areas emerge where we can get earlyconclusion," she said.    However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are,Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral tradenegotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form byOctober, are progressing well. REUTER&#3;

Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informalGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gaveministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examineissues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.    "Also, the role of the developing countries has beenemphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been theperception of developing countries that GATT is a club of richcountries," he added in an interview with Reuters.    "In fact many of the issues that have been tabled fordiscussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will beof more benefit to the developed countries," he said.    Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that theUruguay round was meant to be a "shining act of faith" in theworld trade system.    Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues oftrade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machineryto make it more responsive.    He said tropical fruit came from developing countries butfaced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or veryhigh duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and SouthKorea as examples.

Banks are being invited to join at four mln stg for 50basis points and at 2.5 mln stg for 40 basis points.    The terms represent an improvement over those obtained lastyear, when Barbados tapped the market for a 25 mln dlrtransferable loan facility, which carried the same maturity buthad interest at 1-1/4 pct over Libor. The facility wassubsequently increased to 40 mln dlrs.    However, the loan was not signed until November 5, andbankers said that this year Barbados wanted to have thefinancing in place early to give it greater flexibility indrawing the funds over the course of the year.    Last year Barbados boosted its capital market borrowingswith a small private yen placement in the Japanese market.

The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pctof the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in thenext four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47pct said production would likely remain unchanged.    The CBI said the positive balance between firms expectingproduction to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, wasthe highest such figure recorded since 1977.    In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expecteda rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remainat present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.    The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companiesconsider current order books to be above normal while 58 pctview them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as belownormal.    This was the highest positive balance since the questionwas first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.    In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pctrespectively.    Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Ofall polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books tobe above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.    In February, 25 pct thought their export books were belownormal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct,the proportion of companies rating their export books abovenormal was unchanged between February and March.

reut2-008.sgm, YEUTTER SEES GATT CONSENSUS ON FARM TRADE REFORM, U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reacheda general consensus on agricultural trade reform under thelatest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT).    Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding buttold journalists the consensus covers the principles involvedin agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done toimprove the global situation in agriculture.    Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally todiscuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launchedin Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.    Yeutter said "at least people seem to be going down the sameroad...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations isanother matter entirely."    There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal withthe problem quickly and "a more common understanding of how weare going to get from here to there," Yeutter said.    However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple ofyears of tough negotiations ahead, he said.    "It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to ploughimmense amounts of financial resources into the production ofitems that nobody wants to buy," he said.    He said the long-term answer is to switch some of thefinancial resources now committed to agriculture to other moreproductive areas. This would help agriculture because some itsinefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, hesaid.    Individual segments in many countries may lose in theprocess, but it should result in a more rational system ofworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach arelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably morethan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,he said.    Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture inthe negotiations, he said "one has to be politicallyrealistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agriculturaltrade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have tobe as part of a larger package." REUTER&#3;

At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade andIndustry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calmU.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practicesin semiconductors.    Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduledmeeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Councilto consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pactwith the U.S.    That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations,calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world marketsand to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.    Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to liveup to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.    Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage thepact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting outJapan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.    In his letter, the contents of which were released today,Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of Marchshowed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate pricesin Asian markets.    In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITIvice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggestedthe two countries could conduct a joint investigation intoallegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

reut2-008.sgm, DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER, The dollar is expected to decline furtherin coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness oflast month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,senior foreign exchange dealers said.    Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealerssaid they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month'saccord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing thedollar down, the dealers said.    "The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerthat the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for majorcurrencies has cast a shadow on the agreement," said KojiKidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasurydivision.    He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention ofintervening to support the currency.    "This eliminated the widespread market caution againstpossible joint central bank intervention," Kidokoro said.    Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downwardmomentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardlycontain a further slide in the currency.    They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollarsthrough the U.S. Central bank in New York.    Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reservewould intervene on its own account to support the dollar, butsome said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148yen.    "If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce theflow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which theAmericans don't want," said Haruya Uehara, chief money marketmanager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.    He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next monthwhen corporations reduce their dollar sales after they closetheir books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.    But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollarremained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance ofthe U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit andJapanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.    "The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia instimulating its economy," said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistantgeneral manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's internationaltreasury division.    In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package ofeconomic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, toboost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce itstrade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate onthe budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott ofparliamentary business over the proposed introduction of asales tax.    In the circumstances the government had only a slim chanceof producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.    Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate theJapanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congresswould grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND, Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlrpurchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Incbrokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurersare likely to follow, securities analysts said.    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage housesis likely to pay off in dollars and international marketposition, they said. "It's part of a trend towards growingcapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreignfinancial institutions," said Simon Smithson, an analyst withKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm describedby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will giveNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions onWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of itsassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in businesssectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory assetmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing.    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and theworld's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve thedeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese lifeinsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japaneseinsurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocksand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets andinstruments.    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official wasappointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co'sboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become alimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller andproblem-plagued banks in 1984. "But now Japanese are going forblue-chip organisations," he said.    "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturingindustries," said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. "With ahistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."    Competition in fund management has grown along with greaterJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mlnyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17to 18 pct, he said.    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas andgain experience with financial instruments which are likely tospread to Japan with further deregulation. "The high regulatoryenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms')diversification. Now there's a growing number of new productsin an environment of increasing competition for performance onfund management," Smithson said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN, Canadian Trade Minister PatCarney said that agricultural policies should not hurt worldinternational trade and should therefore become more priceresponsive over time.    She told delegates at the informal meeting of tradeministers that this was one of five principles Canada wantedadopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agricultureshould avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countriesshould freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures thatdistorted world prices, Carney said.    Carney said the fourth principle was that countries shouldnot introduce new import barriers not mandated by existinglegislation and the fifth was that these basic principles mustbe implemented collectively.    Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines arebasically compatible with the seven point Australian proposalsannounced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.    European trade sources said the conference welcomed theCanadian initiative but some delegates, and not only theEuropean Community, voiced reservations about some of theprinciples.    Carney said there was a lot of political will among theministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in underfour years and that there is also a realisation that it has tobe done in a balanced way.    "The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on abroad front and see what areas emerge where we can get earlyconclusion," she said.    However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are,Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral tradenegotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form byOctober, are progressing well. REUTER&#3;

The sources said Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin made theproposal to a 12-bank advisory committee, chaired byManufacturers Hanover Trust Co as the talks entered theirfourth week in New York.    They said the Philippines was now willing to pay a spreadof 7/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates(Libor), up from the 5/8 points it originally proposed.    The sources said the proposal was made in a bid to break adeadlock with the banks, who were insisting on a minimuminterest spread of one full percentage point over Libor.    They noted that the latest plan marked a compromise betweenthe two sides' demands, but fell short of Ongpin's assertionthat the Philippines would insist on a deal better than the13/16 percentage points offered to Mexico last year by itscreditor banks.

But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on theyen's exchange rate trend in the immediate future, Agencyofficials said.    The officials told reporters industrial production, down0.5 pct in January from December, is likely to turn positive inFebruary and to rise thereafter, raising hopes for a brightereconomic outlook.    The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 2.5pct in the current January/March quarter after falling 0.7 pctin the previous quarter.    A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourthquarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 2.7 pct, theofficials said.    They also said an expected upturn in exports would be amixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth butwould increase the chance of trade friction.    Japanese exports contracted five pct in February fromJanuary but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizesaround current levels, the officials said.

Reagan administration officials said later that Washingtondid not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would notlet Iran use Chinese-made "Silkworm" anti-ship missiles, capableof covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oilshipments to the West.

While some said the West German central bank would supportthe dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said theBundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marksor if the decline accelerated.    The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when thedollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks.    "The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment," onedealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks andgovernments was easier said than done.    Some said Baker's remarks and U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on theverge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift.    "It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands," adealer said. Another added, "If the Americans do not get whatthey want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6."    Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success forthe Paris agreement in its latest investment letter.    "It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing orable to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset thenecessary U.S. Fiscal contraction," Citibank said.    It added, "Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marksis not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marksor even less is expected this year."    And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987economic report, "We are looking for a further, more gradual,fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year."    But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still inforce was not universal. Some dealers said not too much shouldbe read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments.    "There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has brokendown," a senior dealer said. REUTER&#3;

Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and havebeen increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds,the spokesman said.    He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could risefurther if money supply growth rose above this year's eight pcttarget for M-4, defined as liquid assets in public hands.    Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct lastmonth against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986.    A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applyinga more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation.    The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year.    "Money supply control is the government's chief weaponagainst inflation," he said. "The problem is higher rates areattracting liquidity from abroad."    He said this was why the central bank enacted specificmeasures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank ofSpain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirementon new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curbshort-term speculative capital from abroad. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS: U.S., A successful new GATT(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed tohalt growing bilateral trade problems between major tradingpartners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said.    Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerialtalks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasingbecause the multilateral system is inefficient.    "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATTround," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateralirritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateralsolutions to some of these problems."    The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Puntadel Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and serviceswere included in the negotiations for the first time.    The growing debt burden of Latin American and Africannations will also provide impetus for the GATT round tosucceed, he said. "Clearly those countries need to develop theirexport endeavours and they need open markets for that to happenand that's the basic objective of the new GATT round."    But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. Itwill not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries,but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.    "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint becausethese debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,"he said.    "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT roundas a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or makingpossible debt amortisation in the future," he said. Reuter&#3;

A national seamen's strike which began on February 27 isstill continuing, despite a partial return to work.    A spokesman at the bankworkers' national strikeheadquarters in Sao Paulo, Lucio Cesar Pires, told Reuters thatabout 500,000 of Brazil's 700,000 bankworkers were on strike.    He said that many private banks were working, particularlyin Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.    The bankworkers, one of the best-organized sectors ofBrazil's labour force, are striking for a 110 pct pay rise.    Pires said the strike had closed the state-controlled Bancodo Brasil, which has more than 3,000 branches.    Brazil's current labour troubles stems from the collapse ofthe government's price freeze and the return of high inflation.    According to official figures, prices rose by 33 pct injust the first two months of the year.

reut2-008.sgm, HUNGARY DETAILS TAX REFORMS FOR 1988, Value added tax (VAT) and personalincome tax are to be introduced next year, alongside pricereform and a modified wage system, the official Hungarian newsagency MTI said in its Weekly Bulletin.    A draft act divides goods into three groups for VAT. Mostwill be taxed at 20 pct, although basic foods, urban transport,fuel, pharmaceuticals and probably homes and building materialswill be zero-rated. Non-basic services will be taxed at 10 pct.    Several other taxes will be abolished when VAT comes innext January 1 and the effect will be to cut producer prices bybetween five and 10 pct, MTI said.    Consumer prices will rise by about eight pct as result ofcuts in subsidies, including those on milk and dairy products,MTI said. It did not say what effect the VAT would have.    Basic changes in company taxation were necessary as varyingtaxes and subsidies gave a confusing picture, and minor stepstaken so far had only improved things temporarily.    MTI said inefficient firms were still being maintained atthe expense of efficient ones, whose profit incentive wasblunted by an average profit tax of 80 pct. The idea was togive all ventures equal chances and eliminate distinctions.    "Valid preferences or supports are to be withdrawn, or atleast reduced," MTI said.    The tax changes will be a further step in a recent line ofeconomic reforms designed to boost company efficiency.    Management of 75 pct of all state enterprises passed fromministries to elected enterprise councils in 1985 and 1986, anda bankruptcy law in force since last September limits the dutyof the state to save loss-making firms.    MTI said yesterday state subsidies to enterprises andindustrial cooperatives rose 16 pct last year, while profitsrose 4.6 pct. It gave no absolute figures.    The number of small private ventures rose 4,000 to 39,000in 1986. Their turnover rose 27.5 pct and net income 16.2 pct.They now employ 443,000, nine pct of the workforce.    Hungarians now pay no tax on their primary income, andrelaxation of central economic controls has led to largedisparities in earnings, almost entirely in the private sector.    MTI said the introduction of personal income tax for allworkers would lead to a fairer bearing of the public burden. Itgave no details of the tax structure except to say that itwould be progressive and embrace all legal income.    All measures are due to go before parliament this summer. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, U.S. ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH, The U.S. economy is showing somepromising signs of accelerated expansion despite thesluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, privateeconomists say.    Some of the slowness experienced in the October-Decemberperiod had been expected to spill over into the first quarterthis year, as the tax law changes that went into effect inJanuary slowed business and consumer spending.    But some of the latest economic data show signs ofsurprising strength in the U.S. economy, although someeconomists remain cautious about the outlook.    The Commerce Department reported today that new orders fordurable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pctrise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defensegoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agencysaid.    The February numbers surpassed the expectations of manyfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat toincreases of up to five pct.    The January/February employment statistics suggest theGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth forthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, aneconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.    The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farmjobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain inJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.    The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate ofabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.    Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuildingtheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in thesecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in thesecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumptionand government spending. He also sees residential constructiondeclining mostly for multi-family housing units.    Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of thefourth quarter slowness will continue.    Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in thefirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter andshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.    The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in theU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline inthe dollar's value over the last year and half.    "The improvement will be gradual and long lasting," Levypredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but atleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as theprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.    The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,which soared to record levels last year, will improve this yearand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for theyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.    As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate theirdomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.    U.S. officials believe that would help take some of thepressure off the United States whose five years of economicgrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries.    The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market fortheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed toservice their foreign debt.    The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at amodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.    There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalancebetween the volume of goods imported to the United States andthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume ofexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the factthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsenedduring the closing three months of 1986.    While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporateprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, thegovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measuredby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing amoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.    The government also reported that consumer spending, a keyelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct inFebruary, after falling two pct in January.    The Federal Reserve Board also reported that themanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elementsof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.    In its latest report on current economic conditions, theFed said that economic activity in the various regions of thecountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in mostregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.    Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said thepick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to thedrop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a majorpick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economywill slip into recession either.    He said higher prices on imported products and wage cutsthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeezeconsumers purchasing power.    "That pattern is starting and will continue for a number ofyears," Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering arounda modest two pct level for the next few years. Reuter&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, INDONESIA URGED TO DEREGULATE ITS ECONOMY, World Bank President Barber Conablelinked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World'ssixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade anddismantle protectionist barriers.    "We would like to see the Indonesian government continue theadjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulationof the economy," Conable told a press conference at the end of athree-day visit to Jakarta.    Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia'shard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by thegovernment to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency.    The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlrtrade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend onthe economic policies Indonesia adopted.    But he said that in meetings with both President Suhartoand leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specificpolicy changes.    "The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesiangovernment. We are not here to dictate to them," he stated.    Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badlyhit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenuesfrom crude exports in half.    Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morningwith Suharto.    He voiced support for measures already taken, includingSeptember's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts toderegulate imports and stimulate exports.    "The government can rely on the support of the World Bank ina continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities oftoday's world," he said.

A national seamen's strike which began on February 27 isstill continuing, despite a partial return to work.    A spokesman at the bankworkers' national strikeheadquarters in Sao Paulo, Lucio Cesar Pires, told Reuters thatabout 500,000 of Brazil's 700,000 bankworkers were on strike.    He said that many private banks were working, particularlyin Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.    The bankworkers, one of the best-organized sectors ofBrazil's labour force, are striking for a 100 pct pay rise.    Pires said the strike had closed the state-controlled Bancodo Brasil, which has more than 3,000 branches.    Brazil's current labour troubles stems from the collapse ofthe government's price freeze and the return of high inflation.    According to official figures, prices rose by 33 pct injust the first two months of the year.    Other strikes are being threatened, including nationalstoppages by 450,000 social security workers and 50,000university teachers.    In central Sao Paulo dozens of armed military police stoodguard outside branches of the Banco do Brasil to preempt anymove by bankworkers to occupy the buildings.    A bank official in one foreign bank, which was still openthis morning, said that with the closure of the Banco do Brasilprivate banks would not be able to function much longer.    He said: "If the Banco do Brasil closes it shuts down thewhole system. I think that after lunch we will have to stop."    Groups of strikers marched in the central commercialdistrict, waving banners and stopping outside private banks tochant slogans.    Pires said the strike call had been largely ignored byworkers in the private banks, with many branches openparticularly in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre.    Television reports said that in the southern state ofParana farmers protesting against high interest rates supportedthe bankworkers.    As they have done many times over the past few weeks, theyblockaded the entrances of private banks with farm machinery. Reuter&#3;

He told a press conference before leaving for Tokyo thatIndonesia's rising debt-service ratio was a problem and causefor concern. But he said it was not necessarily due toimprudent borrowing and "it is still within an area of beingmanageable."    The bank estimates Indonesia has total foreign debts ofaround 37 billion dlrs. The debt service ratio has risen to aprojected 33 pct for fiscal 1987/88, from 25 pct in 1986/87ending March 31.    Anything above 20 pct is considered high by bankers.    Conable said the decline in world oil prices and the risein the value of the Japanese yen had increased the ratio byreducing Indonesian exports and raising its debt repayments.    Indonesian debt servicing of 6,760 billion rupiah takes upalmost one third of the 1987/88 budget.    Payment on the principal of government debts is officiallyprojected at 2.73 billion dlrs in 1987/88 against 2.11 billionin 1986/87.

Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at abreakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan fora 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was "heavy and strong"largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry couldeventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as theagriculture industry.    Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industrywere issued last week after the Department of Energy released acomprehensive report finding U.S. national security could bejeopardized by rising oil imports.

reut2-008.sgm, PHILIPPINE CENTRAL BANKER FACES CORRUPTION CHARGES, A government-appointed specialprosecutor has ordered the filing of corruption charges overthe closure of a private bank against Philippine central bankgovernor Jose Fernandez, who said he would contest the charges.    Ombudsman Raul Gonzalez told Reuters there was evidence toindicate that Fernandez had misused his office in ordering theclosure of &lt;Pacific Banking Corp> in July, 1985.    He said the charges against Fernandez would be filed "withinthe week" in a special court for corruption cases, adding that adefendant could appeal against a ruling in the Supreme Court.    Fernandez is in New York for talks with the Philippines'creditor banks on rescheduling about 9.4 billion dlrs of thecountry's foreign debt.    A central bank statement quoted Fernandez as saying PacificBank's closure and sale were in accordance with law.    "Fernandez said that some points may have been missed in theappreciation of the case for which reason he will be filing amotion for reconsideration of the (Ombudsman's) resolution," thestatement said.    Central bank sources said the statement was drafted afterFernandez and senior deputy governor Gabriel Singson, who is inManila, conferred on the telephone.    Gonzalez said his office ordered the charges filed afterhearing submissions by Fernandez and plaintiff Paula Paug, thepresident of Pacific Bank's Employees Union.    In her complaint, Paug said Fernandez had acted arbitrarilyin ordering the closure of Pacific Bank and placing it underreceivership without giving the bank the right to appeal,throwing hundreds of employees out of work.    Paug also said Fernandez had not withdrawn his stockholdingin Far East Bank and Trust Company, which took over PacificBank's assets, when he became central bank governor in January,1984. Fernandez founded Far East in 1960.    She alleged Fernandez had misused his position byappointing two Far East bank executives to central bankconsultancies, giving them access to Pacific Bank records. Shealso disputed Fernandez' interpretation of Pacific's accountsfrom January 1980 to May 1985, claiming the bank had made aprofit, not a loss.    The central bank statement quoted Fernandez as stressingthat Pacific Bank was "repeatedly given notice of the continuinglosses of the bank and the immediate need of putting upadditional capital to eliminate insolvency."    It said the central bank tried to assist in a bid by Bankof Hawaii and Philippine sugar trader Antonio Chan to purchasePacific Bank, but the negotiations collapsed "because of certainlegal impediments."    The statement said the central bank invited several banksto submit offers for Pacific, and the sale to Far East wasapproved by the Monetary Board and not by Fernandez alone.    Fernandez was also quoted in the statement as saying he haddivested himself of all interests in Far East Bank when hebecame central bank governor. A Far East Bank spokesmandeclined comment on the charges against Fernandez.    In a footnote to a 12-page resolution recommendingprosecution against Fernandez, Gonzalez said prima facieevidence of misuse of power also existed against all the thenmembers of the country's Monetary Board, as well as the FarEast executives, and ordered their investigation.    He said Fernandez's action fitted in with the politicalclimate during former President Ferdinand Marcos's final years.    "(The) prevailing mood of the day for those in high officeswas either to imitate the penchant of then President Marcos andhis wife, to run roughshod over the human rights of citizens... Or to follow blindly or with canine devotion anyinstructions from above," Gonzalez wrote.    Gonzalez, named to his post 11 months ago, said his officehad received more than 4,000 complaints of misuse of power. Hesaid among those facing prosecution were five provincialgovernors appointed by President Corazon Aquino. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION, Sudan has rejected a demand by theInternational Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation becausesuch a move would have a negative impact on its economy, theofficial Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported.    Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said hisgovernment also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidieson basic consumer goods.    SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation,said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoumyesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan.    Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, issome 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared itineligible for fresh loans in February last year.    In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation ofits pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchangerate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency.    Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditorsfor more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluationshad failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices.Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollarfor foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers.    Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollarwas sold at 5.5 pounds today.    With stringent import regulations and the governmentincreasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollarsare used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouringcountries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire.    Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMFand Sudanese government officials do not amount to formaltalks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan'seconomic performance.    The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economicrecovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a seriousattempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuadeits Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears.    This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill ofhealth from the IMF that it could take to Western governmentcreditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, toreschedule debt payments.    Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed tomembers of the Paris Club, the diplomats said.    Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMFrepresentative had told him the fund's executive board was "verypleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the pastcouple of months."    The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing DirectorMichel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudanowes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more.    Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrsbut set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in thefiscal year ending next June 30. REUTER&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, EC COLD AID FOOD SCHEME MAY BE MADE PERMANENT, Emergency action to distributeEuropean Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has provedso successful that the EC executive Commission may propose apermanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said.    Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC storesbetween January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved thescheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.    The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnesof sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, hasbeen distributed to the needy through charities.    The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure tohelp poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winterand will end on March 31.    But the spokesman said the commission will consider whetherto propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.    The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporaryscheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units(72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr)ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.    However, commission sources said the real cost was small ifaccount is taken of the expense of keeping food in store untilits quality and value deteriorates.    On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on ECfood surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks atJanuary 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnesof beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, U.S. COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN EXPLORATION, A unanimous Supreme Court ruled thatoil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off theAlaska coast which were leased by the federal government toeight major oil companies.    The ruling was an important victory for the oil companiesand the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasingprogram and a setback for two small Alaskan villages thatchallenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.    The administration said that the court-ordered halt indrilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paidfor 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.    A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to haltall exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts inthe Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to thesubsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.    But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong inissuing an injunction halting exploration.    "Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration wasnot at all probable," Justice Byron White wrote for the court."And on the other side of the balance of harms was the factthat the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrsto exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 whichthey would have lost without chance of recovery had explorationbeen enjoined," he said.    The oil companies, Amoco Corp &lt;AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp &lt;XON>,Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Union Oil,had said that voiding previously granted leases would result instaggering financial losses.    The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres andgenerated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.    Administration officials, saying the lease sales werepreceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied thatthe oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.    The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with anorganization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued thatthe drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, LOWER TAX OFFSETS LOWER SHELL U.K. UPSTREAM PROFIT, &lt;Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit onexploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil priceslast year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.    But he told a press conference that due to the highmarginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact ofthe drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.    The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, withPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, hesaid.    As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration andproduction sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.    Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/ShellGroup &lt;RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against8.81 mln.    Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oiloutput from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for thecompany. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in thecurrent year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the declinein output from the major Brent field, he said.    Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gasliquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected tobe maintained in 1987, he said.    A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and OspreyNorth Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oilprice fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.    Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider NorthSea fields, which were approved last year, have brought thecost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.    Day to day operating costs of the exploration andproduction sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the targetis to keep costs per barrel constant.    The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading tothe discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early togauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.    Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to aprofit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.    Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit &lt;ShellU.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987were a "bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986."    In November and December in particular, refining operationshad shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oilproduct prices, he said. He expected margins to continuegenerally positive over the summer, although they could dip tobecome negative from time to time, depending on pricemovements.    A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery willnow come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about fivemonths behind schedule, following a crane accident whichseverely damaged the plant last year, he said.    Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemicalsite.    Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by whichcompanies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPRT, was "helpful," but rather less than had been hoped for.    Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was inthe range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, hewould expect some over-production above OPEC"s official 15.8 mlnbpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.    He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrainoutput was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil willfall. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, TALKING POINT/U.S. BROKERAGE FIRMS, Wall Street's biggest brokerage firms,eager for funds and foreign ties to fuel internationalexpansion, are expected to find more partnerships among Japan'scash-rich companies, analysts said.    Yesterday, American Express Co's &lt;AXP> board formallyapproved a linkup with &lt;Nippon Life Insurance Co> for itselfand its &lt;Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc> brokerage unit. NipponLife will receive 13 pct of Shearson for 538 mln dlrs.    Nippon Life's investment in Shearson follows last year'sinvestment by &lt;Sumitomo Bank Ltd> in &lt;Goldman, Sachs and Co>.Sumitomo paid 500 mln dlrs for 12.5 pct of the firm.    "There certainly is potential for additional investment orfurther linkups with other Japanese financial institutions. Ithink the pattern has established itself here, and it'sreasonable to expect further investment down the road," saidPrudential-Bache Securities analyst Larry Eckenfelder.    Speculation of such partnerships spread to other brokeragestocks, resulting in rising stock prices in recent sessions.    "The brokerage industry needs capital and the evolution ofthe value of the yen and the dollar suggests there's going tobe a great deal of investment by Japanese firms in the U.S.,"said another analyst.    As globalization of the financial markets accelerates,Japanese firms are expected to turn their sights on theexpertise of the U.S. brokerage industry.    Competiton to gain a foothold in the important asian marketand Europe has also created a craving for more capital by U.Sfirms.    "Morgan (Stanley), First Boston, Salomon (Brothers),Merrill (Lynch). Those would be the firms more likely toconsider hooking up with a Japanese firm, and those would bethe ones the Japanese would be most interested in," Eckenfeldersaid.    All of those firms, he said, have been establishingthemselves in Japan.    While Wall Street views the investment by Nippon favorably,there is some underlying concern that Japanese companies maylearn enough from their U.S. partners to ultimately pose thesame type of competitive threat they havemade in electronics and automobiles.    "The difficult issue is what investment really will lead toas markets deregulate. Passive investment is an educationgathering period. Obviously, there are regulatory barrierstoward exercising management control," said Samuel Liss, abrokerage industry analyst with Salomon Brothers.    The Nippon purchase of a stake in Shearson must be approvedby U.S. regulators and the Japan Finance Ministry. There willalso be a public offering for 18 pct of Shearson.    Nippon and Shearson have already said they would form ajoint venture company in London to work on investment advisory,asset management, and consulting on financing.    Analysts believe Nippon has willingly paid a premium forits stake, but it will also receive warrants for one mlnAmerican Express shares and the 13 mln shares in Shearson willbe cumulative preferred, convertible to common after U.S.regulatory approval is granted.    American Express has also guaranteed it will retain aminimum of 40 pct of Shearson until 1990.    American Express and Nippon are also expected to workclosely. For instance, analysts expect it to market theAmerican Express card more actively in Japan with the help ofNippon.    "The key to the deal is not just raising capital forShearson, but forming a strategic alliance with Nippon," saidAlan Zimmerman of Kidder, Peabody and Co.    American Express stock responded favorably to theannouncements, climbing 2-1/8 to 79 in active trading today.    Some analysts believe Nippon is also interested in gaininga foothold in the U.S. market with the help of American Expressand Shearson.    Analysts predicted other Japanese insurers may be eager tofollow Nippon Life. U.S. insurers have found numerous partnersthemselves in the brokerage industry.    For instance, Equitable Life Assurance Co owns Donaldson,Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp, and Prudential LifeInsurance Co owns Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    Eckenfelder said Japanese brokerage firms would not belikely acquirors of U.S. firms for the time being, althoughthey have often been rumored suitors in the past. Last year,when Shearson unsuccessfully courted E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH>,Japanese firms were also rumored to be willing partners. Reuter&#3;

Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Hellersaid, "A broadly based commodity price index may be worthexploring" as a guide to monetary policy.    "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy mightbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, monetarypolicy might be eased," he said.    Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurementproblems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give"early warning" signs of wholesale and retail changes.    "There is no need to react to every small fluctuation incommodity prices or to do so on a daily basis," Heller said in aprepared text.    "But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend, a policyaction might be considered," he said.    Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as anindicator for monetary policy would also contribute tostabilized currency exchange rates.    Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and pricesfor them are more consistent than for other types of goods, hesaid.    He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilizeexport commodity prices for developing countries by using acommodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy. Reuter&#3;

But he said he welcomed Mercantile and General tradingprofits in 1986 and was optimistic about both that and theInternational division.

The Group also intended to expand the number of its estateagency firms bought last year, and hoped they will comprisebetween 10 and 15 pct of total company profits in the future.    "We hope they will be very profitable very shortly. We arelooking for profits from the estate agencies themselves as wellas the insurance products associated with them," Corby said.

The agreement was signed by Nigerian Finance Minister ChuOkongwu and the Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD)chief executive Jack Gill.    The Nigerians will go on to Paris for similar bilateraltalks tomorrow with Coface, the French export credit agency.    Today's agreement follows an agreement between Nigeria andthe Paris Club of western creditor governments in December toreschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of official debt.    The Paris Club agreement was for a rescheduling of the 7.5billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between September1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace.    But as with all Paris Club pacts, specific interest ratesand other details have to be negotiated on a bi-lateral basiswith the countries involved. None of the details contained intoday's negotiations was immediately available.    The Nigerians are hoping that further bilateral accords canbe struck fairly soon as this could encourage official exportcredit agencies to renew insurance cover for exports toNigeria.    The ECGD suspended its cover for exports to Nigeria in1983. Despite the success of the talks over the past two days,govenment sources said there had not been any discussions onnew credits.    Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh exportcredits this year from official agencies under a structrualadjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank tosupport a rescheduling of part of the country's 19 billion dlrforeign debt.    But these credits cannot be approved until the exportcredit agencies agree to resume insuring the debts. REUTER&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, DRAWDOWN SEEN IN U.S. DISTILLATE STOCKS, Tonight's American Petroleum Instituteoil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown indistillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for theweek ending March 20, oil analysts and traders said.    They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depletedby about one to four mln barrels.    Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocksunchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others saidstocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughputvolumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher orlower than the week ended March 13, traders said.    The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S.distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another draw reflecting historic seasonal trends.    For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocksdown 2.9 mln barrels.    Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels saidthey are looking for fairly high consumption rates as thespring and summer driving season gets underway this year,because retail prices are still low compared to recent years.    U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrelsfor the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over theoutcome for last week because there is uncertainty aboutwhether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.    Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrelshigher, while others think inventories could be as much as fivemln barrels below the previous week.    The lower estimates are supported by the belief that cruderuns increased and imports fell.    The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the weekended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightlyup or down for the week ended March 20.    Expectations for product stockdraws are already beingreflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are atthe higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effectwill be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor,they said.

reut2-008.sgm, STERLING OUTLOOK CLOUDED BY TEST OF PARIS ACCORD, The move by foreign exchange markets totest the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown intoquestion the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently oneof the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.    Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risensharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.    While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen anddollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention tosterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage ofrelatively high U.K. Interest rates.    But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the firsttentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday.    The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollardown further in a test of the willingness of central banks tointervene. Analysts say if the banks do not interveneeffectively, the Paris accord could collapse.    "On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6collapses," Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.    He said sterling would lose out as markets turned theirattention to capital movements whereas previously they had beenrestricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.    However, although most analysts and foreign exchangedealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation oreven retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharpdrop in the U.K. Currency.    Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K.Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices andrelatively high interest rates, they said.    Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has beenrunning especially high after last week's budget, seen aspopular both with the markets and with British voters.    Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in theWest German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 istrailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.    Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservativeparty ahead of opposition parties in popularity have alsosupported the pound.    In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off twohalf-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less thantwo weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in thenext week or so, has already been largely discounted.    U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are stillrelatively high compared to other western countries, andanalysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikelyto affect sterling.    Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline,dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.    Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchangemarkets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond(gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.    Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market hasbeen one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.    Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steadyfor the next few days while the market awaits furtherdevelopments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Currentaccount figures for February.    Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stgafter January's small surplus. REUTER&#3;

Separately, ATT denied reports that it plans to buy back alarge chunk of its stock. ATT's stock was up 1/4 points at25-1/8 in heavy trading.    The company said it also created a separate 600-member teamthat will educate the computer sales force and its other salesgroups on ATT's computer products. This group, ATT said,reports directly to Vittorio Cassoni, senior vice president ofits computer unit, called the Data Systems division.    Cassoni, speaking at a news conference at which ATTunveiled its most powerful mid-range computer, said the salesgroups will provide a "sharper focus" to ATT's computermarketing efforts.    The executive, hired from Olivetti to bolster ATT'sunsuccessful campaign to become a major vendor of computergear, also said the company is committed to its 3B line ofmid-range computers. He said ATT backed the 3B line despitewidespread criticism throughout the industry that it isinferior to mid-range systems made by International BusinessMachines Corp &lt;IBM>, Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> and others.    Cassoni, however, said ATT would strenghten the 3B linewithin the next three or four months. He said ATT will offernew, more powerful mid-range computers that will protect theinvestments of existing 3B users in ATT hardware and software.    In justifying the company's commitment to the 3B line,which was originally developed for internal use by ATT and itsformer Bell telephone company units, Cassoni pointed to severalrecent sales that he said proved the mid-range line'scommercial viability.    One example he provided was a recent 34 mln dlr deal ATTsigned with the United States Postal Service.    Cassoni also said ATT will announce a new personal computerbased on the powerful 80386 microprocessor from Intel Corp&lt;INTC>.   Compaq Computer Corp &lt;CPQ> is already selling a 386-based PCand IBM is widely expected to announce a 386 machine sometimethis year.   Cassoni said the Data Systems division is unprofitable andthat it will take "a couple of years" for the division to meetits goal of making a "substantial contribution to ATT'searnings stream." But, he added, the division is "approaching"the point where it can start making money.    Cassoni said the new products introduced today are "a verysignificant step to foster our efforts in the computerbusiness."    Among the new offerings is the 3B2/600 minicomputer, whichATT said can provide up to four times the processing power ofthe 3B2/400, previously its biggest computer.    But with a top speed of 4.0 mips, or million instructionsper second, the top-of-line 3B cannot match the computing powerof rival systems from IBM and DEC. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, SOUTH AFRICA/BANKS AGREE ON DEBT REPAYMENT PLAN, South Africa will repay 13 pct of itsfrozen 13 billion dollar debt to foreign creditors over thenext three years under an agreement reached today in London,Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said.    He said South Africa already had repaid five pct of thedebt under the standstill agreement expiring on June 30, 1987.   "These arrangements confirm South Africa's continuedwillingness to maintain good relations with its foreigncreditors and to meet its foreign commitments in a orderly way,"du Plessis told a news conference.    Du Plessis said the new interim debt agreement was"substantially a continuation" of the arrangement ending in Juneand calls for South Africa to continue paying all interest onits total foreign debt of 23 billion dlrs.    The new debt standstill will extend from July 1, 1987, toJune 30, 1990, with a three pct down payment permitted on July15, 1987, "provided such debt has already reached maturity," duPlessis said.    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis told a new conferencethat 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debtagreed to the new arrangement worked out with South Africannegotiators in London. About 300 other creditor banks also areexpected to approve the agreement, he said.    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreementwas a "good deal" both for South Africa and the banks and addedthat the three-year length of the agreement was of "enormoussignificance" to South Africa.    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreementwas a "good deal" both for South Africa and the banks.    Besides the 13-billion-dlr frozen debt, South Africa alsoowes ten billion dlrs of debt that includes a significantamount of medium -term liabilities that will continue to berepaid on normal maturity dates.    The 13 pct to be repaid under the standstill amounts to1.42 billion dollars.    A total of five pct or 508 mln dlrs will be repaid in thesecond half of 1987, with 3.5 pct or 400 mln dlrs in calendar1988, three pct or 346 mln dlrs in calendar 1989 and 1.5 pct or166 mln dlrs in the first half of 1990.    Du Plessis said 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of thefrozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with SouthAfrican negotiators in London.    About 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approvethe agreement, he said.    De Kock, speaking at the same news conference, said thethree-year length of the agreement was of "enormous significance"to South Africa.    De Kock said South Africa had negotiated from a "position ofbasic economic financial strength."    "We were never overborrowed to begin with and we are nowunderborrowed by all international criteria that I've everheard of," he said.    Du Plessis said available foreign reserves of the ReserveBank, which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past twomonths, and a continued current account surplus "will besufficient" to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement.    Du Plessis said the banks were showing much more confidencein the South African economy and country as a whole.    He attributed this to "restoration of law and order whichhas greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also theintensity of unrest."    South Africa has been under a state of emergency since June1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over2,400 lives in the past three years.    Du Plessis said no political demands were made by the banksand South Africa was now rapidly returning to very goodrelations with its foreign creditors.    He said there were encouraging signs that some foreigninvestors were again "taking a more realistic view" of SouthAfrica.    Recent examples were the rise in the financial rand and thesharp increase in foreign exchange reserves.    Of the 13 billion dlr frozen debt, 3.5 billion dlrs wasowed by the public sector and 9.5 billion dlrs by privateindustry, du Plessis said.    The remaining 10 billion dlrs consisted of seven billiondlrs owed by government agencies and three billion dlrs by theprivate sector. Reuter&#3;
reut2-008.sgm, STANDARD CHARTERED BOOSTED BAD-DEBT PROVISIONS, Standard Chartered Plc &lt;STCH.L>, facedwith a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets andan ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted itsbad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.    Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results thatbad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific,stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.    Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively inthe specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Taxbreaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.    In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Totalpre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.    "The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singaporeand Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shippingindustry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad anddoubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, ontop of the normal level of provisioning," Barber said.    He said, "the decision was also taken to build up loan lossreeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges forgeneral provisions for commercial and cross border risks."    Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacificregion made "a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits."    He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesseswas "well maintained, although the reported result was affectedby cross border debt provisioning," while Californian subsidiaryUnion Bank "showed continued growth."    "Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned inexcellent performances and the revival in Europe continued," hesaid.    Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off atakeover bid by Lloyds Bank &lt;LLOY.L> last year, strengthenedits capital resources during that year to just over threebillion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.    Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primarycapital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said. Reuter&#3;

Coffee export revenue for 1986 was 2.33 billion dlrs,according to the bank.    Jorge Cardenas, manager of the National Coffee Growers'Federation, last week estimated the recent drop of 30 cents alb in coffee prices would mean a net loss revenue of 457 mlndlrs for Colombia.

reut2-008.sgm, KODAK &lt;EK> TO CUT POLYESTER FIBER OPERATIONS, Eastman Kodak Co said it willreduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiberoperations of its Eastman Chemicals division.    A company spokesman said the company will take "somewriteoff" in connection with the action in the first quarterand there will probably be a further "carryover" writeoff inthe second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs ofplants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connectedwith the staff cuts.    Kodak said the division will discontinue production ofpolyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at itsCarolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,mostly in Columbia.    The company said about 350 jobs will be affected inColumbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant inKingsport, Tenn.    Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achievedthrough an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement planfor employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical ProductsInc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten DefenseCorp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to becompleted by April 30.    Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performancehave led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POYproduction will be shut down as a result of its exit from thebusiness. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastmansince last year.    The company said annual capacity for production of Kodelpolyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from500 mln due to lesser demand.    It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phasein a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.    Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsportunits affected about 10,800.    The company spokesman later said the charges will beinsignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

reut2-008.sgm, ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET, The shareholders of IllinoisCooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of manyMidwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will voteWednesday on its possible dissolution.    The directors of the company called a special meeting andrecommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volumeand increasing costs.    Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pulloutof Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capitalstock, led to the call for dissolution.    The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearinghouses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regionaland local cooperatives that comprise its membership.    Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farmcooperative with major river terminal elevators, that foundedIllinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.    But Growmark became affiliated last year with ArcherDaniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain througha joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.    With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to tradefutures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, presidentof the co-op.    Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed acooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. Anotable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which becameaffiliated with Cargill, Inc.    Illinois Co-op's other members include such regionalcooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist,of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industriesin Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, andHarvest States in Minneapolis.    Some observors said the demise of Illinois CooperativeFutures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.    Instead of banding together, the individual cooperativesare forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of onecash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.    Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farmcooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a fewmajor commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.    Don Hanes, vice president for communications with theNational Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperativesexist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.    "The period we've gone through in the past five years hasbeen quite a crunch," he said. "There's been a lot ofconsolidation in the marketing co-ops."    One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to themajor commercials for export, rather than exporting itthemselves, losing potential profits.    But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and themulti-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by FarmersExport Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served "to makefolks gun-shy," Hanes said.    Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it isapproved, is a result of change in the futures industry ratherthan a change in U.S. agricultural economics.    A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit ofmoney. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way ofdoing business."    "We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside," he said."But there are lot of people out there to do business with.There are plenty of capable firms."    Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketingwith Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futuresthrough a Chicago-based cooperative.    "In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed toindividuals, there would be economic savings," he said butadded, "The times change and with changing times, comedifferent opinions of what businesses ought to be around."    Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm hadnothing to do with its profitability. "I would guarantee youthat this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthyorganization."    In the year ended February 28, 1986, the IllinoisCooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members'equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report forthe most recent year has not been filed.    Under the cooperative system, income from operations isreturned as "patronage refunds" to the members.    Income and refunds in the past five years have beendeclining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-opreported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28,1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.    "You're dealing with substantially lower volume," Mulligansaid. "Lower volume translates into higher costs."    According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmarkowns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the commonshares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.    Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capitalGrowmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine thefigure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volumeand, as a result, changes from year to year.    However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meetminimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmarkpulled out. Reuter&#3;

"It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria," said one arbitrageur,referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs pershare and ended when ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> found a white knightwilling to bid 36.50 dlrs.    For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemedlike an "appropriate price." Another said "it's too early toproject the outcome."    "The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlroffer is inadequate," the second arbitrageur said. But he addedit was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much morethan the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.    He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens andthere could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac isable to thwart Mark IV.    Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its boardstudies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said itwould make a recommendation by April 17.    A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved inseveral takeovers previously and has proven itself to be adetermined bidder. "They're not beginners," he said.    Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to findanother buyer. "It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,"he said. "There is only a small universe of people who wouldwant to own the company as it's presently structured."    Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, weldingequipment and other products.    "I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest forthose who can take the risk," said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst atMilwaukee Co.    He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV "fair value but onthe low side." "I don't think management was looking for abuyer in any way before this offer," he said.    Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and hasdeveloped a reputation for quality products that serve nichemarkets.

Wainoco said it had filed a registration statement with theSecurities and Exchange Commission for the offering of the twomln units consisting of two shares of common stock and onewarrrant per unit for a total of four mln shares of commonstock and two mln warrants.    Included in the two mln units to be offered are 280,000shares of common stock to be sold by &lt;Waverly Oil Co>, a selling shareholder of Wainoco, it said.    Proceeds of the offering will be used to reduce bank debt,the company said. It said its outstanding 10-3/4 pctsubordinated debentures may be used at face value to pay theexercise price of the warrants.    Wainoco said the offering will be underwritten by  E.F.Hutton and Co Inc, Kidder Peabody and Co Inc, and Smith Barneyharris Upham Inc.    Simultaneous with the offering, Wainoco said it intends toredeem its shareholder value rights attached to each commonshare at 10 cts per right. Wainoco said without redemption ofthe value rights, the company would not have sufficientauthorized and unissued shares of common stock to complete theunits offering.    Due to certain covenants under the company's 10-3/4 pctsubordinated debentures, the value rights redemption iscontingent upon the success of the units offering, it said.    Wainoco's said its shareholders purchase rights distributedto the shareholders in June 1986 are unaffected and remainvalid.    It said as a result of the liquidation of its Canadiansubsidiary into the parent company, it will be able to offsetall of its corporate overhead expenses and some of itsdebenture interests against Canadian income for tax purposes.    Wainoco said its pool of future Canadian tax deductions hasbeen increased by an amount which should generate savings thatwill exceed existing deferred income tax liability.    Existing U.S. tax loss carryforward benefits in the U.S.are not materially affected, the company said. It added thiswill considerably reduce future income taxes in Canada and addto Wainoco's net income and cash flow for a number of years.

reut2-008.sgm, COCOA BUFFER STOCK ACCORD CLOSER, DELEGATES SAY, The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, withmany delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.    "Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be inplace by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operationMonday," a consumer delegate said. "The atmosphere is excellent."    Other delegates said the buffer stock might not beoperational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1,if the rules are agreed by Friday.    A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buyand sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working groupthis afternoon -- a big step toward a "very interesting stage ofnegotiations," delegates said.    The package, based on negotiating principles informallyagreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit duringfortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director KobenaErbynn and a small group of other delegates.    Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers arescheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointlytomorrow.    Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buycocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offersystem. He would alert the market via news agencies as to whenhe wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnagedesired, delegates said.    The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, ratherthan choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preferenceto ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentialswould be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, todetermine the relative competitiveness of offers of variouscocoas from different origins, they said.    The differentials could be reviewed at the request of amember country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager,the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majorityvote of the ICCO council.    Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries wouldnot be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, theysaid.    The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa perday and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby,intermediate and forward positions, they added.    One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is"transparency," meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager'smarket activities will be public and he will have as littlediscretion as possible, delegates said.    After the tin market collapse in 1985, when theInternational Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoadelegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa marketmechanism, they said.     Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected tobegin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of theapproaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due toadjourn, delegates said.    The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January whenthe new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. Theexisting buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen inplace with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchableuntil rules are agreed.     Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not thelast chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules,producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizingmechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices,delegates said.

reut2-008.sgm, MEXICO SEES COMPROMISE ON IADB REFORMS, There is a good chance that the UnitedStates and Latin America will agree reforms in theInter-American Development Bank (IADB) as a result of talksyesterday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, MexicanFinance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said.    "This is a complex issue, but I am very optimistic on anagreement, he told reporters during the IADB's annual meetinghere.    The U.S., which holds a 34.5 pct stake in the Bank, hasproposed lowering the veto power to 35 pct, a move stronglyopposed by Latin countries which together hold 54.2 pct.    Petricioli said he saw the basis for a compromise when theissue comes up again during the International Monetary Fund andWorld Bank interim meetings next month in Washington.    He said Baker had indicated receptivity to Latin America'sposition during talks yesterday with the so-called "A"countries - Brazil, Argentina and Mexico - who stand to suffera net deficit of IADB funding unless the Bank votes asubstantial capital increase.    Proposals are on the table for a seventh replenishment offunds totalling 20 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90, plus2.9 billion carried over from the sixth replenishment.    But Washington has previously said it would not agree to anine billion dlr increase in its subscription unless reformswere agreed, a position described today by Nicaragua's CentralBank governor Joaquin Cuadra Chamorro as undemocratic.    Petricioli nevertheless said Baker showed "flexibility inbeing prepared to accommodate different proposals" and promisedto look into alternatives.    He said an alternative now being looked at was for newprocedures for delaying IADB loan approval, to satisfy U.S.concern that lending is currently too lax, rather than a changein the basic voting structure.    There would accordingly be a two-step procedure whereby itwould need just a 35 pct vote to delay loan approval for ayear, after which a second review would require a 40 pctblocking vote.    "Any change in the basic voting structure would require achange in the IADB's charter, and in turn a lengthy process ofprior approval by the Congresses of each country," Petriciolisaid. In common with Venezuela, he expressed reservations onthe conditions that might be placed as a result of Washington'sproposals for increased IADB sectoral lending, but welcomed abigger role for the Bank in U.S. debt strategy.

reut2-008.sgm, PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986, The state oil company Petroeleos deVenezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income fromoil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal byalmost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and MinesArturo Hernandez Grisanti said.    Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annualassembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales haddropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from lastyear's 13.3 billion.    Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34pct which Hernandez said "had a very serious impact onVenezuela."    PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, ofwhich 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refinedproducts.    The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpdand the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was notenough to cover the losses from a drop in the average pricefrom 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.    The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higherthan the figure originally announced by the Central Bank.Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accountingsystem which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refiningand marketing operations.    Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However,Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keepgasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.    Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrelsin reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance ofVenezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country'sproduction capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, ofwhich 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.     Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in theworld, Hernandez said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, IMPERIAL OIL &lt;IMO.A> TO FOCUS ON HIGHER PROFIT, Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by ExxonCorp &lt;XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strengthand improving near-term earnings performance through operatingexpense reductions and selective capital spending, the companysaid in the annual report.    Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs oncapital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985.    Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fellto 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27dlrs share in the prior year.    Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results fromthe desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities shouldthe investment climate improve and the belief that low orvolatile crude oil prices could continue during the nextseveral years.    The company also said actions initiated during 1986 torestructure and improve efficiency should continue to showbenefits in 1987.    During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative andmarketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number ofworkers by 16 pct to 12,500.    Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual reportthat it is too early to determine whether the recent upwardmovement in international oil prices will be sustained.    "It is still a time for prudence and caution, and thecompany's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentalsof market supply and demand," he said.    Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum productsdivision are more promising than before, but are stilluncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mlndlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985.    Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on itspetroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has inthe United States.    The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynessaid. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good aslong as economic growth continues, but future large grainsurpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressureon prices.    Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986,compared to three mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter&#3;

The transaction is expected to be completed by September30.    CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year fromthe transaction. But the effect of the deal on 1987 earningscan be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts arecompleted, it said.    The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC's earningsshould be positive, it added, as it will allow capitalexpenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate anddivisional overheads as well as operating expenses in theEuropean business.    The sale is an important part of a restructuring announcedin November, CPC said.    Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurredin the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialtybaking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was part of the restructuring.    As of December 31, CPC had bought about 15 mln of itscommon shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for atotal cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annualreport.    In December, CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for atotal of about 170 mln dlrs.    CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European cornwet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt,including that incurred under the share buyback.    In total, CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of commonstock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November itauthorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.    The buyback and the restructuring were triggered inNovember, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman,chairman of Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV>, acquired about 7.6 pct ofCPC's then outstanding stock.

reut2-008.sgm, NEW S.AFRICA ACCORD WITH BANKS BROUGHT COMPROMISE, A new agreement covering the repaymentof part of South Africa's foreign debt represents a compromisebetween that country and its commercial bank creditorsfollowing several weeks of intense and difficult negotiations,senior banking sources said.    In Pretoria, Reserve Bank Governor Gerhard De Kock termedthe agreement a "good deal" for both South Africa and the banks.    But as one senior banker noted, "It is probably the best wecould hope for. We (the banks) wanted more money and they (theSouth Africans) didn't want to pay."    The new agreement will extend for three years thestandstill arrangement that has been in place since August 1985and which was due to expire on June 30.    Depending on the maturity of the various debts, banks willreceive on July 15 repayments representing three pct of thearrears and the overdue debt covered by the standstill.    It also will require the repayment over the life of thestandstill of another 10 pct of the overdue debt spread oversix month invervals and depending on the maturity of thevarious debts for a total of slightly more than 1.4 billiondlrs.    Last year South Africa repaid about 500 mln dlrs out of the14 billion dlrs covered by the standstill. At the time, bankershad argued - unsuccessfully - for a larger repayment given thecountry's trade surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs.    Bankers had hoped that this time they could secure an evenlarger repayment of around one billion dlrs. Although there hadbeen speculation that the standstill would be extended forthree years, many did not believe that a long term pact wouldbe acceptable to U.S. banks. Those banks have taken a hard linein the negotiations because of America's strong anti-apartheidpolicies.    The agreement reached today differs very little from theone reached a little over a year ago. However, it does includeone moderation of an option contained in that pact whichintroduces yet another "catchphrase" into the jargon forreschedulings.    The new agreement contains an "exit vehicle" under whichbanks can convert their debt into 10 year loans. Under theprevious agreement banks were only given options for three yearloans.    While the option may be unpalatable to the U.S. banks, itcould offer others a potential repayment of slightly more thanhalf their investment over the next seven years.    To convert the debts, a bank would have to find a borrowerlooking for a loan with a 10-year maturity and then negotiateindividually the interest rates to be charged.    The loans would not represent any new money and as the loanwould be the obligation of the new borrower there would be arepayment stream that could give the bank as much as 52 pct offace value by year seven, one banker said.    Bankers suggested that depending on a banks' political andeconomic forecasts for South Africa, if it decided to take theoption it may not have much difficulty finding such borrowers.They noted that South Africa's Public Investment Commission isan active borrower in this area of the market.    Today's agreement was reached between South Africa's chiefdebt negotiator Chris Stals, who chairs its StandstillCoordinating Commmittee and representatives of the 12 banks onthe commercial bank technical committee.    The bankers said that telexes will be sent today to thecountry's other 330 bank creditors and that documentationcovering the proposal will be mailed out shortly.    Because of the banks' sensitivity to South Africa'sapartheid regime, the previous negotiations were conducted withFritz Leutwiler, the former head of the Swiss National Bank,acting as mediator.    Leutwiler was not involved with these talks and has notinvolved himself in the negotiations since last year, thebankers said.    Last time, the banks sent their responses on the proposalto Leutwiler who in turn notified the South Africans. This timethe procedure will be less structured and will be up to theindividual banks as to how they wish to handle it.    Although talks had been held in recent weeks between theSouth Africans and the banks, the completion of the agreementon the repayments took many in the financial community bysurprise.    A review of South Africa's economy by the technicalcommittee's economic sub-committee was to be held in Februarywhile the talks for the rescheduling were due to start sometime this month or next month.    However, the bankers said that because of all the publicitywhich surrounds South African debt negotiations, the meetingswere kept secret. Reuter&#3;

reut2-008.sgm, U.S. HOUSE PANEL EASES SOVIET EXPORT CONTROLS, The U.S. House Foreign AffairsCommittee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are nowkept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer athreat to U.S. national security.    The Democratic-controlled committee said theadministration's export control policies, which restrictshipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year'srecord 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.    The committee said the legislation will cut government redtape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete withforeign producers since many of the goods are readily availablefrom other countries.    Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International EconomicPolicy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had costthe U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.    "This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack thetrade deficit in a positive way by exporting more," theWashington Democrat said.    The legislation would order the Commerce Department to liftcontrols on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list overthe next three years unless other countries agree to comparablecontrols.    Most of these are of the least sophisticated type oftechnology such as medical instruments.    It would also give the Commerce Department primaryauthority to decide which exports will be permitted and limitthe Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewingrequests to export highly-sensitive technology.

reut2-008.sgm, SOUTH AFRICA, CREDITOR BANKS AGREE ON DEBT PLAN, South Africa will repay 13 pct of itsfrozen 13 billion dollar debt to foreign creditors over thenext three years under an agreement reached today in London,Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said.    He said South Africa already had repaid five pct of thedebt under the standstill agreement expiring on June 30, 1987.    "These arrangements confirm South Africa's continuedwillingness to maintain good relations with its foreigncreditors and to meet its foreign commitments in a orderly way,"du Plessis told a news conference.    Du Plessis said the new interim debt agreement was"substantially a continuation" of the arrangement ending in Juneand calls for South Africa to continue paying all interest onits total foreign debt of over 23 billion dlrs.    Du Plessis said 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of thefrozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with SouthAfrican negotiators in London. About 300 other creditor banksalso are expected to approve the agreement, he said.    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreementwas a "good deal" both for South Africa and the banks.    Speaking at the same news conference, de Kock said thethree-year length of the agreement was of "enormous significance"to South Africa.    He said South Africa had negotiated from a "position ofbasic economic financial strength."    "We were never overborrowed to begin with and we are nowunderborrowed by all international criteria that I've everheard of," de Kock said.    Du Plessis said available foreign reserves of the ReserveBank, which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past twomonths, and a continued current account surplus "will besufficient" to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement.    Du Plessis said the banks were showing much more confidence inthe South African economy and country as a whole.    He attributed this to "restoration of law and order whichhas greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also theintensity of unrest."    South Africa has been under a state of emergency since June1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over2,400 lives in the past three years.    Du Plessis said no political demands were made by the banksand South Africa was now rapidly returning to very goodrelations with its foreign creditors.    He said there were encouraging signs that some foreigninvestors were again "taking a more realistic view" of SouthAfrica. Recent examples were the rise in the financial rand andthe sharp increase in foreign exchange reserves, he said.    Of the 13 billion dlrs frozen debt 3.5 billion was owed bypublic sector and 9.5 billion by private industry, du Plessissaid. The remaining 10 billion consists of seven billion owedby government agencies and three billion by the private sector. Reuter&#3;
