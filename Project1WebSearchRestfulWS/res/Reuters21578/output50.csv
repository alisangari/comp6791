reut2-007.sgm, FAIRFAX SAYS HIGHER TAX HITS FIRST HALF EARNINGS, Media group John Fairfax Ltd &lt;FFXA.S>said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected theimpact of changes in the Australian tax system.    Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mlna year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30mln from 44.29 mln.    Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase incompany tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax onfringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, thecompany said in a statement.    Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenuegrowth in the television industry as another reason for theflat first half earnings.    It said it considered the result satisfactory in view ofthese factors.    Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney MorningHerald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, asdid the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremelysatisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.    But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0pct rise in revenue, it said.    Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to netearnings because group borrowings were reduced following thereceipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from &lt;AustralianAssociated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's "B"shares in Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L>.    This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.    Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for thefull year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlracquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbournewill hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens inSydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

The United States has accused Japan of reneging on thesemiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-priceJapanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened totake retaliatory action after April 1.    The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop sellingcut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports ofAmerican chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.    MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has beenpressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that willboost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.    Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers toreduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeksof the first quarter.    If that reduced production level were maintained through tothe end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pctbelow that of the first three months of the year.    MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said theministry has not yet decided on the extent of the secondquarter cutback.    One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground inAsia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets thereare picking up.    MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanesesemiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attemptsto ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact. REUTER&#3;

The unadjusted rise was 1.31 billion stg, compared with an813 mln stg increase in January.    The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of1.6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average ofabout 1.0 billion stg.    Of the increase, 297 mln stg was accounted for by personallending, which the Banking Information Service said was takenup entirely by lending for home purchases.    Lending for consumption fell around 17 mln stg while about182 mln stg of credit card debt was repaid during the month.    Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg,and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg.    The Banking Information Service said February fell withinthe governmemnt tax season, so much of the lending was probablythe result of industry's need to pay its tax bills.    Deposits by the private sector rose an unadjusted 1.1billion stg in February and by a seasonally-adjusted 1.75billion stg.

Foreign governments and multilateral organisations holdone-third of Ecuador's 8.16 billion dlrs total foreign debt, hesaid in a news conference at the presidential palace.    But he added that the suspension of payments to privateforeign banks, who hold the rest of the foreign debt, would beprolonged though the government hoped to negotiate an agreementwith these creditors.    President Leon Febres Cordero says the earthquake cost thecountry one billion dlrs in losses and left 1,000 people deador missing.    Swett, who was Finance Minister of Ecuador between August1984 to June 1986, added: "With the private foreign banks therehas been a ceasing of payments by Ecuador.    "We are bringing forward the respective negotiations whoseconclusion we hope finalises in the next few weeks."    Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said last week thatquake-hit Ecuador sought through negotiations to postpone allpayments due to the private foreign banks in 1987 until nextyear.    Although Swett gave no gave details on the latest plan fornegotiations with private foreign banks, he calculated thesuspension of payment to these creditors would save thegovernment 54.45 billion sucres.    This amount is equal to 363 mln dlrs at the free rate of150 sucres to the dollar -- the rate Swett said reportersshould use in calculating the dollar equivalent.    The Ecuadorean central bank, which is the institutionremitting debt payments abroad, uses the official rate of 95sucres to the dollar for its accounting purposes. At theofficial rate, the 54.45 billion sucres' sum equals 573 mlndlrs.    Ecuador, squeezed by a slide last year in prices for crude,its main export, suspended payments to private foreign banks inJanuary.    Swett said the government would also seek to refinance the1.429 billion dlr section of the debt owed to the Paris Clubgroup of foreign governments, though it would continue toservice the debt with them. He gave no more details.    The government adopted a tough austerity program lastFriday intended to grapple with the tremor's economic costs.But the country's labour unions have called a general strikefor Wednesday to press for a suspension of the program.    The 500,000-strong Unitary Workers' Front (FUT) and the100,000-member General Union of Workers (UGT) called the striketo cancel the measures, which include a rise in petrol pricesof up to 80 per cent and budget cuts of as much as 10 per cent.    The leftist-led FUT said it was also backing a call by theMaoist Popular Movement for Democracy (MPD) party, to haveCongress impeach and oust Febres Cordero, a conservative, forhaving adopted the austerity measures.

Their comments followed remarks by prime minister JacquesChirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministerswere agreed on the desirability of "relaunching" the economy.    This sparked speculation the government was preparing for areflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruledout any such move.    The sources today said the government's policy remained oneof "recovery," or sound finances and greater efficiency.    They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion francrevenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisationprogram will go to providing public companies with freshcapital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go towardpaying off national debt.    Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30billion would be distributed between repayment of nationalinternal debt and public companies in similar proportions, theyadded.    The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation whenthe country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct thisyear from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice asfast as gross domestic product.    Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct thisyear from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line withearlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.

"The difference between us (Hong Kong and the U.K.) isreally not that great," he said.    Fell said the majority of banks are comfortable with therequired capital ratio, though some are under-capitalised.    Some banks, mostly Japanese, want a lower capital ratiobecause of the special nature of their business, mainlyoffshore banking operations. These institutions have proposedthe creation of a limited service bank category.    Financial institutions in Hong Kong are now classified intothree types -- banks, registered and licensed deposit-takingcompanies.    Fell said the Commission is reviewing the three-tierstructure in light of the possible changes in capital ratio andthe growing trend towards securitisation of debt.    Fell said the Commission is also studying a set ofguidelines on loan loss provisions with the help of the Societyof Accountants.    Other planned guidelines relate to securitisation of debtand business that banks and deposit taking companies canconduct. REUTER&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - SPENDING, M-1, Brisk increases in personal income andconsumption are to appear in February data released today, butthe bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be nomajor price reaction unless the rises are much larger thanexpected, economists said.    Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,compared with no change in January, while consumptionexpenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.    M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also bereleased. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.        Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Incexpects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wageand salary disbursements in February.    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, theaverage workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose byfour cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durablegoods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of atleast 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bondmarket much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slippingjust 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrowrange, desperately seeking direction.    "Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bondmarket," quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities CoInternational Inc.    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said thesteadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite somesigns of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectationsthat inflation will remain subdued.    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.    "It took the bond market a long while to see that inflationwas not returning to double digits, and now that it has learnedthat lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to fivepct inflation is a real possibility ahead," Boltz said in areport.    After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds wereindicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct. Reuter&#3;
reut2-007.sgm, U.S. DELEGATION HOPES FOR VEG OILS TAX DEFEAT, American soybean producers and processorsare hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats willnot be imposed, but say the U.S. Is prepared to retaliate if itis introduced.    Wayne Bennett, the American Soybean Association's firstvice president, told a news conference the U.S. Administrationwould not hesitate to retaliate, but both producers andprocessors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation.    U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letterto EC officials that U.S. Retaliatory measures would cover morethan agricultural products if the tax was imposed, Bennettsaid.    The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association (NSPA)delegations will meet top West German government officialstoday and tomorrow to lobby for support.    Bennett said West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands,Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax, but Italy and Belgium seemto have taken a hardline view on the issue.    "Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to theiradvantage economically, but that is not correct because wewould hit back," NSPA chairman Jack Reed said.    This step would be very expensive for all and no one wouldemerge as a winner if the tax were introduced, he said.    Reed pointed out the U.S. Administration and the soybeanindustry view the EC proposal as violating the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.    The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindingsagreed between the EC and U.S. In 1962, he said.    Under the zero duty bindings pact U.S. Soybeans andproducts can be exported to the Community duty-free. REUTER&#3;
reut2-007.sgm, H.K. BANKING SECTOR STABLE, OFFICIAL SAYS, The banking sector has regained itsstability after a protracted period of difficulty, bankingcommissioner Robert Fell said.    "The banking climate has dramatically changed from a yearago," he said at a news conference to present his annual reporton the banking sector for 1986.    "We've got confidence back. We've got profitability back." hesaid.    A three-year shake out in the local banking sector forcedthe government to take over three banks and arrange for theacquisition of four others by the private sector.    Fell said that in many cases the bank problems stemmed frommanagement fraud which he linked partly to dramatic swings inthe stock and property markets in the early 1980s.    "We've got it out of the system now," he said. "Fraud is nolonger a systemic problem."    But he acknowledged there may still be problems.    "Deliberate fraud is difficult to detect especially wherecollusion and senior management are involved," he said."Prudential supervision cannot give complete protection. The(new banking) ordinance is designed to give a "measure" ofprotection."    Fell said a number of banks want to set up operations inHong Kong, adding the government approved three bankinglicences this week. He did not give details.    At the end of 1986, there were 151 licenced banks, 25 ofwhich were locally incorporated, compared with 143 a year ago.Another 134 foreign banks had representative offices comparedwith 131 a year ago.    There were 34 licensed deposit-taking companies (DTCs) and254 registered DTCs at the end of 1986, compared with 35 and278 respectively a year ago, he said.    Foreign banks seeking banking licences in Hong Kong musthave assets of 14 billion U.S. Dlrs. But Financial SecretaryPiers Jacobs said yesterday the asset criteria are flexible.    A high asset threshold has worked in the favour of banksincorporated in countries with relatively large economies, henoted.

reut2-007.sgm, S.AFRICA'S FINANCIAL RAND SEEN HEADED HIGHER, The financial rand, widely viewedas a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in SouthAfrica, appears headed above 30 U.S. Cents, dealers and bankeconomists said.    The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past threemonths to its current rate of 29.50 cents, due partly to signsof a possible power shift with the appearance of a number ofindependent candidates in the whites-only election on May 6,they added.    It has risen about two cents this week alone.    "Another factor is that banks in London, where the mainmarket is based, are going long in the currency because of ageneral feeling that it will rise in the future," one economistsaid.    Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier thatwas expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidationphase from recent gains.    After reaching 30 cents, "There is a chance of appreciationto 32 cents in the next several weeks," one dealer said.    There was a widespread feeling that both the commercialrand, holding stable at 48 cents, and the financial rand werestaying firm, banking sources said.    A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to beidentified said: "The rise of the independents appears to beindicative of a potential shift of power in the National Partyand has created a favourable sentiment overseas."    One dealer said growing business and investor interest fromWest Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rand'srise.    Economists said foreigners also were being attracted bySouth Africa's long-term government bonds and "semi-gilts" orsecurities in partly government-owned firms, many with yieldsas high as 30 pct. They could be purchased with financial randswith interest paid in commercial rands.    "This has had a definite influence on the financial form ofthe rand," a dealer said, adding that at present demand isslightly in excess of supply.    The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 tohelp end capital flight from South Africa during a period ofsevere political unrest in the country. REUTER&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, GERMAN INVESTORS SLOW TO ACCEPT BOND INNOVATIONS, The liberalization of West Germancapital markets in May 1985 led to a flood of financialinnovations but the lack of a secondary market for these hasdiminished their acceptance, Deutsche Girozentrale - DeutscheKommunalbank management board member Wiegand Hennicke said.    While innovations may be intellectualy stimulating, theylack transparency, he told an investors' forum in West Berlin.    "Properly functioning markets require standardized products.This (condition) has not been met by some of the innovations,"Hennicke said.    The volume of zero coupon bonds and floating rate notes,the most widely used financial innovations in Germany, standsat four billion and 16 billion marks, respectively, a tinyproportion of the 1,000 billion marks of bonds in circulation.    Even for zero-coupon bonds and floating rate notes, asecondary market had not developed, Hennicke said. Oneimportant reason for this was the bourse turnover tax, whichwas reducing the rate of return to the investors.    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said thisweek he believed the tax could still be removed, even if itsabolition was not decided during recent coalition discussions.    Karl-Herbert Schneider-Gaedicke, deputy management boardchairman of DG Bank Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, said Germandomestic and institutional investors had also shownreservations about investing in participation shares.    One of the reasons was the widely varying terms andconditions of participation shares in West Germany. "Theinvestor has to scrutinize (participation shares) carefully,before making an investment decision," Schneider-Gaedicke said.    He added the attractiveness of participation shares couldbe increased by limiting the combination possibilities of termsand conditions and increasing safeguards for investors.    He also urged publicizing the comparative advantage ofparticipation shares over ordinary shares for foreigners.    Foreigners do not receive the corporation tax bonus grantedto domestic investors for share dividends.    Karl Thomas, head of the Bundesbank's credit department,said the domestic investor had missed earnings opportunitiesover the last four years by failing to invest in German bonds.    Domestic investors did not believe interest rates woulddecline and stay at low levels for such a long time, becauseexpectations were determined by sharp interest ratefluctuations at the start of the decade.    The Bundesbank has a natural interest in seeing domesticsavings channelled into bonds and shares, Thomas said.    A shift of savings into long-term assets would dampenmonetary expansion and foster a stable rise of the moneysupply, he said. REUTER&#3;

President Robert Staubli told a news conference it had notyet been decided whether the planes would have General ElectricCo &lt;GE.N>, Pratt and Whitney &lt;UTX> or Rolls Royce engines.    The airline said it chose the U.S. Plane rather than therival A-340 of the European Airbus consortium because it metbetter the Swissair requirements and would be able to enterservice in 1990 giving a smooth transition from the DC-10s itreplaces.    Staubli said Swissair planned to have replaced its wholefleet of 11 DC10s by 1992 at the latest, entailing the order offive more long-haul planes in addition to the six announcedtoday. He said it would decide on the basis of the developmentof traffic whether these five would be MD-11s or Boeing 747s.    However, Staubli ruled out the possibility that Swissairmight eventually choose A-340s. "We cannot afford to operatethree different types of aircraft," he said.    Swissair also had no short term plans to exercise itsoption to buy Airbus A-310s, of which it already operates nine,officials said. But it would still hold the options open.    Staubli declined to say how much it paid for each of theMD-11s. The total 1.2 billion franc figure was not only for theplanes but also for spare parts and other related expenditure.    Company officials said that Swissair intended to coveraround 75 pct of the costs of its entire DC-10 replacementprogramme with internally generated funds. It hopes to raisethe remaining 25 pct on the Swiss and other capital marketsthrough issuing straight or equity related bonds and/or througha capital increase.

A statement issued by the Treasury said "the BP announcementtherefore makes no difference to our estimate of privatisationproceeds in 1987/88, or to subsequent years, which remains 5.0billion stg a year."    "It makes no difference to the PSBR (Public Sector BorrowingRequirement) which the Chancellor set in the budget," it said.    "It has nothing to do with the future scope for tax cuts."

The Treasury statement said that the sell-off "is simply apart of the government's continuing privatisation programme,the overall size of which was announced in the Autumn(economic) Statement" (last November).    It said the BP proceeds "will be received in installments,of which the first will be in 1987/88."

reut2-007.sgm, OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED, The results of a controversial studyof farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has thehighest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairyfarmers benefit more than any other commodity producers fromsubsidies.    Results of the study, which has not been released by OECDbecause of objections from some countries, were provided toReuters by officials of several countries on condition they notbe identified.    The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies forthe years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producersubsidy equivalent, PSE.    The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or theamount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pctand the United States 48.2 pct.    For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 andthe U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.    In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pctcompared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the ECand 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.    For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in theEC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrialcountries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in mostcases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC andJapan, the sources said.    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developingcountry producers of commodities, were not included in the OECDwork.    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries torelease the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECDministerial meeting in Paris during May.    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global tradetalks now underway in Geneva.    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visitto Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a startingpoint for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiatedown domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause ofthe present crisis in world agriculture.    However, the OECD study results are controversial becausethey highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officialsfamiliar with the study said.    The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Servicerecently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt toverify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.    In some cases the results were substantially different thanthe OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. andelsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD baseperiod of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.    For example, the USDA study found the United Statessubsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, toldreporters last week that the United States subsidizes itsfarmers more than the EC.    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probablyhigher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.    Officials of several countries have been asked tocontribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of thecurrent world farm situation.    The updated calculations, which may take several months tocomplete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictiveimport quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farmbill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments tograin farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officialsadded. Reuter&#3;

President Robert Staubli told a news conference that thefirst two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit wouldat least equal last year's figure, but said much depended onoutside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.    The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss onSwissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of27 mln francs the previous year, he said.    The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francsin 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended onthe speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.    Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.    Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mlnfrancs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45mln francs supplementary depreciation.    Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions madethis time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange ratefluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.    While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop inthe dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuelprices, there was no such offset for the strength of the francagainst other European currencies.    "Income and profit generated by services to these countriesshrank by a very substantial margin," he said. "Exchange ratetrends therefore hit us much more severely than most otherairlines." Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, COCOA DELEGATES OPTIMISTIC ON BUFFER STOCK RULES, Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoabuffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization,ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said.    Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after theopening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoamarket support mechanism were improving.    "The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stockrules by the end of next week," Ghanaian delegate and producerspokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists.    Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of thenegotiations "optimistic and realistic."    The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules whena new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January,with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussionson the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250mln dlrs.    The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority atthis semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide inworld cocoa prices.    Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principlesas a basis for negotiations.    The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. Aworking group which has been meeting since Monday will tacklethe buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCOexecutive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out versionof a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegatessaid.    Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indicationof prospects for an accord after details of the rules areelaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meetseparately later today to examine the scheme.    The draft proposal included three principles: a limit tonon- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer systemfor buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to bepaid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegatessaid.    During the morning council session, the Ivory Coastdelegation gave "an open minded statement" that it is willing towork out a buffer stock rules solution which could come intoeffect as soon as possible, Baron said.    Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman ofthe ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Mondayto attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henryof Grenada chaired the meeting in his place.    Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the councilsession because of a conflicting International SugarOrganization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon,delegates said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD, A new market has emerged in warrants tobuy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the playof commodity options into the field of securities.    Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American bankshave launched a total of four issues of warrants with varyingconditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and therecovery of the gold price last year.    And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston eachissued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have asimilar character, though they are aimed at a less professionalmarket.    The market is still small. Taken together, the fourAmerican-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swissfrancs.    But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors andpredicted a lively future.    Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AGsaid: "The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have along-term investment in gold with limited risk."    Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants onFebruary 27, following it up with a second issue less than aweek later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.    The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurichorganized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of BanqueIndosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty(Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co ofNew York.    The four issues now offer investors striking prices forgold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, thesame price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level onthe first one for Citibank.    The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturitiesfrom 18 months to four years and three months, in all caseslonger than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.    The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back tothe February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when ajump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.    "Many people are worried about inflation again," said MatsJoensson of Goldman Sachs. "Money supply in Germany and theUnited States has grown very strongly in the last year andpeople want to take a ride on gold."    The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, haslanguished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past fewweeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a morehighly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.    Barrett said it was natural that the market developed inSwitzerland. "People here understand gold, and they understandwarrants," he said.    Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series ofequity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company sharesover the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launchedcovered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to giveforeign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closedto all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.    But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried upwhen Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.    The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simplepremiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to providescientific comparisons between titles in the options market.    Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue wascompetitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, forfive ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, makinga premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.    Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue'slong, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicitvolatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,which he claimed was lower than the other issues.    But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp usedpointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue andemphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.    And each bank, using its own model, put the implicitvolatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.    Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warmwelcome from investors.    Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrantsapiece. "The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these becausethe premiums are too high," he said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, JEFFERIES &lt;JEFG> CHAIRMAN PLEADING GUILTY, QUITS, Jefferies Group Inc said founderand chairman Boyd L.

The company said neither Boyd Jefferies nor the companyever engaged in insider trading and neither he nor the companyever sought or communicated insider information or violated nytrust of confidence placed in them by customers.  It said nogovernmental authority has ever alleged any such activity onBoyd Jefferies' part or the part of the company.    The company said Boyd Jefferies has consented to anadministrative order barring him from the securities businessfor at least five years and he has agreed to place his 13 pctholding in Jefferies Group stock in a voting trust during thatperiod.    The company said, without admitting any allegations made bythe Securities and Exchange Commission, Boyd Jefferies,Jefferies Group and primary brokerage subsidiary Jefferies andCo also consented to an injunction barring any futuresecurities laws violations.    It said Jefferies and Co has agreed further to undertakereviews to assure that its internal recordkeeping and othercontrol systems are in compliance with federal laws.    The company said president and chief operating officerFrank E. Baxter will assume the added duties of chief executiveofficer.  Boyd Jefferies had been chief executive.    The company said the criminal charges against Boy Jefferiesresulted from a transaction in which, on behalf of Jefferiesand Co, he agreed to purchase stocks from entities controlledby Ivan F. Boesky and later resell the stock to the Boeskyfirms.    It said "Within days of the purchase, the market value ofone of the stocks fell sharply and, pursuant to theiragreement, a Boesky entity paid Jefferies and Co three mln dlrsto offset the loss.    The company said Boyd Jefferies will admit that followingthe loss he ordered that Boesky receive a bill for three mlndlrs for investment advisory and corporate finance services,although Jefferies and Co treated the three mln dlrs as anoffset to the losses it experienced.    It said by rendering the involice, Boyd Jefferiesapparently enabled one of the Boesky entities to make a falseentry in its books, resulting in the charge, to which BoydJefferies will plead guilty, of aiding and abetting one of theBoesky firms in making false entries on its books.    The company said Boyd Jefferies will also plead guilty to amargin violation resulting from a transaction in which hecaused Jefferies and Co to buy shares at the request of acustomer in the company's trading account.    It was expected that the customer would be responsible forany loss on the shares and would also receive any profit, andbecause the customer had not put up any funds for the purchase,Boyd Jefferies had in effect caused Jefferies and Co to financethe full purchase price for the shares in violation of marginrequirements, the company said.    The company quoted Boyd Jefferies as saying, "I fullyaccept sole responsibility for these transactions.  I think itis appropriate that I suffer the consequences for my actionsrather than the company."    Jefferies Group said it expects no impact on its operationsor client base from Boyd Jefferies' departure. Reuter&#3;

The White House has said it would consider the optionalthough it was generally opposed to any revisions in the newtax code.    Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and GasAssociation that the higher depletion allowance on new oil andenhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs ayear.    The option was one of many contained in a report on oil andthe national security the Energy Department sent to the WhiteHouse on Tuesday.    Herrington said of the increased depletion allowanceoption: "that is one that could significantly increaseproduction at a very low cost to the American taxpayer."

The increase followed a revised 0.2 pct rise in personalincome during January. Earlier, the department estimatedJanuary personal income was unchanged.    The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increasesince a 1.2 pct rise in April 1986, the department said. Itattributed last month's rise to several factors, includingsubsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises.    The department said personal consumption expenditures wereup during February by 1.7 pct or 49.1 billion dlrs to 2,855.9billion dlrs after falling by 58.4 billion dlrs or two pct inJanuary.    Purchases of durable goods were up 24.8 billion dlrs lastmonth after decreasing by 69.7 billion dlrs in January withsales of motor vehicles accounting for most of the Februaryincrease and the January decline, the department said.    Purchases of nondurables rose 10.7 billion dlrs in Februaryafter a 300 mln dlr increase in January.    The Commerce Department said wage and salary incomes wereup 15.6 billion dlrs in February after an 8.6 billion dlr risein January.    Manufacturing payrolls increased by 2.4 billion dlrs lastmonth after rising 1.9 billion dlrs in February with the gainswidespread through durable and nondurable industries, thedepartment said.    Farmers' incomes increased by 12.2 billion dlrs in Februaryafter declining by 8.7 billion dlrs in January. Both lastmonth's increase and January's fall in farm incomes was becauseof government subsidy payments, the department said.    Personal tax and nontax payments fell 5.5 billion dlrs inFebruary following a 19.5 billion dlrs January drop. The declines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.    Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from amonth earlier but that was offset by declines in federalnonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes.    Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up1.2 pct or 37.8 billion dlrs to 3,063.4 billion dlrs afterrising 25.8 billion dlrs in January.

He told a news conference that business during the year hadweakened somewhat but was still generally positive.    Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period.However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximatelyunchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks whencurrent orders from major projects are booked.    Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end-February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billionfor the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pctincrease in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks.    Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at8.64 billion marks.    Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pctyield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profitstotalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against theprevious year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks.    Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks.

reut2-007.sgm, SOVIET TIMECHARTERING BOOSTS GRAIN FREIGHT RATES, Current interest by Soviet charterers intaking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. Tocarry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recentsurge in values on the Baltic International Freight FuturesExchange (BIFFEX), dealers said.    Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today forthe first time in the spot position since the market opened inMay 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with valuessome 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which iscalculated on spot physical rates.    No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings butthey have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which wouldnormally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said.    "It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effecton its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported," one said.    Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route havesubsequently been the main beneficiary of current charteringconditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left forthe remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risensteadily for vessels loading next month.    Dealers said there is even talk that owners are consideringtaking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand.    Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chineseoperators may be in the market for similar timecharter businesslater in the year, they said.    They anticipate this would appear around June and it hasprompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite itnormally being a slack time in the shipping year.    Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Ratesturned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which hadsupported the market at the start of the year, faltered butthen recovered on the reported Soviet interest. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, TURKISH DEBT REACHED 31.4 BILLION DLRS AT END-1986, Turkey's external debt rose to theequivalent of 31.4 billion dlrs at end-1986 from 25.4 billion ayear earlier, Treasury Under-secretary Yavuz Canevi said.    Canevi, who gave the figure at a briefing on the Turkisheconomy arranged for Ankara-based diplomats, said theshort-term component was 9.6 billion dlrs at end-1986, up from6.6 billion.    Much of Turkey's debt is denominated in currencies otherthan the dollar. Canevi said the increase expressed in dollarterms was partly attributable to the fall in value of the U.S.Currency.    While the rise in total debt was about 24 pct in dollarterms, it would be only 11 pct if expressed in special drawingrights and would represent a fall of 11 pct if expressed in theWest German mark, he said.    On the rise in short-term debt, Canevi said half the amountwas in Turkish citizens' foreign exchange deposits. "On a macrolevel it is a liability but it is not really a liabilitybecause it will be repaid in Turkish lira," he added.    Canevi was Governor of the Turkish Central Bank until lastNovember, when he was promoted to Under-secretary for theTreasury and Foreign Trade, a key economic management post.    Canevi listed what he called the assets of the Turkisheconomy, including liberalisation in the last three years, thecountry's geographical position and the strength of itsagriculture and manpower skills.    The debt picture was one of three liabilities, he said,along with the failure to reduce inflation swiftly andimpatience. "We are an impatient nation ... We should be patientenough to achieve better results," he added.    Wholesale prices on an index issued by Canevi's departmentrose 27.4 pct in the year to February, compared with 33.3 pct ayear earlier.    On inflation, Canevi said: "We have chosen to reduceinflation in a moderate way. We could have reduced it in twoyears from 25 pct to five pct but we needed growth ... Wealready have high unemployment."    "I don't blame people who are sick and tired of living withinflation but it was 100 per cent before. The trend is down, solet's be patient and not distort overall policies and we willachieve our targets in one or two years," he said. REUTER&#3;

G.I. Valentchits, Deputy Trade Minister at the Sovietembassy, told Reuters a report earlier this week thatTsvetmetpromexport had asked the Philippine government whetherit could help rehabilitate or operate NMIC was incorrect.    "It is the other way round," Valentchits said.    He said the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) andthe Philippine National Bank (PNB), which own NMIC, hadapproached the Soviet state-owned firm in August last year.    "We studied the question and asked the banks in which fieldand what area they can help in the project," Valentchits said.    He said there had been no reply yet from NMIC and the talkswere "only just initial."    NMIC President Arthur Aguilar and other company officialswere not available for comment.    Manila banking sources said the situation was serious atNMIC, set up by DBP and PNB in August 1984 after the two banksforeclosed on the assets of Marinduque Mining and IndustrialCorp over a 17 billion peso obligation.    The bankers said NMIC itself has recently filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for placing thecompany under receivership and the suspension of its debtpayments in order to protect it from threats of foreclosure.    Business Day newspaper said the latest credits extended toNMIC include a 127 mln dlr loan, with Chemical Bank as the leadagent.    The newspaper said another 33 mln dlr loan was lead managedby Citicorp.    It said the government's privatisation program has listedNMIC at a price of at least 700 mln dlrs, adding that foreigninvestors were wary of taking over the ailing nickel firm.    The bankers said NMIC was currently burdened with debts ofat least 15.8 billion pesos and is facing 10 civil lawsuits forforeclosures from major creditors.    The Business Bulletin newspaper said the firm had assetstotalling 12.2 billion pesos, while DBP and PNB exposures withthe firm were estimated at 14.9 billion pesos.    NMIC has not operated its plant in the southern Philippinessince March 1986 after workers struck demanding payment ofsalaries delayed because of the firm's financial difficulties.

reut2-007.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs, The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan andKorea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic andcurrency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries,economists said.    "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will bescreaming at those countries about their exports," said SteveCerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.    Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.    Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoricagainst Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow theircurrencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.    The thrust has shifted to those newly industrializedcountries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against thecurrencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the mainfocus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning toclose the competiveness gap for American goods.    U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that heexpects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.    But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on theirown doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have notrisen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiariesof soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese andKorean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.    "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington wasJapan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing," said Robert Chandross, ofLloyds Bank PLC.    Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singaporeand Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.    The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral tradedeficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.    And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend iscontinuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. Thegap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.    Lately both nations have said they will take steps todefuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing manyof the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut importtariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.    Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said lastweek that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three tofive years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.    For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cuttariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 andtry to diversify exports. But vice economic minister WangChien-Shien said last month that he still does not expectTaiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.    The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textilesand electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in thearea of "big-ticket" manufactured goods, notably cars.    Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America-- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.    "The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. Whentheir exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturingbase. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said BobWendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.    The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports,72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of itstelecommunications equipment.    A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan andSouth Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.    While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with theU.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.    But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand inmarked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly intolarge bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall tradeand current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.    Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, andKorea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.    Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.    "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have beenat Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.    February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powersexorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.    But this two-pronged approach has drawn little responsefrom the two nations so far and, in any case, will only workwith a sizeable lag, economists say.    The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's andKorea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which ispegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct sinceSeptember 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.    But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat againstthe U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.    "We've not seen any lessening of competition from thosecountries that we can attribute to currency changes," saidBethlehem Steel's Wendt.    And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use theirhefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.    Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism willget given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard tosee that anything will be passed much before year-end. And thenthe question is, will it have teeth?" one economist said.    Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, MADAGASCAR COFFEE PRODUCTION SEEN LOWER IN 1987, Madagascar's available coffeeoutput is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agriculturalservices and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas,Agriculture Ministry sources said.    This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside,they said.    The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987,but they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes lastyear from 41,662 in 1985.    Low yields from the country's ageing coffee plantations andprevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix alsocontributed to the poor performance, the sources said.    They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar's coffee busheswere planted before 1930.    The sources said Madagascar was still a long way fromreaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year andthe export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government's1986-1990 five-year plan.    In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, thegovernment has decided to plant 20,000 hectares withhigh-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sourcessaid.    The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed atproducing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a lowcaffeine content.    The sources added that Madagascar's plan to export roastedcoffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems. Only650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year. Reuter&#3;

On the grounds of increasing production, he said, "I wouldrule out a gasoline tax."    Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil importfee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- theloss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil pricesand a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billiondlrs.    He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, onnew and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be acheap way to spur domestic production.    He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year.    Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance tothe White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool.

In addition to the land reported damaged, another 15 mlnacres are unprotected and susceptible to wind damage, 34 pctmore than the 1970-84 average, but about one mln acres lessthan last year.    The states hardest hit were in the Northern Plains, wherewind damaged 2.4 mln acres, an increase of 1.5 mln acres overthe amount reported a year ago, the department said.    Suffering the most damage in the Northern Plains wereMontana (1.3 mln acres), and North Dakota (518,500 acres.)    Of the five Southern Plains states, only Colorado reportedan increase in wind-damaged land over last year, it said.    Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas reported a reductionin damaged land, due in part to emergency conservation tillagepractices and in part to rainfall and weather conditions.    Of the land damaged, 96.2 pct was cropland, 3.5 pctrangeland, and 0.9 pct was other land.

Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlrprofit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on thesale of a joint interest in an Australian food company andlower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an earlyretirement program initiated a year ago.

reut2-007.sgm, EC MINISTERS AGREE NEED FOR BIG STEEL CLOSURES, European Community (EC) industryministers today declared there is a need for a massive round ofclosures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-countrybloc into reasonable balance with demand.    The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntaryplant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Euroferwhich it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs.    Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to thescheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis fordiscussion, but did not go nearly far enough.    Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure ofplants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes,provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the ECor national governments for redundancy and other social costs.    But EC Executive Commission sources said IndustryCommissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mlntonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and shouldbe closed by the end of 1990.    He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpointthe scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products,typically produced in plants employing thousands of people.    The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysisthat four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have toclose.    They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should beexpanded and developed through meetings among the industrybody, the Commission and representatives of member states.    However, diplomats said it was clear from today'sdiscussions that such meetings will be difficult.    They said member states are split on whether to reduce thescope of a quota production system, which at present protectsEC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct oftheir products, while talks on the closure plan proceed.    It was also clear that there will be tough talks on whichEC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and onhow much funding for help to those thrown out of work shouldcome from Community coffers.    German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steelindustry, the largest in the EC, should not sufferproportionately more than others, German sources said.    But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw,insists that the profitability of companies should be takeninto account.    The state owned British Steel Corporation, benefitting frommassive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts, iscurrently one of the few EC steel companies in the black.    Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a jointstatement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in theindustry. Reuter&#3;

Repligen said the human tests could begin by the end of theyear.    "We are sufficiently encouraged and impressed by the workto date to go ahead with a clinical trial," said Michael Egan,manager of business development for Repligen, a biotechnologycompany.    Repligen's Egan said the vaccine contains a subfragment ofthe protein coat of the AIDS virus. In animal tests, whichincluded primates, Egan said the vaccine provoked neutralizingantibodies to the AIDS virus and broader cellular immunity.    Egan said the approach Repligen is using to deliver itsvaccine, using standard vaccine methods, may be safer thanvaccines using a live smallpox virus to carry proteins found onthe surface coat of the AIDS virus.    Yesterday, Bristol-Myers Co &lt;BMY> said it would seekregulatory permission to test its AIDS vaccine, which uses asmallpox virus, in humans by the end of the month.

Snowpack and precipitation were well below normalthroughout much of the West as of last week.    Eight of the 12 states in which the department collectsdata reported snowpack and precipitation at three-quarters orless of normal.    It said unless late winter snows or spring rains bringrelief, these states can expect possible water shortages thissummer.    Major water users, including agricultural producers,municipalities and industry, should begin conservation measuresnow to avoid water rationing later, USDA said.    The department said California, one of the country's majoragricultural producers, is the driest, with snowpack andprecipitation so far this year at less than half of normal.    Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon andWashington also report significant shortages despite pockets ofnear normal to above noral rainfall in some areas, thedepartment said.

reut2-007.sgm, BRITOIL SEES LOWER U.K. EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE, Britoil Plc's &lt;BTOL.L> explorationexpenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about athird of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure wouldremain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walkersaid.    He told reporters following the release of the company's1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986levels.    U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in1985.    Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinarycharge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The resultswere slightly better than analysts forecast and the sharefirmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman SirPhilip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986had made the period extremely difficult but the company hadcome through remarkably well.    Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, theconditions would be right for a substantially improvedperformance this year.    He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, whenthey were normally weaker, made him "a bit encouraged" about theprospects for future levels.    Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the pricestayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.    Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcementof a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by thelatter part of April.    End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil comparedwith 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that thisincluded a revised definition of reserves.    If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, thereserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrelspreviously.    Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from arestated 3,660 billion.&#3;

UBS has become the second foreign firm to manage an issuein the domestic debt market this year, following DaiwaSecurities America Inc. However, investment bankers noted thatUBS was the first foreigner to break into the U.S. market whenit won a competitive bidding in June 1986.

Bradt, a local trader and member of the board of governors,assumed his duties yesterday and met reporters.    "If all four exchanges become one, we would save incrediblecosts and become more competitive to Chicago," Bradt toldReuters.    Bradt was referring to a merger among the four exchanges atthe Commodity Exchange Center, an idea that has been discussedintermittently for several years.    The four exchanges -- the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee,Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, and the New York Cotton Exchange inaddition to the NYMEX -- are all located on a single floor atthe World Trade Center.    Bradt said he would address the problem of space shortageson the exchange floor by reallocating booth space among themembers, including sharing of booths.    "If you are a company with potential business for the Merc,you should get a booth," he said, adding that an exchangecommittee is studying the problem.

He told a press conference that in confirming theCommission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988,he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989.    The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss inthe current financial year but this could be carried over andmet from next year's revenues.    This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which costthe canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This includedeight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest beingspent on earth-moving operations to prevent any furtherlandslides.    He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation andhe described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was anythreat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future.    Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillardcut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, addingthat he expected the canal board to determine whether and whenthe canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.

reut2-007.sgm, SEC DETAILS CHARGES AGAINST JEFFERIES, Federal regulators said BoydJefferies, who resigned as head of his Los Angeles brokeragefirm, took part in schemes to manipulate the price of a stockand in a stock "parking" plot with inside trader Ivan Boesky.    In a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in NewYork, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Jefferiesagreed with an unidentified person to have his firm buy up alarge chunk of stock being issued in a public offering.    Under the agreement, the firm, Jefferies and Co, drove theprice of the stock up by one-eighth point by buying four blocksof the stock at or near the close of trading, the SEC said.    Jefferies and Co's purchases of the unidentified stockaccounted for 66 pct of the total trading volume of the stockon that day and were aimed at manipulation, the SEC said.    The complaint did not identify the company whose stock wasbeing traded, but said that the Jefferies and Co purchases tookplace sometime last year when another unidentified company,which owned a controlling interest in the company, sold severalmillion shares of the stock in a secondary public offering.    The stock purchases were made on the New York StockExchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange, the SEC said.    The person who made the alleged stock manipulationagreement with Jefferies was also not identified.    But the person was later billed by Jefferies and Co in aphony invoice marked for investment banking services for theexact amount the firm lost on the deal when it later sold thestock on the open market, the SEC said.    The payment, the amount of which was also not revealed inthe complaint, was made later by another unidentified personafter Jefferies sent a second invoice for a lesser amount, theSEC said. The firm recorded the payment as "other income," itsaid.    William McLucas, associate director of enforcement at theSEC, declined to say why the agency decided against revealingthe identities of other persons and companies involved in thestock manipulation scheme.    "We just made a determination that this was the way to goat this time," McLucas told Reuters.    The complaint went into far greater detail in its chargesthat Jefferies agreed with Boesky to "park" stock at eachother's firms. Parking, or warehousing, stock, refers to dealswhere stock is held by one person or firm under an arrangementwhere it is actually under the control of someone else.    Under the agreement between Jefferies and Boesky, Jefferiesand Co would hold stock owned by Seemala Corp, one of Boesky'sbrokerage firms, for 31 days, after which Seemala would "buy"the stock back, the SEC said.    Seemala realized all gains and sustained all losses on thestock held by Jefferies and Co during the period, agreed tocompensate Jefferies and Co for carrying the stock and to paymore than twice Jefferies and Co's usual commission, it said.    Seemala then agreed to hold stock owned by Jefferies and Cofor a month under terms about the same as the deal in whichSeemala agreed to park its stock at Jefferies and Co, it said.    The agreement, which violated several securities laws,allowed Seemala to create a false appearance that no longerheld the stock and could meet the SEC's net capitalrequirements, the SEC said.    Jefferies wanted Seemala to hold some of its stock, the SECsaid, so that Jefferies and Co could meet its net capitalneeds, the agency said.    On March 12, 1985, Seemala "sold" Jefferies 810,000 sharesoc Cooper Laboratories Inc for 11.7 mln dlrs, 600,000 shares ofSouthland Financial Corp for 17.3 mln dlrs and 500,000 sharesof G.D. Searle and Co for 27.1 mln dlrs, it said.    On March 20, Jefferies and Co "sold" Seemala 185,500 sharesof American Broadcasting Co for 19.6 mln dlrs, 210,000 sharesof Ideal Basic Industries Inc for 2.9 mln dlrs, 300,000 sharesof ITT Corp for 9.8 mln dlrs, 105,000 shares of PhillipsPetroleum Co for 4.0 mln dlrs, 70,000 shares of Pioneer Corpfor 2.1 mln dlrs and 300,000 shares of Texas Oil and Gas Corpfor 5.3 mln dlrs, the SEC said.    The value of Seemala's stock at the time of the transferswas 56 mln dlrs, while Jefferies and Co's stock was worth 43mln dlrs at the time, the SEC said.    Within a month, Seemala and Jefferies and Co unwound mostof the stock transfers with each others firms, the SEC said.    But a major hitch developed in the deal when the price ofSearle stock, which Jefferies and Co was holding for Seemala,dipped sharply, it said.    On March 26 Seemala "bought" back its Searle stock for 23.4mln dlrs, resulting in a 3.6 mln dlr loss for Jefferies and Co,the SEC said. Seemala then allowed Jefferies and Co to "buy"back some it the stock Seemala was holding for it at a 647,812dlr gain and Boesky's firms later paid the Jefferies firm threemln dlrs, which it called "fees," it said.    Among the violations Jefferies committed in the schemes,were net capital, record keeping, public disclosure and marginrequirements, the SEC said.    Under the settlement of the civil SEC's charges, which wasannounced simultaneously with the filing of the complaint,Jefferies and his firm did not have to admit or deny guilt.    But they agreed to a court order barring them from furthersecurities law violations.    Jefferies also agreed to get out of the securities businessfor at least five years. Reuter&#3;

Moody's said that while Merrill's absolute earnings wouldcontinue to increase, the house's profitability will lag thatof its peers. And Merrill's attempts to improve profitabilitywill be constrained by accelerating competition, Moody's said.    Moody's also said Merrill Lynch would continue toaggressively commit its capital to such merchant bankingactivities as bridge financing.    "These activities elevate the risk content of Merrill'sbalance sheet at the same time as low profitability inhibitsthe strong internal capital generation which may be necessaryto support business expansion efforts," Moody's said.    The rating agency noted, however, that Merrill's franchiseretains significant value and gives the firm strong proprietarysecurities placement power. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, U.N. ADVISES MINES TO FIGHT METAL SUBSTITUTES, Mining companies may have todevelop specialty metals and metal-containing products ifplastics and other substitutes are not to make further inroadsin their markets, according to the United Nations.    In a report by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar onworld mineral resources, U.N. experts termed conditions in thenon-fuel mineral industry "unlike anything that has beenexperienced for the last half century."    Effects of slower global economic growth were compounded bydiminishing use of the major and base metals and thedevelopment of substitutes in traditional markets, it said.    The report was prepared for a nine-day session next monthof the U.N. committee on natural resources, an organ of theEconomic and Social Council.    The gap between world productive capacity and demand wouldeventually be eliminated by closing mines, the reportpredicted.    "Although for the most part mining companies have been slowto develop specialty metals and metal-containing products andto develop markets for such products, it seems that suchactivities will be needed if plastics and other metalsubstitutes are not to make further inroads into thetraditional markets for the major and base metals," the expertssaid.    "Integration of metal-producing and manufacturingenterprises between and among developed economies seems to be alikely consequence."

reut2-007.sgm, FRENCH MINISTER RENEWS ECONOMIC CONTROVERSY, French Social Affairs and Labour MinisterPhilippe Seguin has renewed a controversy over whether Franceis positioning itself for an economic U-turn, saying it waspossible to boost domestic demand without giving rise tonegative economic effects.    Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's spokesman, Denis Baudouin,on Monday sparked speculation of a reflation hitherto excludedby the government when he said ministers were agreed on thedesirability of "relaunching the economy."     The Finance Ministry, however, swiftly ruled out the optionof reinflation policies to boost domestic demand, which weretried and abandoned by the previous Socialist government.    Earlier today sources close to Finance Minister EdouardBalladur reiterated policy remained one of restoring soundfinances and enhancing economic competitiveness.    But political analysts said Baudouin's statements showedgrowing divisions over electorally sensitive social issuesamong the rightist RPR-UDF coalition, ahead of its bid nextyear to capture the presidency from Socialist presidentFrancois Mitterrand.    While the government has achieved lower inflation, a betterforeign trade balance and an overwhelmingly successfulprivatisation programme, unemployment has continued to edgeupwards, reaching its present record rate of 10.9 pct, withmore than 2.5 mln jobless.    Seguin, who holds direct responsibility for dealing withunemployment, told a press lunch, "Everything depends on whatyou call reflation...One can arrive at the results of areflation without passing through the perverse effects of areflation."    He said conservative prime minister Jacques Chirac wouldannounce in the next few days a package of capital endowmentsfor state-owned enterprises including public works and motorwaybuilding.  And while sources at Seguin's ministry said thepackage could total 12 billion francs for 1987, sources closeto Balladur, making no mention of public works, said only 8.6billion francs had been set aside for capital endowments.    Seguin said the advantage of public works was that theywere non-inflationary and had a fast job-creating power. REUTER&#3;

It said a spermicide used in INKEY's condoms contains aningredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission ofAIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West Germanpublication, Aids Forschung. But it said the article wasabout the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or thecondoms made by INKEY.    The company also said it is changing its name toEurocapital Corp shortly.    Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in aU.S.-based &lt;Europharmaceutical Co>. INKEY and an affiliate ownthe remaining shares of the company, which was set up todistribute condoms and vaginal products that are made, or arebeing developed by INKEY.    The agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to Inkey forthe distributorship. The first 500,000 dlr payment is due 30days after the products are approved by the Food and DrugAdministration. It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon filewith the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approvalprocess to be a lengthy one.    The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide iscurrently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelatedto condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not beentested in a spermicide.    Inkey's condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brandname, "Carlton." The exclusive distribution contract for theproducts runs for three years and is renewable for one-yearperiods, the company said.    It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but havenot gone on sale in other European countries.    It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have theresources to make the payments under the distribution agreementor fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval fromthe FDA.

reut2-007.sgm, KENTUCKY SMELTERS GET RELIEF ON HIGHER RATES, Owners of two aluminum smelters inKentucky received temporary relief from higher electric ratesafter a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a ratehike to (Big Rivers Electric Corp) of Henderson, Ky.    But the owners of the smelters, (National SouthwireAluminum Co) and Alcan Aluminium Ltd &lt;AL>, said furtherviability of the operations would depend in part upon how therate case is eventually settled.    "We're hoping for no rate increases but we can't say forsure. It's still possible we'll have to close the smelter," aNational Southwire spokesman said. He said there were othervariables to consider in any decision whether to close orcontinue the smelter, located in Hawesville, about 60 mileswest of Louisville.    National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc&lt;NII>, which holds about 55 pct, and (Southwire Co), whichholds the rest, the spokesman said.    A spokesman for Montreal-based Alcan said, "The decision is48 pages long and is in legal-ese, so it certainly will be along time before we can make a decision" about what it meansfor the Sebree smelter in Henderson, about 100 miles west ofLouisville. "But we're delighted that Big Rivers Electric wasdenied the requested rate increase."    A spokesman for the utility, a cooperative that generatesand wholesales electricity to four distributors, said therequested increase was 7.5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates.    The Kentucky Public Service Commission, in denying theincrease, asked the utility to meet with creditors, whichinclude Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and Irving Bank Corp&lt;V>, and the smelters, to renegotiate a rate plan, the utilityspokesman said.    The commission suggested that Big Rivers Electric work outa flexible rate schedule with the smelters that would indextheir electric costs to the price of aluminum, he said.    "We have always been amenable to try, as far as we can, toassure that the two aluminum smelters remain viable," he said.    No meetings are scheduled and none have been plannedbetween the utility, its creditors and the aluminum plantowners. The commission has set a hearing on the rate issue forJuly 28. Reuter&#3;

Gary Eder, 41, PaineWebber's highest paid broker between1982-86, was indicted last week on charges of conspiracy andfalsifying brokerage records.    Eder, who resigned from the firm earlier this year,admitted he received cash from various clients, and convertedthe funds to smaller amounts to avoid reporting requirements bythe U.S. Internal Revenue Service.    Eder said he did not profit directly from the transactionsexcept for the commissions he received.    U.S. District Judge Edmund Palmieri scheduled May 27 forsentencing. Eder could receive up to five years in jail on eachcount and 260,000 dlrs in fines.    Eder had been accused of plotting with unidentifiedsupervisors at PaineWebber to prevent the filing of currencytransaction reports with the IRS. Under U.S. law, cashtransactions of 10,000 dlrs or more must be reported to theIRS.    David Spears, the Federal prosecutor in charge of the case,said Eder received cash from customers in amounts up to 70,000dlrs at one time, and then broke the cash down into amountsunder 10,000 dlrs and put the money into accounts on severaldifferent days.

reut2-007.sgm, TRIPLE-EXPIRATION MAY JOLT STOCK MARKET, The stock market could be jolted oneway or another on Friday as the so-called triple witchingexpiration raises the specter of volatile movement.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average could soar or plunge asmuch as 100 points, or both, or even remain static, accordingto analysts of the stock and stock index futures markets.    The simultaneous expiration of March stock index futurescontracts, options on these futures and options on the indexesthemselves, along with options on individual stocks, hascreated a mad scramble during several previous "witchinghours."    Upon expiration of these vehicles, investment managers mustfind a place for their funds, and in the past the final hourhas seen a tremendous surge in New York Stock Exchange volume.    Analysts said the overriding influence of the stockmarket's steady climb this year -- and the absence ofworthwhile investment alternatives -- may indicate that themajor players will look to buy into the stock market as thefinal hour transpires this friday.    "I think there will be a substantial swap out of futures(positions) and into stocks," Jeffrey Miller, of Miller TabakHirsch and Co said. "(But) I've got a streak of four or five ina row of being right, so I'm bound to be wrong."    The feeling among some analysts is that the largest moneymanagers will do the same thing they did at December'sexpiration when they plunged their multi-billion dollar fundsinto the stock market.    "Last time, during triple-expiration, there was atremendous amount of stock sold, which was offset by huge buyprograms late," said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Inc analystWilliam Marcus.    Some stock funds quickly place newly arrived investmentdollars into buying futures positions, Miller said. Then, uponthe expiration of the futures, the manager looks to transformthat into a stock portfolio, he said.    The coming month is also a seasonally strong period for thestock market, Stotler and Co analyst David Hightower said,because of the influx of income tax refunds.    Although Hightower recommended steering clear of tradingduring the witching hour, he suggested buying if the marketplunges, believing that the slide would only be temporary.    Marcus said it was difficult to make a prediction as towhich way the market will go on Friday, partly because manyinvestors will be engaging in "window-dressing."    The public disclosure of order imbalances in individualstocks a half hour before the close may reveal an opportunityto those investors seeking either to buy or get rid of stocks,offsetting whatever impact the initial imbalances show.    Analysts said efforts by exchanges to quell the volatilityon triple-expirations are unlikely to substantially alter theimpact of futures and options on the stock market. Moneymanagers are sure to find other types of loopholes that emergeunder the new rules, they said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, EASED RESTRICTIONS TO CREATE NEW PHONE SERVICES, Consumers may benefit from newtelephone services if business restrictions against theregional Bell companies are eased, but safeguards against ratehikes may be needed, congressional and industry analysts say.    An easing of the restrictions by the U.S. District Courtwould help bring new services to markets that the regionalfirms are currently prohibited from serving, the analysts say.    But consumer groups add that there is a danger the regionalcompanies would raise rates to subsidize entry into new marketsand safeguards would be needed to prevent that.    Brian Moir, a spokesman for the InternationalCommunications Association, a national group of telephoneusers, said, "If there are no safeguards, there will be higherrates, less competition and less consumer choice."    The seven regional Bell companies created from the breakupof American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T> in 1984 have beenprohibited by the terms of the divestiture decree frommanufacturing equipment, offering computerized informationservices or providing long-distance service.    U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who presided over thedivestiture and continues to enforce its terms, is currentlyconsidering a Justice Department recommendation to eliminatethe restrictions except on long-distance service within a Bellholding company's local service region.    In separate filings last week, the regional Bells askedGreene to remove restrictions, while industry and consumergroups including the Consumer Federation of America joined ATTin asking that all or most of them be retained.    ATT, which has about an 80 pct share in the interstatelong-distance market, said in its filing it would not opposeentry by the Bell companies into computerized informationservices but was against their participation in long-distanceservices and manufacturing equipment. ATT does not offercomputerized information services.    ATT has asked the Federal Communications Commission, in aseparate proceeding, to reduce price and rate regulations thathave dominated the long-distance business for many years.    Greene is expected to reach a decision on whether to easerestrictions this year, possibly this summer, analysts said.    "The restrictions prevent people who can provide servicesfrom providing them," said a congressional aide.    However, a major concern among consumer groups andlawmakers is that the companies may subsidize those newbusinesses from higher charges to their customers.    "We're talking about activities funded directly orindirectly off the backs of ratepayers," said Moir.    One congressional aide said he was not worried aboutsubsidizing new businesses from profits, but he was concernedthat the Bell companies may overcharge consumers so that theycan invest in new services.    Some analysts said accounting regulations would protectconsumers against cross-subsidization by the Bell companies.    "Those are types of things that really do need review," saidGerry Salemme, an aide with the House Telecommunications,Consumer Protection and Finance Subcommittee.    He added that the House would hold hearings later this yearto examine the potential effects of reduced restrictions.    Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation, which representsmore than 200 consumer groups, said accounting regulations wereinadequate because accountants could not separate equipmentemployed for traditional and new services.    "We have yet to see adequate regulatory safeguards thatexist that prevent cross-subsidization by the Bell companies,"Kimmelman said. "You're either asking for great increases inrates or a great opportunity for cross-subsidization."    One congressional aide expressed concern that lifting ofthe restrictions would lead to joint ventures between U.S. andforeign firms in manufacturing telecommunications equipment andthat could lead to a loss of American jobs. He suggested somesafeguards may be needed to protect against that happening. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, FED'S JOHNSON SAYS BUDGET DEFICIT CUT ESSENTIAL TO INT'L ECONOMIC COOPERATION, 
reut2-007.sgm, NEW RUBBER PACT TO BE FORMALLY ADOPTED TOMORROW, A new International Natural RubberAgreement (INRA) will be formally adopted tomorrow, chairman ofthe negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said.    "The successful negotiation of the new agreement representsa significant step forward in international economiccooperation," he told a news conference. The new INRA is toreplace the current one which expires in October.    Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under theauspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a newaccord last weekend.    Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicativeprices set in the present pact.    Price levels will continue to be expressed in the jointMalaysian/Singapore currency, he added.    The new agreement also maintains the basic structure ofprice ranges -- the "may sell" and "may buy" points at plus andminus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the "must sell"and "must buy" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it.    Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives thatwere set in the present accord. "The most important of these areto stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth betweendemand and supply," he said. The buffer stock remains the soleinstrument of market intervention for price stabilisation andits maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xutoadded.    At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt intwo years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to beresolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the referenceprice.    It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference priceevery 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals.    The extent of the adjustment was also modified.    Under the present agreement if the daily market indicatorprice has been above the upper intervention ("may sell") price(currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lowerintervention price ("may buy") price (171 cents at present) forsix months, the reference price is then revised by five pct orwhatever amount the International Natural Rubber Councildecides.    Under the new pact, the adjustment under thesecircumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on ahigher adjustment.    Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of threepct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higherpercentage.    Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers hadstrongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the referenceprice and the "lower indicative price" (or floor price) of 150cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes.    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn lastFriday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend.    Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details ofthe new pact.    On the question of conditions for entry into force of thenew INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governmentsaccounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of worldimports approved or ratified the new agreement before it becameoperational.    The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET, Sugar which EC producers plan to sellinto intervention may be offered by the European Commission forsale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in itslatest sugar review.    The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a verynominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to theintervention price, with detrimental consequences forproducers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as anattempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrenderedsugar.    The Commission may also take other steps to dissuadeproducers from their chosen course, such as removing the timelimit on storage contracts, which presently means thatintervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of productionquotas being reduced.    If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders forexport, the restitutions would have to be higher than those atrecent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the differencebetween the EC price and the world market price, the extracosts might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.    The producers might have to repay these costs throughproduction levies and the proposed special elimination levy,Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costscould be recovered under EC rules.    The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes ofsugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with theEC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed tobridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form ofprotest designed to force the Commission's hand.    In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered forintervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensurethat the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,West German producers face a further price reduction in Julywith a probable revaluation of the "green" mark.    Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem isnot expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared totraders for some years that the EC's export policy isinsufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, itsays.    The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand byincreasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says,suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cutdown the amount of "unnecessary bureaucracy" surrounding theexport tender system.

reut2-007.sgm, GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING, The Association of German CooperativeBanks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rateswould continue to remain low for the time being.    It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strongforeign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors inthe economy that could affect the long-term capital market.    The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion forhigher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflationlate this year could give very slight grounds for a rise innominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.    The association said generally low interest rates,prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expectedstrong domestic demand led it to believe that the investmentclimate would remain friendly and the economy would continueits slow but very sure growth.    The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interestrates down on the short-term money market although its policieshad exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,which was so important for investment financing and thus forthe course of the economy, it said.    In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policyhad in influencing the longer-term capital market, theassociation saw little sense in wanting to boost the economythrough a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.    On the other hand it also saw no reason for stickingdogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.    The association said time would show to what extentspeculative foreign money and short-term invested domesticmoney would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbankcould hold down money market rates with the highly effectiveinstrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, U.K. MONEY DATA MAY EASE RATE CUT, ANALYSTS SAY, Slower than expected growth in Britain'snarrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur afurther cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling'svalue requires such a move, economic analysts said.    M0, the only targeted money supply measure left afterChancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the officialtarget for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budgetspeech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February.    On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct.    "The M0 data are much better than we expected," said RobertThomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities.    He and other analysts said while the better than expectedM0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a newinterest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move.    Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despitebuoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pctafter a fall of the same size in January.    Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations inconsumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was notan adequate indicator to determine interest rates.    "The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 isimportant ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rateand the election which call the tune," Lloyds Merchant bankchief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment.    Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett,said in a comment: "It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond tosignals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange ratetrends is necessary before action is taken."    "With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres aremade in response to signals from this narrow money variable,the City has been forced to take it seriously," he added.    Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end oflast year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared.    This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K.Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up thepound above unofficial targets, analysts said.    Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreedbetween finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada attheir Paris meeting last month, they added.  U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since theParis agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday whenforeign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cutin 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget.    They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers andanalysts expect them to shed another half-point in the comingweek.    Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher thanexpected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed theannual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previoustarget of 11 to 15 pct.    Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate theimprovement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past fewmonths had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only bedrawn after revised data are released on March 31.    Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased towatch the sterling M3 target, and Lawson's move to scrap italtogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of itscredibility as a key factor in monetary policy.

reut2-007.sgm, U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT, A statement yesterday by Secretaryof State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers thatU.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced wassignificant in that he recognized the importance of the Sovietmarket and the need for U.S. prices to be at world marketlevels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.    They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitlyendorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthybecause they were not negative towards such action.    In response to a query on what the State Department'sposition is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz toldthe leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers thatprices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.    The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, hasbought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining theprice was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fallto sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the exportenhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.    Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheatoffer last year and has been reported to be one of the majorobstacles in making another subsidy overture to the SovietUnion, grain industry sources said.    Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheatoffer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly inrecent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures roseanother 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.    "I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly arecognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to theSoviet Union," said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say thatsomebody is going to buy your product if they can get the samething at a lower price somewhere else," Shultz told the farmleaders. "That is our approach in negotiations with theSoviets," he said.    If those comments do signal that the State Department is nolonger opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer toMoscow, an industry lobbyst said.    National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautiousattitude towards the secretary's comments.    "His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in ourjudgment promise any immediate action on EEP," an official withthe wheat group said.    The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that "there issignificance in that fact that we haven't seen any significantnegative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets."    In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary ofAgriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their requestthat the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, theofficials said.    An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who isreported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,said that the Shultz comments "are consistent with what he(Shultz) has taught for years as an economist," but said theydon't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.    Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide toLyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.    But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments mayindicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.    "If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This ispotentially a positive development," a commodity source said. Reuter&#3;

The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority'scereals management committee today.    The tax had been introduced last September at the same timeas a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exportsof maize to Spain from other EC member countries.    The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported intoSpain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies frombeing reexported back to them.    The sources added that Spain had received no answer fromthe committee to its request that tenders be opened for thesale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.    The request will be considered at the committee's nextmeeting, the commission sources said.    Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes ofmaize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-ECproducer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.

reut2-007.sgm, UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS, The "cross field allowance" relief onPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRTpaying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.    The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct ofqualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability ofother fields. It is restricted to new offshore developmentsoutside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field notpaying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directlybenefit in PRT saving on an existing field.    "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participatorsin those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said,adding that the timing of development of such fields may beadvanced.    The government would in effect be subsidising thesedevelopments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure beforecorporation tax, the report said.    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit isof timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields willbe reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields willrise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.    In a study on probable fields, the report said that whenthe rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-payingfield such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in theU.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for asmall non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9pct.    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there willbe a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not onlywill these costs be unavailable for offset against the field'sfuture profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs willbe lost.    Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development startswill have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a latertime. Reuter&#3;
reut2-007.sgm, CONGRESSMEN URGE U.S. SOYBEAN PROGRAM CHANGES, Several leading farm-stateCongressmen said they will press the U.S. AgricultureDepartment to implement some kind of marketing loan to makesoybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.    Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairmanDan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen andrepresentatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on thesubject in the next two weeks.    "Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to dosomething without legislation," Glickman told the hearing.    The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs perbushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.    David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, presidentsaid USDA must make changes in the soybean program.    The current soybean program "gave us the worst of bothworlds," ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate istoo high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion ofsoybean production in South America, he said. At the same time,the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any incomesupport for soybean farmers, Haggard said.    "We need some kind of market loan," he added.    The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the AgricultureSecretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDAso far has resisted pressure to use the authority.    Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA,but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if theywould seriously consider offering a marketing loan.    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said thesoybean situation is a "dilemna" which has been studiedextensively by the department. But he did not say what, if anychanges, are under consideration.    In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways otherthan a marketing loan which should be considered to helpsoybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment,or a direct payment program.    Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity CreditCorporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will riseto 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu ofsoybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.    "Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entiresoybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987," Haggard said.    However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious inmaking soybean program changes that might allow the EuropeanCommunity to challenge the U.S. program under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.    He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybeanproduction and loss of that market would be devastating.    The Reagan administration has given "mixed signals" onwhether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could besuccessfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.    While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per buloan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorseda proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a sixdlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.    The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the rankingRepublican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. EdwardMadigan of Illinois.    Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to takesome action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loancould mean a substantial increase in budget costs.    Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut oneto 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and thereforemust fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.    Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bucombined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price mightfall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost thegovernment a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costswould decline as market prices recovered. Reuter&#3;

The current probe stems from the conviction last month ofan Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co employee, it said.    In the trial of the Allegheny Pepsi employee, ArmandGravely on October 28, 1986, Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Coand eight of its employees, including some high rankingofficers, were identified as unindicted co-conspirators in theprice fixing scheme, Coca-Cola Enterprises said.

reut2-007.sgm, TEXAS COMMERCE &lt;TCB> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987, Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said thatrelatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger withChemical New York Corp &lt;CHL> would help 1987 earnings increasefrom last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs.    Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview withReuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expectedearnings to increase.    "We would anticipate that this year would be an improvementover last because we are stronger," Love said, referring toTexas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical.The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, willlower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15basis points, Love said.    The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisitionby a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approvedinterstate banking effective January 1.    Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas'struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to reportprofits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank whichearned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc &lt;ALBN> lost 17.6mln dlrs, MCorp &lt;M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation &lt;FBT>, which is activelyseeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mlndlrs.    Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on itsenergy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank'snonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987.    "I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us," hesaid. "The fact that the real estate market is still movingaway suggests there could be some continuing growth ofnonperforming loans."    In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan lossesrelated to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energyloan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of thebank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43pct.    More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans,which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mlndlrs the year before, were in real estate.    Love said he believed the real estate loan problems forTexas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by thethird or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty officebuildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to fouryears, he said.    "I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oilat 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs abarrel," he said.    Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separatesubsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand itsholdings throughout Texas, offering additional products tobuild up its consumer banking business, Love said. "We areresuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,"he said.    In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank inMontgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area,and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. TexasCommerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in theDallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 memberbanks, he said.    One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announcedin December, InterFirst Corp &lt;IFC> and RepublicBank Corp &lt;RPT>,both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valuedat 570 mln dlrs.    The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank andInterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallasbanking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansionplans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. "We thinkwe can try to get a little part of their roost," he said.    The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce anedge in developing new consumer products, he said.    "We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more thanone million customers all over the state. Chemical will show ushow to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products," hesaid, referring to expansion of such existing products ascredit cards and investment banking. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, SPRINKEL URGES GREATER GROWTH IN JAPAN, EUROPE, Beryl Sprinkel, chairman ofthe president's council of economic advisors, said strongerdomestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed tohelp stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futherdollar declines.    "Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreignindustrial countries is needed to engender the much neededexpansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely onfurther dollar depreciation," he told the Futures IndustryAssociation.    Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand inJapan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-warperiod.    "Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrialcountries would help give balance to the current worldrecovery," he said.    Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made lastmonth to trading partners, he said recent figures showedJapan's economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of1986, "Not enough to sustain employment growth."    However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledgesand was moving toward more stimulative policies, including taxreform. "I suspect there will be further moves," he said.    Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S.government spending and for resistance to tax increases.    "Reducing the federal government budget deficit byexpenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginaltax rates achieved by tax reform," he said, adding that "a voteto increase to government expenditures is a vote against taxreform."    Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantiallyrestored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deteriorationof the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated.    However, he said that "sole reliance on dollar depreciationto reduce our trade deficit is not desirable," as it risksinflation in the United States and recession abroad.    "I am confident that further improvements in our tradeperformance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987," hesaid. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, willcome about largely from a swing in manufactures trade andpresent "serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners."    Western Europe, where manufactures output and employmenthave been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by theimprovement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said.    He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings inrates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirablepolicies that produced them. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, TALKING POINT/AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP>, American Express Co's plan to sell astake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be aprelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,analysts said.    American Express earlier said it has a generalunderstanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.    The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,as investors speculated on the possibility of more investmentin the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.    The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response tothe relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents aprice of 2.7 times book value.    Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insidertrading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8times book value.    American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. Forthe last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors ofa spinoff of part of Shearson.    Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit willbenefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasinglyimportant Tokyo financial markets.    "I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step," saidLong.    "What you will see probably in the future is AmericanExpress selling an additional 17 pct in the public market andhave a public vehicle for Shearson," Long said.    "Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitmentinto an illiquid situation," he said of Nippon.    Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake inShearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, likeother investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.    American express has said the total employees of shearsonwill expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, thatnumber is substantially lower than growth last year, a companyspokesman said.    American Express officials would not comment beyond astatement made this morning. That statement, however, did notclose off the possibility of a public offering or other optionfor Shearson.    David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possibleShearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believesthe firm will digest the Nippon investment first.    "I think they'll figure out what they're going to do withthe money they have," he said.    Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also saidAmerican Express could determine to sell shares to the public.    In its statement, the financial services giant said it iscontinuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition tothe investment by Nippon.    American Express said options under study range fromexpanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competitionto broadening its access to capital.    American Express also said the options reflect thecontinuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'worldwide financial services strategy.    Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding aJapanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake toSumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.    Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.    "Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. Theydon't have the money. There's just not enough internal capitalgrowth," said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows otherU.S. brokerage companies.    Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, areinterested in the expertise of American brokers. "Those(Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies havethe capital needs and the growth opportunities to use themoney. That's a nice marriage," he said.

reut2-007.sgm, MEXICO TO SIGN LOAN AMID CALLS FOR CHANGE, Mexico's 7.7 billion dlr loan packagewill be signed in New York tomorrow amid increasing calls fromboth creditors and debtors for a streamlining of the tortuousprocess of raising such jumbo loans, bankers said.    Pressure for change has mounted because the Mexican dealhas been even more difficult to syndicate than bankers feared.    Several tentative signing dates had to be scrapped and evennow, five months after the loan was agreed with a 13-bankadvisory committee on October 16, dozens of Mexico's some 400creditor banks worldwide are still refusing to participate.    The resistance to the deal must be seen alongside the factthat it is the largest loan for a Latin American debtor sincethe region's debt crisis flared up in 1983. Mexico will alsosign agreements to reschedule 52.3 billion dlrs of debt.    Moreover, as the first major package built on U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker's strategy of offering loans to countrieswilling to implement market-oriented, pro-growth policies,intense market scrutiny was only to be expected.    Still, the split within the banks' ranks came as a shock."This is not an unsuccessful operation, but we've had morebickering than ever," one senior banker commented.    Officers at small banks that have sold, swapped or orwritten down their Mexican loans say they see no reason whythey should throw good money after bad.    Major lenders counter that small banks must share theresponsibility of making new loans and cannot expect to keepreceiving interest on old debt unless they join in new ones.    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford saidrecently the reluctance of small banks at one point endangeredthe entire Mexican package. Things have improved, but moneycenter bankers are determined to keep hounding recalcitrantbanks even once the 7.7 billion dlr target has been reached.    The loan presently is about 98.5 pct committed. "People whoare outside shouldn't think they've been saved once we get over7.7 (billion dlrs)," one warned.    But rounding up "free-rider" banks entails such a hugedrain on management resources that more and more bankers areacknowledging that the syndicates may have to shrink.    One idea is to levy new loan contributions on the basis ofcurrent exposure instead of outstandings at an earlier "base"date - August 1982 in the case of Mexico. Another streamliningidea is to allow small banks to escape by swapping their loansfor "exit bonds" that a debtor would issue at a discount.    Argentina has pressed for this solution, so far to noavail, arguing that the smallest 120 of its 360 bank creditorsaccount for just one pct of its foreign bank debt and that thenext 120 banks account only for a further six pct.    Central bank president Jose Luis Machinea said Argentinamay not receive the 2.15 billion dlrs in bank loans it isseeking until September, which would be a year afternegotiations began with the International Monetary Fund.    The protracted negotiations have damaged the confidence ofinvestors in Argentina, forcing up interest rates and spurringcapital flight, he said.    "We have to introduce some common sense into thediscussion," Machinea said this week in Cambridge, Mass.    He was echoed by Mexico's deputy planning minister, PedroAspe Armella, who said the delay in signing his country's loanhas made it difficult to map economic policy with anycertainty. "It's a sad affair," he told the Cambridge meeting.    Bankers said Mexico became so frustrated with the delay inthe loan that it suspended its debt-equity swap program lastmonth to put pressure on the banks. Other strains haveintensified between U.S. and non-U.S. banks, partly becauseU.S. regulations and accounting rules discourage writedowns.    Critics say this prompts U.S. banks to focus too much onensuring steady interest payments from debtors in the shortterm, possibly to the detriment of longer-term solutions.    Because more than half of the banks baulking at the Mexicandeal are American, some foreign bankers think other U.S. banksshould make up the difference.    This issue of "national share" was defused on the Mexicancommittee but bankers say it will probably recur in talks withArgentina and Brazil, whose finance minister Dilson Funaro hasalready suggested separate negotiations with regionalcommittees of creditors.    Streamlining of the new-money process is running parallelwith efforts to develop a broader "menu" of alternatives to newloans, such as trade credits or debt-equity conversions.    "We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devisingnew money packages may, in effect, be essential to future banksyndications," Mulford said last week. He told the banks tostop complaining that there is no leeway in current proceduresand to come up with ideas. Some steps have already been taken -interest payments for Chile have been stretched out and banksare debating whether to accept partial interest payments fromthe Philippines in paper instead of cash.    Because the banks want to isolate hard-line Brazil byclinching a deal with Argentina as soon as practicable, bankerssaid the Argentine package is likely to be along theestablished lines of the Baker Plan.    But some bankers are speculating that the Brazilian deal,when it comes, will be radically different.    As such, the loan for Mexico could go down in the historybooks as the biggest but also the last jumbo. "I'm convincedit'll be the last one in this form," one banker said. Reuter&#3;

It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquidreserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimatescaused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year.

Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of itsworldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet lastyear, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased298 billion cubic feet of reserves.    Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of thesegains, the report said.

reut2-007.sgm, SEC OFFICIAL PROPOSES EQUITY, FUTURES TRADE HALT, Securities and commodityexchanges should consider establishing a mechanism for haltingtrading of equities, futures and options when there is unusualprice volatility, a top Securities and exchange, SEC, officialsaid.    Richard Ketchum, director of the SEC's division of marketregulation, said a "short, system-wide halt" of trading ofstocks, futures contracts and options on futures contractswould "let everyone get a breath" in especially volatilemarkets.    Ketchum made his remarks in connection with a FuturesIndustry Association panel discussion on stock index futuresand stock market volatility.    The SEC official did not attempt to define "volatile"markets.    Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman SusanPhillips later told reporters that exchanges already have theauthority to halt trading if an emergency is declared.    But she said Ketchum's proposal was "something to look at"and that she expected the exchanges to explore procedures formaking order imbalances public.    William Brodsky, president of the Chicago MercantileExchange, CME, told Reuters that considering Ketchum's proposalwould be a "worthwhile exercise," but that implementation of atrading halt mechanism posed "major, philosophical, economicquestions."    Ketchum said price limits on contracts "are notparticularly useful in dealing with volatility."

reut2-007.sgm, SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS, Secretary of State George Shultz hasdecided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to theSoviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sellsubsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and theAgriculture Department, a State Department official said.    "Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidylast summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's nowbasically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to whatthey want to do," the official said.    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to theSoviet Union, he said, "Shultz will not wage a vigorouscampaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, buthe won't go to the President and voice his objections."    In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarksyesterday to leaders of the National Association of WheatGrowers, the State Department said, "Secretary Shultz expressedhis belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should becompetitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.    The Agriculture Department is in the best position todetermine whether consideration should be given at this time toextending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export EnhancementProgram."    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to theSoviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer toMoscow, the State Department official said.    "Everyone in the government agrees that if there is asubsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had afirm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy."    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when theUSSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidizedwheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the groundsthat the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bringU.S. prices down to competitive levels.    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, theState Department source said.    "What the Soviets want is something equivalent to thelowest price being paid by anyone in the world," he said.    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of theU.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.    Government and commodity sources also said there areelements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary DanielAmstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.    "Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not aforegone conclusion," the State Department official said. Reuter&#3;

"To think that you can deal with a trade deficit bylegislation is a mistake," he told the Foreign TradeAssociation here.    Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which hewarned of in a letter to House Ways and Means CommitteeChairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on aproduct-for-product basis.    "Retaliation does not have to be matched product toproduct," Denman said.    He said in the case of textiles import restrictions,however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.    "Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on Europeanexports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likelyto retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports toEurope," Denman said.    He also took exception to U.S. proposals to requirecountries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. tocut those surpluses or face special tariffs.    "This would conflict with international obligations, throwa large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations andcould easily boomerang," he warned of the tariff proposals.    Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seekreciprocity in specific trade sectors.    "Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barrierswould simply lead to retaliation from the other party," hesaid, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved bytrading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages inanother.

The proposed accord would initiate the so-called "teamconcept" at the plant, which makes seat cushions and is part ofGM's Inland Division.

An Inland division spokesman would not discuss details ofthe accord. But he said Inland has a "serious" capacityproblem.    No wage or benefit issues are in the proposal.

The charges, made jointly by Sens.

"Serious mistakes were made at every stage of the NewportNews investigation and much time wasted during lengthy periodsof inactivity," the report said.    The Tenneco unit, Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry DockCo, asked the Navy in 1976 for reimbursement of 894 mln dlrs incost overruns in the construction of 14 nuclear-powered ships.The Navy settled the claims for 208 mln dlrs in 1978 and thenrefered the case to the Justice Department for investigation ofpossible fraud.

reut2-007.sgm, IMF OFFICIAL RESIGNS CHARGING U.S. LOAN PRESSURE, One of the top executives of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) has tendered his resignationcharging that the United States has been pressuring the agencyto reduce the conditions it places on some loans, monetarysources said.    C. David Finch, an Australian who heads the IMF's exchangeand trade relations department, told the IMF executive board onWednesday that he planned to leave by the end of next monthafter 37 years with the agency.    The sources said that Finch, in a statement consideredunprecedented, told the board that the United States hadbrought undue pressure on the IMF to approve funding for Zaireand Egypt.    "To resign in this manner is highly unusual, perhapsunprecedented," a monetary source said.    Neither Finch nor U.S. IMF Representative Charles Dallaracould be reached for comment.    The IMF, since the emergence of the debt crisis in 1982,has pressed many countries to tighten their belts and cut backon social spending as conditions to granting assistance.    The United States recently has been taking the positionthat countries that take needed economic reform measuresrelying more on market forces and private enterprise should beencouraged by assistance from the IMF and development banks.    Zaire, under the government of President Mobutu Sese Sekohas recently been taking many reform measures designed to healits ailing economy.    The IMF last year approved a 22-month loan package forZaire totaling 270 mln dlrs.    The United States has been considering the possibility ofseeking access to a military base in Zaire but no decision hasbeen reached.    Egypt, for its part, has been holding talks with the IMFaimed at reaching a final accord on a new one billion dlr loanpackage with the United States pressing for a quick deal,according to the sources.    However, they said a tentative plan for Egypt that iscurrently being reviewed by the management of the Fund prior togoing to the executive board for full approval has raised anumber of questions about the country's ability to repay.    Egypt is also a linchpin in the broad framework of U.S.Middle East policy.    The department headed by Finch, among otherresponsibilties, makes certain that IMF policies and loanconditions are wielded evenly among countries.    Monetary sources have said that the United States hadbrought pressure on the IMF to approve a loan package forMexico using economic conditions that have not been broadlyused before, but Finch, according to the sources, made noreference to this.    Under the debt initiative announced 18 months ago byTreasury Secretary James Baker, the United States made thedecision that debtor countries should be encourged to grow outof their difficulties rather than rely on austerity measures.     He also recommended that commercial banks provide 20billion dlrs in new loans for the debtor countries while themutilateral banks add some six billion dlrs over three years.    A key part of the proposal gave the World Bank a muchgreater role in dealing with the debt crisis, in part becauseof its familiarity with developing countries and theirproblems.    The initiative, while widely heralded as a good first steptoward improving the the growing debt crisis, was viewed bysome at the IMF as a rebuke of previous austerity measuresinsisted upon by the Fund in return for loans.

reut2-007.sgm, FED DATA SUGGEST U.S. CREDIT POLICY IS ON HOLD, Latest Federal Reserve data suggestthat the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going intoa period of traditional tightness and that overall monetarypolicy is on hold, economists said.    "There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shiftgears at the present time or for at least another month," saidMaria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    "Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there isnothing for the (credit) market to get excited about," addedRobert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc.    Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount windowaveraged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bankstatement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mlnand 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods.    Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revisionin banks' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln.    Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14money center banks were absent from the Fed's discount windowfor the third week running, with the latest week's borrowingsplit between the large regional and the smaller banks.    While modest open market intervention was apparently enoughto defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the lateststatement period, economists predicted that the Fed would haveto be more aggressive in coming weeks.    The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectlyon four of the five trading days via system and customerrepurchase agreements.    "Fed funds will be coming under relatively intensepressure," said Salomon's di Clemente, noting the approachingmonth- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax datesin April.    "The Fed is faced with a large seasonal addingrequirement," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc,who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a couponpurchase in early April.    Economists were also heartened by further signs of adeceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largelydiscredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2and M-3 aggregates.    M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine,compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. WeeklyM-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth.    "The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect weare on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figuresfor March," said Salomon's di Clemente. Merrill's McCarthy saidthey could even come in below the bottom of their respectivetarget ranges.    In February, M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upperlimit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath.    Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson's encouraging remarks oninflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, someeconomists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lendsupport to calls for further accommodation here.    "Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards inrates before anything else," said Salomon's di Clemente, addingthat the key swing factor will continue to be the strength ofthe U.S. economy.    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy'shealth would remain the main influence on policy but, contraryto di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth andinflation could lead to higher rates first.    Drexel's Ramirez did not commit herself either way, addingthat the next major move may have to wait until April 14 whenFebruary's U.S. trade data are due for release. Reuter&#3;

But Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffmann said that reports thenaval strike force was in the region did not mean the UnitedStates was sending a new warning to Iran against escalatingattacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf.    "Nothing like that has happened," he said. "No signal is beingsent."    He said that the Kitty Hawk is operating in an area whereit usually does. "It's normal. It's in the waters where it'ssupposed to be. It's been there for over a month."    The Kitty Hawk and its force of warplanes is the mainstayof the U.S. Indian Ocean Battle Group which patrols a vast areaextending from the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea.    With the Kitty Hawk and its group in the Arabian Sea to thesouth and the U.S. Mideast Task Force in the Persian Gulf tothe north, the United States has 10 warships on either end ofthe strategic Straits of Hormuz.    The Pentagon, as is its custom, declined to confirm theexact whereabouts of the ships or what they were up to.    State Department officials cited concern about the safetyof ships passing through the Straits on the vital oil supplyrun to the Gulf.

reut2-007.sgm, DANGER OF ARBITRAGE TRADING DOWNPLAYED, Stock index-related arbitragetrading did not spark the dramatic drop in the U.S. stockmarket last September, nor is a free-fall in stocks and futuresprices due to arbitrage trading a likelihood, a top officialwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, said.    Richard Ketchum, director of SEC's division of marketregulation, told the Futures Industry Association that acommission study of the circumstances surrounding the plunge inthe Dow Jones Industrial Average last September 11-12 showsstock index-related arbitrage trading those days wassubstantial but did not set off the price fluctuations.    "While index-related arbitrage trading was a verysubstantial part of the trading that day, it was by no meansthe predominant part," Ketchum said.    He said the study would be released next week.    Index-related arbitrage relates to efforts, primarily byinstitutional investors, to profit from price differentials byshifting funds between stock index futures and their underlyingstocks.    Some commodity exchange officials fear federal regulatorsor Congress might move to restrict trading of stock indexfutures in an effort to curb stock price volatility.    Ketchum said the slide in stock prices was the result of a"fundamental change in investors' perceptions of economicconditions," triggered by "incorrect rumors" that West Germanywas set to cut its discount rate.    The SEC study indicated the seven firms that accounted formost of the arbitrage trading those days made 127 programtrades on September 11 and 117 trades September 12, accountingfor only 17.5 pct of the "sell side of the New York StockExchange's volume," Ketchum said.    He also said there was virtually no options index-relatedarbitrage activity those days.    Ketchum called "triple witching days" -- the Fridays eachquarter when stock index futures and options and opions onindividual stocks expire simultaneously - a "relatively minor,overdone question" that has "relatively easy solutions."    Moreover, "futures do not appear to have an impact onlong-term or probably even daily volatility," he said.    Finally, Ketchum said a free-fall in stocks and futuresprices driven by program sell-offs of stock index futures andindividual stocks was unlikely.    "We believe that the amount of money now available to comein on the other side of the market by institutions make itunlikely that that kind of snowballing effect would happen," hesaid.    But he said federal regulators could not discard thepossibility and would continue to be concerned by the issue. Reuter&#3;

"No, that is not true," he said before a televised newsconference when asked about reports that he had been told aboutthe money diversion by his former National Security Adviser,John Poindexter.    Reagan was giving his first formal White House pressconference in four months since the Iran arms affair burst intoscandal with the disclosure profits from weapons sales had beendiverted, possibly illegally, to the contras.    He said the secret approach to Iran had resulted in therelease of three American hostages held by pro-Iranian elementsin Lebanon and that it might have freed more if the operationhad not been made public.    Reagan told reporters -- as he had told a presidentialcommission that investigated the scandal -- that he did notremember when he had approved an August, 1985, shipment of U.S.arms to Iran through Israel.    Reagan opened the news conference -- seen as vital inrebuilding his damaged presidency and restoring his authority-- with a statement on the yawning U.S. budget deficit.    He again stated his opposition to tax increases and calledfor a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.

Tonight's news conference was widely seen as an opportunityfor Reagan, 76, to demonstrate he was in command of affairsdespite the crisis.    Reagan said, referring to the Iran arms program, "If Ihadn't thought it was right in the beginning, I never wouldhave started it."    He said he went into the deal because he was persuaded thathe was not dealing directly with the kidnappers.    "You cannot do business with them," he said.    But "suddenly you have a third party there (Iran) ... and itwas not trading with the kidnappers," he said.    The news conference in the White House East Room lasted 32minutes -- two minutes more than normal -- most of which wasdevoted to the Iran affair.    At the last minute, a reporter asked whether Vice PresidentGeorge Bush had opposed the arms sales as Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had done.    Reagan replied, "No," smiled, waved and walked away from thepodium toward the White House residence. Reuter&#3;

Miodrag Lazarevic, president of the Belgrade trade unionscouncil, said the government must take responsibility for theeffects of the law imposing the wage freeze.    Under the law, which was enacted on February 27 and willremain in force until July 1, wage levels of the last quarterof 1986 were reimposed and future pay rises were pegged toproductivity. The move has caused resentment and widespreadindustrial unrest throughout the country.    Another Belgrade trade union council leader, PredragPetrovic, was quoted as saying hundreds of workers had been onstrike in Belgrade.    Yugoslav trade unions are an integral part of the communistpolitical system and their role has traditionally not been todefend workers from the government. The criticisms by theBelgrade union leaders indicated wider trade union resentmentof the law than earlier reported.    The government has officially reported 70 strikesthroughout the country, although Yugoslav newspapers haveindicated there have been more. REUTER&#3;

Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986.

Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coalfrom north to south China and imports include fertiliser andsoda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks canhandle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour.    Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since1979, official publications show.

reut2-007.sgm, SHORT-TERM YEN INTEREST RATES SEEN FALLING SOON, Japanese short-term interest rates,buoyed recently by seasonal factors, are likely to fall fromthe beginning of April when the new financial year begins,money traders said.    The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trendfollowing its attempts to pressure rates to enhance itsdiscount rate cut on February 23, they said.    The Bank cut the rate to 2.5 pct from three, and beganactively injecting funds into the money market to offset raterises resulting from the end-of-fiscal-year surge in demand forfunds from financial institutions.    Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such asaggressive commercial bill purchases, the central bank hasfailed to remove all upward pressure, money traders said.    Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks tocompete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen hasunderpinned short-term rates, they said.    Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yenwere decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September.    This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks risingto 17,830 billion yen by the end-December, a three-foldincrease on end-December 1985 levels, bankers said.    On March 31, the money market expects to see a 2,000billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscalfunds, money traders said.    From April 1, they predict the unconditional call rate willfall to 3.5000 pct from 3.7500 pct today and the one-monthcommercial bill discount rate to drop to 3.7500 pct from 4.0635pct.

reut2-007.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS, Three geographically diverse droughtsin Asia are being linked by some scientists to areintensification of the complex and little-understood El Ninoweather pattern, &lt;Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weatherforecasting service, said.    Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcanegrowers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all faceserious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrivein time to break the droughts, offical reports, governmentofficials and meteorologists said.    Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, saidthe drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinceshave been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.    Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.    Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuanwas 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure forover 20 years, the paper said.    The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pctcompared with last March and lowered the water levels of manyrivers, it added.    This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causingshortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of theYangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing manyships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported acrossChina, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan hasrecorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than averagesince early February.    The New China News Agency said the average Decembertemperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higherthan last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.    Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lankaand threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry ofPlantation Industries officials told Reuters    In Australia, concern is growing about below-averagerainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along theQueensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, localMeteorological Bureau officials said.    For many farmers and government officials the fear is thatwhile the present low rainfall does not yet pose a majorthreat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when thewheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.    Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 droughtwhich devastated the wheat crop and coincided with theoccurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known asEl Nino, they said.    Although meteorologists are cautious about linking theAsia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any singlecause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.    Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data foragriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'was unique.    The El Nino does not always produce the same effects andthe present occurrence is much less pronounced than the lastmajor event in 1982/83, it said.    El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears aroundChristmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing cloudsand rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coastof Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated withthe Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the tradewinds, meteorologists said.    The winds, strengthened by El Nino's "pump" effect, raise thesea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.    When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sendsa surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where itcollides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.    One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect therain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into thePacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.    The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weathersaid.    China, where the affected areas have received between 40and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for theMay-September rains, it said.    The May-September rains normally provide thedrought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.    In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip havereceived less than half the normal rainfall during the currentwet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishingas the rainy season draws to an end.    In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should beat its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usuallyoccur between April and June, although it is not possible atthis stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual. REUTER&#3;

"I don't think it's going to undermine public confidence inthe banking system from Brazil alone," he said. "But I would liketo see further progress made on this whole situation."    Brazil announced last month it was temporarily suspendinginterest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt owed to privatebanks, opening a new round in the five-year-old debt crisis.    Last week, Ecuador suspended interest payments to privateforeign banks, which hold about two-thirds of its total 8.3billion dlr foreign debt, citing severe damage to its oilindustry caused by an earthquake.

The government has said it will ask for another 500 mln dlrlong-term loan from a World Bank-led consultative group ofmultilateral and bilateral aid donors to partially fund itsland reform program.    The officials said negotiations will start next month onanother 150 mln dlr loan sought by Manila to carry out reformsin 14 major state-owned corporations.    On Tuesday, the world bank approved two loans totalling 310mln dlrs to help the country's economic recovery program.    The bank was also studying Philippine proposals for loansto finance geothermal and education projects, sources said.    World Bank sources said the bank's lending to thePhilippines since 1957, including the latest loan, totalled 4.3billion dlrs. The money has been spread out over more than 100loans and about 1.2 billion dlrs remains undisbursed.    The World Bank sources said the bank cancelled 450 mln dlrsin loan commitments to the Philippines during the last threeyears of President Ferdinand Marcos's rule. Marcos was toppledby a military-civilian revolt in February 1986.    "The loans were cancelled because the projects slated foraid were not implemented properly," they said.    The sources said the bulk of this week's loan would be usedto rehabilitate the state-owned Development Bank of thePhilippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB) whichare saddled with seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.    "At least 300 mln dlrs of previously cancelled loans weresupposed to go to the DBP," the World Bank sources said. "Overthe past three years the bank's disbursement pipeline to thePhilippines almost completely dried up."    In 1986 alone, the two banks paid out 16 billion pesos inloan repayments, about 59 pct of the government's budgetdeficit of 27 billion pesos for the year, they said.    Agreement on the latest loan was reached in principle lastSeptember when President Corazon Aquino visited the U.S. Thesources said the loan was held up because of delays by thegovernment in submitting essential documents.    The World Bank sources said the request for land reformfunding would be discussed at a meeting of the World Bank-ledconsultative group to be held alongside the April 27-29 annualmeeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Osaka.    The government has said the land reform plan aims todistribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished peasants.    The sources said the Philippine government estimated theentire program would cost 60 billion pesos. "About 27 billion islong-term and will cover land transfer costs borne mainly bylandowners," they said. "The landowners will be paid in 10-yearbonds redeemable in ten instalments."    The sources said the bulk of financing would coverdevelopment costs for the land program and help to bridge thegap between the 10-year spread of payments to landowners and aproposed 30-year loan repayment period for land buyers.    "If you include interest, the total amount of externalassistance needed annually should not exceed 200 mln dlrs," thesources said. "That volume of aid does not appear difficult."    They said Japan, the World Bank and the ADB are expected toprovide most of the financing while the Philippines' 12bilateral aid donors would contribute the rest.    The World Bank sources said lending to the Philippines isdesigned to support its balance of payments position while thegovernment aims for a target of six to seven pct annual grossnational product growth.    "Brazil did not do this homework," one said. "They pushedahead with a recovery program without ensuring backing fortheir balance of payments position. Manila is being morecautious and aims at soft borrowings which, it is hoped, willbe outstripped by annual growth rates and eventually result inthe country emerging from debt in five or six years."    Philippine foreign debt is currently 27.8 billion dlrs. REUTER&#3;

SAS signed a letter of intent for the MD-11s last December,but a company statement said the decision on whether to hardenthis up into a firm order would be linked to the outcome ofnegotiations with the United States on deregulating air faresacross the North Atlantic.    The SAS move, said by analysts to be a big blow toMcDonnell Douglas, came following a Copenhagen board meeting ofthe airline in which the governments of Sweden, Denmark andNorway jointly own a 50 pct stake. The remainder is held byindustry.    A company statement said SAS would wait to see the outcomeof the government-to-government negotiations with the UnitedStates, in which the three Scandinavian countries have demandedgreater access to the U.S. Domestic market for SAS in exchangefor deregulating prices across the North Atlantic.    At present SAS is allowed to fly to New York, Chicago, LosAngeles, Seattle and Anchorage.    SAS gave no details of the Airbus Industrie counter-offerfor its long-range A340, but said it will study the bidfurther.    Swissair yesterday confirmed an order for the MD-11 longhaul jets worth 1.2 billion Swiss francs and said it hadpreferred the McDonnell Douglas planes over the A340, a projectthat has not yet been formally launched, as it met theairline's requirements better and would be able to enterservice in 1990.    SAS President Jan Carlzon announced the MD-11 order lastDecember, saying the plane would replace the airline's currentfleet of DC10s. The first of the MD-11s was to be delivered in1991 for use mainly on its intercontinental routes.    In January, SAS officials said Airbus had made a revisedoffer that included larger, more powerful engines and twoversions of the four-engine plane. One would seat 220passengers and another 260 against the MD-11's 265-seatcapacity.    The offer was part of a drive to secure at least fiveairline customers for the new aircraft to enable AirbusIndustrie to launch production. Airbus is expected to decidewhether to go ahead with the project next month.    SAS officials earlier said they did not expect the firstA340 to be delivered before 1992. McDonnell Douglas had givenSAS until March 31 to agree to final terms for the MD-11 deal. REUTER&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS, The death of the world's tropical rainforests could trigger a new debt crisis and social andbiological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved withthe International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said.    At stake is the ability of developing nations, includingBrazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts andthe loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars inimportant sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, theysaid.    The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting ofconsumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problemis already acute.    The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economicdangers. "For many third world nations, the loss of the forestis not just a loss of resources," said Delfin Ganapin, aPhilippine government consultant on environmental impact.    "In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest,now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitablelogging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of loggingforeign exchange earnings is serious," he said.    About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas thatare now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops.    Government security advisers say that as a direct result,the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is inthe upland areas, said Ganapin.    Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoodshave less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no knownway to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within.    "No replanting programme has been successful," said AlmyHafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation.    Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the nexttwo years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denudedland in the Philippines.    The experts say that without a major initiative from thedevelopment banks, the vicious circle will continue withcountries cutting more forest to help service short-term debtsat the cost of long-term insolvency.    Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is notnecessarily the most direct economic product of the forests,and nations must be educated in how best to "farm" them, saidPeter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director.    There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the endproducts of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs ayear, he said.    U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredientsto higher plants growing in the forests.    Deforestation would wipe out the chance of furtherdiscoveries and force major corporations to research, developand produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientistssay is incalculable.    By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still beexporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earningswill drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than twobillion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said.    Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank,Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84,only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said.    WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forestshave vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining,up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive loggingpractises and by local farmers. REUTER&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, BRAZIL SEEN AS VANGUARD FOR CHANGING DEBT STRATEGY, Brazil's hard-line debt stance, thoughmeeting creditor resistance, is boosting political initiativesin Latin America aimed at broadening the global strategy,regional debt officials and economic analysts say.    "Now more than ever it is clear that Latin America cannotpay, under present conditions, without sacrificing growth,"Peruvian President Alan Garcia said, referring to Brazil.    And, as debtors and creditors prepare for their annualmeeting at the Inter-American Development Bank in Miami nextweek, the region's debt crisis is clearly coming to a head.    Around 200 billion dlrs in commercial bank debt have beenrescheduled since 1983, with interest rate margins now belowone pct, multi-year accords a norm and no financial crash insight, but a lasting solution seems no nearer.    Virtually all Latin American leaders backed Brazil'ssuspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of privatebank debt last month, though prospects of a chain default arestill remote.    Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and others rejected such actionand Mexican finance minister Gustavo Petricioli merely said,"Brazil is having problems we are sure will be temporary."    But Brazil's action has had an impact on other debtnegotiations, speeding agreement for Chile and Venezuela lastmonth and influencing current talks with Argentina.    Pressure for new solutions has built up on several fronts,with the Philippines joining Brazil in seeking interest reliefand Ecuador announcing force majeure on debt payments followinga serious earthquake.    Private banks are being increasingly urged to renew lendingand accept innovative repayment schemes, not only by debtorsbut also by official agencies which have stepped up their owncredit flows as part of the U.S.-inspired plan.    One Latin American debt official said he saw the Brazil andEcuadorean announcements as spurring moves by other debtors tolink debt service payments to macroeconomic indicators such asexport earnings, GDP or raw materials prices.    Despite this, debtor countries continue to accept thecase-by-case approach, and Cuba's call for a joint negotiatingfront is not being promoted by Brazil or even defended by Peru,the region's flag-bearer in unilateral payment decisions.    "Each nation must negotiate its debt independently,according to its own needs," Brazilian foreign minister Ramirode Abreu Sodre said in Caracas at the weekend.    Venezuela's rapid agreement with its creditors, soon afterBrazil's move, had been seen by the political opposition as abetrayal of debtor solidarity, but de Abreu praised theVenezuelan negotiators for achieving a favourable deal.    Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica and others are also pursuingnormal negotiations with creditor banks, while at the same timepressing hard for better terms, particularly lower interestrate spreads. Latin American officials say that while the debtshould be negotiated case-by-case, their governments arepromoting a general framework for talks based on growth anddevelopment priorities, lower interest payments and newfinancing.    "The Brazilian and Ecuadorean experience shows orthodoxsolutions to debt cases don't work," said a senior Peruviangovernment official responsible for debt affairs.    He saw a growing likelihood that other countries wouldfollow Peru's action in setting a 10 pct debt payment limit inthe face of trade and other factors beyond debtors' controlsuch as minimal bank lending.    These factors have contributed to a 130 billion dlr netoutflow from Latin America in the last five years, andBrazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro says Brazil alone paidback 45 billion dlrs in this time and received just 11 billionin loans.    Latin American debtors feel they have complied with theirside of the bargain, slashing public spending, devaluingcurrencies, cutting inflation, privatizing state enterprisesand introducing debt equity schemes.    Brazil, as the region's biggest debtor and its mostdiversified economy, has now apparently adopted the principlethat a tough position with its creditors will avoid a moreserious crisis later on.    "We are negotiating so that the debt question should not beone of continuous crisis," Funaro told a conference in Rio deJaneiro this week.billion dlr debt burden this year are slim, with coffee pricesplunging, oil prices up but still well below 1985 levels andinterest rates beginning to rise. Mexico expects one to two pct growth instead of the two tothree pct projected earlier, and inflation near 80 pct after105 pct last year.    Brazilian officials expect growth of only two pct aftereight pct last year and a 30 pct drop in the projected tradesurplus, while independent estimates put inflation at 200 pct.    Political and economic analysts in Brazil believe thepayment suspension will give new impetus to tackling theregional crisis though they expect protracted negotiations, aview echoed by senior international bank officials.    Some banks, including Citibank, Morgan Guaranty and Bank ofAmerica are already preparing to downgrade their Brazil loans.    Brazil's refusal to accept an IMF program, a condition setby many banks for new lending, meanwhile reflects the view ofmost Latin American governments that equate the Fund withrecession. But Brazil and Venezuela are the only countries inthe region to have rescheduled debt without an IMF program. REUTER&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, SWISS BANKER WANTS BOND RATINGS, SHARE DISCLOSURE, A top Swiss banker called for anobligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds andsaid he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a companyshould be made to declare their share.    In comments at a news conference of &lt;Vontobel Holding AG>,chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks'own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board,to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.    A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swissfranc market and a debate on the use of registered shares toprevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.    Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to themarket with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which werereadily available to professionals through specialisedinformation systems.    "We should make this classification obligatory and publishit in places that are easily accessible to lay people," he said.The quick changing nature of the financial market meant theseratings should also be continually updated, he said.    Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies,worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered sharesand participation certificates rather than bearer shares.    However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. Therecent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> to take over HeroConserven Lenzburg &lt;HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someonewho was not eligible according to the company's statutes.    Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do notcarry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle ofgreater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.

reut2-007.sgm, U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - BUDGET DEFICIT, Economists' forecasts vary widely forthe February monthly U.S. budget deficit to be released today.However most agree on one point -- that the budget deficit forthe 1987 fiscal year will narrow substantially from 1986levels.    The report is likely to mean very little to the moribundcredit markets, however, which have been stilled by a stabledollar and perceptions of steady Federal Reserve policy.    Economists said that a leaner federal budget could help thecredit markets if it lowers the Treasury's financing needs andresults in lower interest rates, but investors may not responduntil they see evidence that this is taking place.    Economists' forecasts for the February deficit range from20 billion dlrs to nearly 30 billion dlrs, with most forecastsclustered in the 26-28 billion dlrs range. This compares with adeficit of 24.6 billion dlrs in February 1986.    In January, the budget deficit was 2.1 billion dlrs,leaving the fiscal year-to-date deficit at 65.6 billion dlrs.    Most economists expect the 1987 fiscal deficit to fall to180-190 billion dlrs from 220.7 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986.    Kathleen Stephansen of Donaldson, Lufkin and JenretteSecurities Corp, expects a 26.3 billion dlr February budgetdeficit, and a 186.5 billion dlr fiscal 1987 deficit.    Stephansen expects widening in the February deficitrelative to last year based on two developments.    First, total revenues showed a slowdown in their yearlygrowth rate relative to prior months' growth rates, she said,as corporate and individual tax payments net of tax refundpayments appear to have been weak in February.    "The second factor... is relatively strong outlayperformance," Stephansen wrote in a weekly report. "Dataavailable to date suggest that their year-over-year growth isclose to 4.3 pct, well above the 0.5 pct average that prevailedin the last four months of the fiscal year."    Joe Liro of S.G. Warburg Securities and Co expects theFebruary budget deficit to total 26-28 billion dlrs and thefiscal 1987 deficit to be 190 billion dlrs.    He said that as a result of the change in the 1987 tax codeand the new structure for determining withholding of personalincome tax payments, the Treasury is receiving less taxreceipts than it received at this time last year.    "The Administration compounded a tricky situation by sayinghow difficult it is to fill out the new W-4 tax forms he said."The wage earner was underwithholding at the beginning of theyear and continues to be underwithheld."    By contrast, Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch GovernmentSecurities Inc said that many taxpayers have probably delayedfilling out the new tax withholding forms, so that this has notbeen a drag on tax receipts as others have argued.    "The first half of the year brought strong tax receiptsfrom capital gains and the repeal of the investment tax credit,which is expected to contribute a substantial portion of thecorporate taxes to be paid this week," he said in the firm'sweekly credit market memo.    He forecast a February budget deficit of 20 billion dlrs,and a fiscal 1987 deficit of 180 billion dlrs.    In March, McCarthy expects to see a deficit of 23 to 24billion dlrs compared with 30 billion dlrs in March 1986.    But economists agreed that the federal budget deficit isfar from occupying center stage in the credit market's focusand is unlikely to have an impact now regardless of its size.    Yesterday, the key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 closedunchanged at 99-28/32 to yield 7.51 pct after trading in anarrow range throughout the session.

As expected, the president repeatedly stated -- now calmly,now with some fire -- that he knew nothing about thatscheme, said to have been run by White House National Securityaide Oliver North, since fired, with the knowledge ofpresidential adviser John Poindexter, now resigned.    "No, that is not true at all," the president replied sternlywhen asked about a report Poindexter had told him, twice, aboutthe secret channeling of millions of dollars to the contras.    "When I went on the air right after the news broke (aboutIran arms deal last November), I did not know at that timethere was any money involved."    He said he learned of the contra diversion -- which mayhave broken U.S. laws and will be the top priority ofcongressional investigative hearings on this affair -- onlywhen Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese told him on November 25.    Just as important from Reagan's standpoint, however, wasthe manner in which he handled his first non-scripted publicaccounting of the scandal since the details first began leakingout last November and plunged his administration into deeppolitical crisis.    He appeared to bring it off without major stumbles, abettedby a press corps that seemed at pains to maintain a civilmanner until the very end when it crowded round him trying toget in one last question as he was leaving the rostrum in theWhite House East Room.    He often responded slowly and deliberately but never seemedat a loss for words, or vintage Reagan mannerisms.    At one point in the contra discussion he furrowed his browin puzzlement as he said he was just as mystified as everyoneabout where all the unaccounted millions had gone from the Iranarms sales of 1985 and 1986.    "I'm still wanting to find out the source of all the extramoney, the bank accounts and where that extra money went," hesaid.    At another point, he laughed off a question on whether hemight have been told about the contra connection and forgotten,saying, "Oh, no," pausing to chuckle and adding:    "You'd have heard me without opening the door to my officeif I'd been told that."

reut2-007.sgm, JAPAN UNDER ATTACK OVER TRADE SURPLUS, Japan's economic policies face fierceinternational attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in itstrade surplus, international monetary sources said.    At a meeting this week in Paris, senior governmentofficials from major nations are considering an Organisationfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff reportthat forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus, theysaid.    Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with theyen's sharp rise against the dollar, they still tend to surgewhen growth picks up, according to the OECD.    As a solution, the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirectits export-driven economy, boosting domestic demand and importsby adopting a more flexible fiscal policy, they said.    That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secretmeetings of the International Monetary Fund's executive board.    The monetary sources said Japan's policy was criticizedwhen the board met to consider the country's economy under theannual consultations it holds with each of its members.    The United States, which until recently has been reluctantto criticize Japan's fiscal stance, joined in the attack, hesaid.    The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanesegovernment's forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscalyear beginning April 1. Most independent forecasters, includingthe IMF, believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be belowthree pct, monetary sources said.    The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive tosuch criticism because it is already under mounting domesticpressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen's rise. Theyen's climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the hugeAmerican market.    Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a furtheryen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus, which lastyear amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs.    Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen, ForeignMinister Tadashi Kuranari said recently. The yen closed heretoday at 151.53 to the dollar. Most Japanese politicians,including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, are clearly hopingthe yen will weaken, government officials said.    At a meeting in Paris last month, Britain, Canada, France,Japan, the United States and West Germany, agreed to cooperateto hold currencies at around current levels.    Officials said that wording represented a compromise.Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a fewmonths, before it weakens later in the year.    Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher valuefor the dollar, perhaps by substituting the word "recent" for"current," while the United States wanted it to more clearlypoint to the dollar's weaker levels now, perhaps by use of theword "present," they said.    In the months leading up the February 22 agreement, thedollar dropped some 10 yen.    The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in themarket that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar fromrising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling forthe U.S. Currency.    Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts, which it says donot take account of the structural changes in the Japaneseeconomy that will be triggered by the strong yen.    Officials said there are already signs of that. More andmore companies have announced plans to move productionfacilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad,they said. REUTER&#3;

The company said the study found proven ore reserves of3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton.  Itsaid the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore peryear, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first threeyears for a rapid payback of capital costs.    The company said the feasibility study calls for goldproduction averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of themine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miunelife.    Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipmentand 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but theassociated mill by Geodome.    Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is notincluded in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nineholes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce ofgold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton.

The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 asthe government has decided to compile a 50-day stop-gap budgetfor the year starting April 1. An opposition boycott over aproposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business.    Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington.    Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April orearly May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June.    Asked if he planned to visit the U.S. To attend monetaryconferences including International Monetary Fund meetings inearly April, Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully onthe matter, taking into account parliament debate.

The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far,and they said Japan would comment on the final results.    A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the studyhas found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies inthe world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any othercommodity producers from subsidies. The study has not beenofficially released due to objections from some countries.    Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept therelease of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said.OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meetingin mid-May.    One agriculture ministry source said the study so far wasbased on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have droppedsharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy,and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.    "The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it doesnot take account of various differences in farming conditionsin each country, such as geography," the source said.    He said it is highly likely that the final study will showJapan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.    "This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farmmarket further, but this would have little impact on Japan'sagriculture policy," he said, without giving further details.    A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidiesby major exporting nations like the United States and theEuropean Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said. Reuter&#3;

Zdzislaw Kuroski, deputy director of Comecon, who heads theEast bloc delegation, told Reuters ahead of today's session: "Wehave narrowed our differences on a range of questions, but noton all questions."    Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that anyjoint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of theCommunity, he replied: "This question is not contained in thedraft which our side presented."    West German diplomats said they would insist on includingthe clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement.    The talks followed an earlier round between the two tradingblocs here last September and the first-ever direct talksbetween the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomaticrelations in January.    The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despitenon-recognition of Comecon. Last year, the EC had a fivebillion dlr trade deficit with East European states, about halfthe deficit of the previous year, due to a drop in the price ofSoviet oil imported by the EC. REUTER&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, MORGAN GUARANTY SELLS FIRST REPACKAGED PERPETUAL, Morgan Guaranty Ltd, through a specialfinancing subsidiary, said it is issuing the first repackagingof perpetual floating rate notes, consisting of a repackagingof an outstanding WestPac Banking Corp security.    Trading in perpetual floating rate notes, about 17 billiondlrs of which are outstanding, has come to a virtual halt asprices plunged. Because the securities never mature, there isno way to price them properly unless there is a liquid two-waymarket for them.    Investors have been stuck with billions of dollars of noteson their books that no one else will buy.    Under terms of the offer, Morgan said it has set up aspecial-purpose financing company, Pacific Securities Co Ltd,which will issue two separate securities. The unit becomes theholder of 200 mln dlrs of Westpac floating rate notes.    Morgan officials declined to disclose the level at whichPacific  purchased the Westpac securities, although in lateFebruary, they were quoted at 85 against an issue price of par.    Pacific Securities will issue two instruments. The first isa floating rate bond due March 29, 2002. The bond pays interestat 50 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate.    While the initial Westpac issue offered investors only 15basis points over LIBOR, Morgan Guaranty said WestPac hasagreed with Pacific Securities that it will pay investors theremaining 35 basis points.    Also, WestPac has agreed to redeem to floating rate notesafter 15 years.    The other portion of the security consists of a zero-couponbond, also maturing at 2002, for which the investor pays 20cents on the dollar. Morgan officials said that by 2002, theeffective yield will be a 20 pct return.    However, Morgan officials said, holders of the zero-couponbonds will not be paid in cash when the securities mature.    Instead, they will be paid in an equivalent amount ofzero-coupon Westpac perpetual floating rate notes.    As part of the agreement, Pacific Securities has agreed toplace proceeds of the sale of the new securities on deposit atWestPac and earnings from the deposit will be used to subsidisethe payment of the additional interest to investors.    Also as part of the issue, there is an option for issuanceof a 70 mln dlr tap to be offered the following year.    The tap will consist of 70 mln dlrs in floating rate notespaying and an additional equivalent amount of zero coupon bondsalso at a deep discount of 20 cents on the dollar.    Fees consist of a one pct selling concession and 0.50 pctcombined underwriting and management.    Westpac itself has agreed to be co-lead manager of bothtranches and two small syndicates are being formed, MorganGuaranty said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, BANK OF FINLAND TO TRADE IN BANKS' CERTIFICATES, The Bank of Finland said it hasstarted dealings in banks' certificates of deposits (CDs) withimmediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its ownpaper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market.    Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a newsconference the Bank will also limit credits on the call moneymarket from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum creditamount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling.    "The recent introduction of three-month money and these newregulations are decreasing the role of the call money marketand the discount rate as monetary instruments," Kullberg said.    Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying thesewere needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bankof Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs,they said.    "The central bank for the first time has an instrument withwhich it really can influence the price of money in thiscountry," one banker said.    Under the new rules banks are limited to call money creditsto a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capitaland cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is nowintroduced if the limit is exceeded.    Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetarydepartment said he expected the bank to pursue an active policyon the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs.    "We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue thefirst, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think wewill issue at least a few times a week," Korkman told Reuters.    He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with athree-month maturity at first as the market was best developedfor paper of that maturity.    The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-monthcredits and deposits at rates determined by the central bankand the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditionalovernight call money market.    Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from aroundnine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week,while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion.    On the interbank market there has been an increasing tradein banks' CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka.

Melamed, also the head of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, tolda press conference yesterday at the Futures IndustryAssociation convention that within the next year or two theJapanese government is "going to lift the curtain on theircommunity of users" of futures markets.    Currently, government restrictions prevent Japanesecitizens from trading futures or options contracts off-shoreand converting the profits back into yen, according to RichardHeckinger, CME's vice president for international marketing.    In addition, Japanese are not allowed to convert yen intodollars for the purpose of trading futures contracts overseas,he said.    Melamed predicted the Nikkei stock average index future --a price-weighted index future based on 225 Tokyo Stock Exchangeissues which is traded on the Singapore International MonetaryExchange and mutually offset at the CME -- would do much betterif Japanese financial institutions were able to use it.    CME is waiting for approval from the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission to begin trading the Nikkei stock indexfuture in Chicago.    "We will not do as well with that contract until or unlessthe Japanese community, financial institutions, can utilize itin Chicago," Melamed said.    Melamed and Heckinger said they had no firm evidence thatTokyo would liberalize futures trading rules, but sensed fromJapanese inquiries and visits a readiness to change.    Next month, the CME is to open a Tokyo office to strengthenthe exchange's link to Japan.    The managing director of the office will be Takeo Arakawa,formerly of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Tokyo.    Melamed said he hoped Arakawa would help the CME maintain acompetitive edge when Japan launches financial futures trading.    Next month the Osaka exchange is set to begin trading astock index future, Heckinger said.    "We are not going to let them (the Japanese) do what theydid to the American automobile industry.

reut2-007.sgm, MEXICO SIGNS 7.7 BILLION DLR LOAN AGREEMENT, Mexican officials and representativesof about 360 creditor banks worldwide started to signagreements for 7.7 billion dlrs in new loans, Citibank said asco-chairman of Mexico's bank advisory committee.    The package, which was agreed in principle with thecommittee last October 16, is built on a core loan of sixbillion dlrs, of which five billion dlrs will be lent for 12years with five years' grace.    The remaining one billion dlrs is in the form of aco-financing with the World Bank, which will guarantee 500 mlndlrs. This loan is for 15 years with nine years' grace.    The package also includes two contingency facilitiestotalling 1.7 billion dlrs.    One is a growth-contingency co-financing with the WorldBank for 500 mln dlrs, of which half will be guaranteed by theWorld Bank.    The loan may be drawn to fund high-priority investmentprojects if Mexican economic growth fails to reach certaingrowth targets for the first quarter of 1987.    Disbursements would be for 12 years with seven years'grace. Bankers said they expect the loan, which is availableuntil March 1988, will be drawn down.        The second contingency facility, for 1.2 billion dlrs, isdesigned to support investment in the public and privatesectors.    The loan may be drawn down until April 1988 but only ifMexico experiences a shortfall in public-sector externalreceipts and provided that Mexico first qualifies for drawingsunder a 600 mln sdr oil-contigency facility from theInternational Monetary Fund.    This IMF loan would be triggered if the price of oil fallsbelow nine dlrs a barrel for three months.    Because of the level of public sector external receipts inthe fourth quarter of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987,Mexico will not draw the first two tranches of the continencyfacility, totalling 451 mln dlrs, Citibank said.    As previously reported, bank commitments to the new moneypackage will also be reduced by 250 mln dlrs, representing theinterest payments that Mexico will save this year, thanks tothe reduced spread on the rescheduling.    Under the rescheduling, Mexico is restructuring 43.7billion dlrs of previously rescheduled debt over 20 years withseven years' grace.    Maturities on another 8.6 billion dlrs of loans granted in1983 and 1984 will remain the same. The interest rate will beat 13/16 pct over Eurodollar deposit rates - the margin thatapplies to the entire package.    Rounding out the deal, the banks have agreed to prolong sixbillion dlrs of trade lines and to refinance some 10 billiondlrs of private-sector debt that comes under the Mexicangovernment's exchange-guarantee scheme, Ficorca.    The size of the package thus comes to about 76 billiondlrs, the largest ever assembled in the international creditmarkets, Citibank said.    The loan is still only 99 pct subscribed and the loan bookswill be kept open for several more weeks to round up the final100 mln dlrs and the approximately 60 banks that have so farrefused to join the deal.

reut2-007.sgm, ITALY SETS RULES FOR COMPANY HOLDINGS IN BANKS, Companies will henceforth be able to ownstakes in banks, but these should not constitute a "dominant"holding, an Italian government committee ruled.    The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings,headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decisionreflected the "need to safeguard the principle of separationbetween banks and non-financial concerns."    It did not quantify what might constitute a "dominant"holding.    The committee also set conditions for the allocation ofcredits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes inthem, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italycould exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes heldby banks in companies or other banks.    Under the ruling, credits given by banks or theirsubsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or moreof the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits.    The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifthof the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself ortwo-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by thegroup or individual concerned.    Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concernsin which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreignbanks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks tosubsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also beexcluded from the conditions.    The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules intheir statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holdingfive pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privilegedtreatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.    With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank ofItaly can exercise supervisory controls when information on abank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in acompany or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly orindirectly.    Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake heldis below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.    The controls will not be exercised in cases where the valueof the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of twopredefined limits.    These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of thetotal assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank. REUTER&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, TALKING POINT/FIRST CITY BANCORPORATION &lt;FBT>, First City Bancorporation's sale of 54mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantlyreduce its energy problems, but the bank's losses are stillvirtually guaranteed to continue, analysts said.    The package of energy loans was sold at book value, soFirst City did not to show a gain or loss, said bank spokesmanJames Day. He added it was possible First City would sell moreof the bank's remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loansto raise cash.    The loans had been made by First City to oil producers andto oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some hadalready been classified as nonperforming, or charged off as aloss, but he could not identify how many were included in thosecategories.    The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache's EnergyGrowth Fund, a limited partnership created last month with 90mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties.    First City, the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturnin oil prices, lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some othercapital assistance. The Houston-based bank's nonperformingassets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend, up from 563.1 mlndlrs at the end of 1985    Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested inthe troubled bank unless government assistance is available.    "Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have asubstantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and ofitself won't make the company look better to a potentialbuyer," said Ray Archibold, a banking analyst with McCarthy,Crisanti and Maffei Inc.    "It does reduce the bank's exposure in energy loans and 54mln dlrs is a substantial amount," Archibold said, "but thedeal represents only about four pct of their energy loans."    Of First City's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers orsuppliers, analysts said. Its record losses have been caused byits past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil andgas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late1970s and early 1980s.    First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudentialcame from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 toloan money to "more venturesome" oil borrowers that promised ahigher potential return. The other half of the loans were fromFirst City's lead bank in Houston.    Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., saidthe sale of the package of energy loans was the firstencouraging news from First City in months.    "It's not going to solve all of First City's problems butit's a good transaction for them. It may be possible for themto sell additional loans," Kotowski said. "Prudential can fundthese things more cheaply than First City and there's anincentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now asvalues are depressed"    In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said thebank's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans tototal loans. "This move, which we believe is the firsttransaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able tomake it without suffering a loss." Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, FDA OKAYS BURROUGHS WELLCOME AZT AS AIDS TREATMENT, The Food and Drug Administration hasapproved Burroughs Wellcome Co's AZT as a treatment to helpcertain AIDS patients, including those with advanced-AIDSrelated complex.    The drug is the first approved treatment for AIDS in theU.S. AZT or azidothymidine will be marketed as Retrovir by thecompany, the U.S. arm of Britain's &lt;Wellcome PLC>.    Because of its limited supply, the FDA said the drug willbe restricted initially to those patients with AIDS orAIDS-related complex with severely depressed immunity or ahistory of Pnumocystis carinii, pneumonia.    "Today's approval marks an important step but by no means afinal victory against our ongoing war against AIDS," said DrRobert E. Windom, assistant secretary for health at the PublicHealth Service.    He noted that available clinical data were sufficient forapproving the use of Retrovir only for certain indications andnot for all AIDS associated conditions.    Nevertheless, Windom said today's action means thatsignificant medical relief will be available to thousands ofthose afflicted with the disease.    "Retrovir is not a cure but it has demonstrated ability toimprove the short-term survival of AIDS patients with recentlydiagnosed PCP (Pneumomystis carinii pneumonia) and certainpatients with advanced ARC (AIDS-related complex)," saidWindom.    Advanced AIDS related complex is a condition thatfrequently precedes and develops within a short time intofull-scale acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    As of March 16, there were 32,825 AIDS cases reportednationwide, with more than 16,000 deaths.    The Public Health Agency said advanced ARC patients havesymptoms that include weight loss, persistent fever anddiarrhea, and less severe infections such as oral thrush andherpes infections.    The federal agency said that AIDS patients who are expectedto qualify for retrovir treatment are those who have seriousopportunistic infections associated with AIDS and those withadvanced AIDS related complex.    It is estimated that about two to three times as manyAmericans may suffer from advanced ARC as from AIDS.    Burroughs Wellcome, of Research Triangle Park, N.C., hasscheduled a press conference for Monday in New York where itwill discuss what patients will quality for treatment. Thecompany has said that a year's treatment with the drug wouldcost 8,000 dlrs to 10,000 dlrs.    Burroughs has also said that it has adequate supplies ofthe drug for the most seriously ill patients, and will havesupplies for a minimum of 30,000 patients and probably more bythe end of the year.    Retrovir's approval was expected as a panel of expertmedical advisers to the FDA recommended in January that thedrug be licensed for sale even though there were gaps inunderstanding the drug's effectiveness.    The panel said the drug could prolong the lives of certainAIDS patients but it also caused severe side effects such asanemia and other blood problems.    Due to the extraordinary situation surrounding AIDS, afatal disease reaching what some health officials say isepidemic proportions, Windom said the FDA has moved in nearrecord time--four months--to approve the drug.    AZT, derived from herring sperm, was created in the 1960sby Jerome P. Horwitz of the Michigan Cancer Foundation as ananticancer agent.    Meanwhile in London, dealers said Wellcome shares rose to497p in response, up from last night's close of 457p.    But pharmaceutical analyst Mark Clark of Barclays de ZoeteWedd said the new drug's share of the market may not be as ahigh as expected since it had very severe side effects.    "It is not a cure and the side effects are so bad it isunlikely that someone could support a full year's treatment," hesaid. "There are also a whole host of other drugs likely to comeonto the market quite soon."    Last week the drug was approved for marketing in the U.K. Reuter&#3;

Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one ofthe two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its shareto three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategyJonathan Solomon told reporters.    That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerfulbusiness organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of thePost and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm ofprotest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreignfirms from a meaningful position in the market.    Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N> of the United States alsoholds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia,&lt;International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC).    Solomon said that both British Prime Minister MargaretThatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz havewritten to the Japanese government about the planned merger.    A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary MalcolmBaldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have alsoexpressed opposition to the merger, he said.    The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated againthat it sees no need for two competitors to &lt;Kokusai DenshinDenwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international callsfrom Japan.

reut2-007.sgm, GERMAN MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH SLOWS IN FEBRUARY, West Germany's money supply growthslowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend isstill definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.    Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was onlymoderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits withstatutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply,short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusuallystrongly in January.    In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdingsof German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjustedannual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.    Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct.    In the six months to February, M2, which excludes timedeposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cashand sight deposits, rose seven pct.    International transactions of non-banks again led to asignificant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.    Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank againstforeigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise.    But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of theinflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionaryeffect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.    Outstanding bank credits to companies and privateindividuals remained virtually unchanged in February.    A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflectedthe foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise inlong-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.    At the end of February total bank credits to the privatesector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level.    The effect of public authority cash movements on the moneysupply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.    Although banks acquired large amounts of public authoritypaper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercialbanks and the Bundesbank.

reut2-007.sgm,  EC SAYS U.S. BROKE TRADE RULES IN AKZO-DUPONT ROW, The European Community Commission hascharged the United States with breaking international traderules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market andsaid it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT.    In the latest of a series of trade disputes withWashington, the executive authority alleged that a section ofthe U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminatedagainst imported products in favour of domestically-producedgoods.    The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to ruleon whether the section in question, which officials said hadproved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules.    Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measuresif, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed tobring the disputed section into line with international rules.    The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaintto it by the Dutch company Akzo &lt;AKZO.AS>, whose "aramid"synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market becauseof charges by the U.S. Firm &lt;Dupont> that the fibres violatethe American company's patents.    Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S.International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory andincompatible with GATT provisions.    The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of theU.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over importedproducts. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did nothave the same possibilities for defending themselves before theITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.    "Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourablethan that which takes places in normal courts of law for goodsproduced in the United States," it said in a statement. Reuter&#3;

U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this weekUSDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium atthe Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS postedprices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement.    But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes.    "If people are suggesting that we are going to makewholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this," hesaid.    Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity ofimplementing more minor changes in its pricing system.    "We are continually monitoring the whole nationwidestructure to maintain its accuracy," he said. "If we becomeconvinced that we need to make a change, then appropriateadjustments will be made."    Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA'sprice differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interiormarkets are not accurate because of higher than normal bargefreight rates.    He said commodity operations deputy administrator RalphKlopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour andwill meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.    Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at thatmeeting, including the current concern over the gulf cornpremiums.    He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these pricemargins reflect an average of prices throughout the year andthat seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase ordecrease.    The USDA official also said that only those counties thatuse the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by thehigh barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.    When asked if the USDA emergency storage program whichallows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge spaceand accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discountedthe idea.    He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges andthat, under provisions of the program, these all have to beemptied by the end of March. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, LEADING ECONOMISTS CALL FOR MORE GROWTH ABROAD, A panel of four leading economiststold a congressional hearing today that foreign economies willneed to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficitdeclines.    C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Departmentofficial, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution toldthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exportingcountries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S.demand for imports is expected to fall.    "They need to beef up domestic demand as their tradesurplus falls," or unemployment will keep growing, Bergstensaid.    Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169billion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year forthe next two years as a result of the dollar's 35-40 pctdecline since September 1985.    The government should intervene to push the dollar downfurther if the previous declines do not lead to an improvementin the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reducedand if foreign expansion does not occur, he added.    Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate forthe huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. TheParis agreement between the major industrialized countriesprovided only for a pause in its decline, he said.    Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan GuarantyTrust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem oflagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currencymisalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, andunbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries.

reut2-007.sgm, UNIQUE EXPORT FINANCING BEING ARRANGED FOR MEXICO, A single purpose company, &lt;ItalfundingLtd>, has been created for the purpose of obtaining funds onthe international capital markets to refinance 44.3 mln dlrs ofMexico's official debt to Italy at very attractive rates,Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd said as lead manager and arranger.    The transaction will be accomplished by Italfundingobtaining a 44.3 mln dlr euronote facility in the market andthen using the proceeds to provide a loan for the same amountto Mexico. The loan will be 100 pct guaranteed by SACE, theofficial Italian export credit agency.    Morgan Grenfell has used special purpose vehicles in thepast to help refinance export credits for other indebtedcountries, such as Brazil and Ecuador.    The Brazil financing, for example, involved the use of afloating rate note. This transaction makes use of anothersector of the capital markets -- that for short-term notefacilities -- to finance a medium term credit.    The financing is being arranged in connection with abilateral agreement between Mexico and SACE earlier this yearto refinance Mexico's official debt to Italy.    The bilateral accord followed a multilateral reschedulingagreement reached last September of Mexico's official debt tothe Paris Club of western creditor governments.    The Paris Club accord, in turn, was part of a broad-basedrescheduling package covering 77 billion dlrs of Mexico'sforeign debt.    That package -- heralded as the first to incorporate allaspects of U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's plan to aidindebted countries -- included a 7.7 billion dlr loan, whichwas signed today in New York.     The new financing forItalfunding, being syndicated among about five majorinternational banks, will be a fully underwritten, revolvingfacility with an average life of seven years and the facilitywill fund the loan.    All Paris Club agreements contain a generally acceptedoutline for a rescheduling, but the specific terms must then benegotiated on a bilateral basis.    Banking sources noted that the use of a special-purposevehicle will provide Mexico with particularly attractivefinancing at a rate of about 1/4 to 1/2 pct over the LondonInterbank Offered Rate (Libor).    The cost of the new financing compares with a spread of13/16 pct on the loans in the new commercial bank package.    This is because the intermediary providing the funds, inthis case Italfunding, can obtain its funds relatively cheaplyon the international markets. At the same time, the dealbenefits the banks, which will still get a reasonable return onthe note facility, which is pure Italian risk.    The bankers noted that if the financing had been arrangedin Italy, the cost to Mexico and the Italian banks would havebeen higher since the Italian banks would use a differentsource of funding.

reut2-007.sgm, WESTPAC PERPETUAL FRN NO INSTANT CURE, DEALERS SAY, Morgan Guaranty Ltd's novel and complexrepackaging of Westpac Banking Corp's perpetual floating ratenote (FRN) may attract some investors, but is unlikely to aidcurrent holders of the Westpac securities or the FRN market,FRN traders said.    "It actually does nothing for anyone who has been stuffedand right now, that's the problem," said a trader at one U.K.Clearing bank that has also issued its own perpetuals.    Trading in perpetual issues, which pay interest but nevermature, has come to a virtual halt. Prices have fallen so farthat only about five firms still make markets in them.    The Westpac perpetual notes are technically now theproperty of a newly formed single-purpose finance subsidiary,Pacific Securities. If Morgan tried to find a home for theactual Westpac notes, as is, they would be paid no more than 85cents on the dollar, at most, traders said.    But the repackaging allows them to target a new class ofinvestor for the notes and take the old issues off their bookswithout registering a loss, the traders said.    "The only one the repackaging favours is Morgan," a tradersaid.    Meanwhile, the end-holders of perpetual notes, most of whomare Japanese banks, must still find a way to value them byyear-end, now a week away.    From Morgan's point of view, the repackaging does aid thepresent holders of the notes as well as offering value to a newclass of investors.    "At least we've put a floor under the price of the notes.We've created a way to set a real value for them," one Morganofficial said. Morgan had earlier attempted, but abandoned,another plan to repackage the Westpac securities.    Morgan's holdings of Westpac paper create special problemsfor it because of the way U.S. Regulators view bank holdings ofthe primary capital of other banks, traders said. Therefore, itis crucial that a vehicle for selling the paper be found.    And indeed, note traders said, the FRN portion of therepackaged securities -- which Westpac has offered to redeemfor cash in 15 years -- does have real value.    For one thing, traders noted, it pays about the highestrate over the London Interbank Offered Rate of virtually anynewly issued security. The spread is 50 basis points.    However, the other portion of the security, in which theinvestor pays 20 cents on the dollar for a zero coupon 15-yearbond, is of dubious value unless the Westpac perpetual assumesa market value near par 15 years from now, traders said.    The zero-coupon portion could provide value for an accountwhich for tax purposes, wants to take a large capital loss, thetraders said. In the 15-year period between the time the noteis purchased and the time it is redeemed, no interest is paid.    When repayment finally occurs, it is not in cash like anordinary zero-coupon bond. Instead, the investor receives oneof the Westpac perpetual floaters. REUTER&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, UN CONFERENCE FORMALLY ADOPTS NEW RUBBER PACT, A new International Natural RubberAgreement, INRA, was formally adopted by a United NationsConference today.    The new accord is due to replace the current one, whichexpires in October.    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said theformal adoption represented "a historic moment."    The latest round of talks, which began March 9, representedthe fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years.Xuto described the negotiations as "by no means easy, and weoften faced problems."    The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally whenratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world netexports and 75 pct of net imports.    The new INRA will enter into force definitively whengovernments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and80 pct of net imports have ratified it.    It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31this year.    It is expected that provisional entry into force will takeat least 12 to 14 months from now, delegates said.    During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stockoperations will be suspended, but the International NaturalRubber Council will remain in place.    Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and itssuccessor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers andconsumers of natural rubber over the long term.    Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xutoadded. He also praised "the spirit of 'give' and 'take' thatprevailed throughout this session."    Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers,said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutualityof interests between producers and consumers is now as valid asit was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the1970s.    Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basisof predictable stable prices is "a vital consideration formultinational tire companies, whether or not consumingcountries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriouslyconcerned about security of the rubber supply."    He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement hadserved the purpose for which it was created.    Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accessionto the new pact "to avoid an undue gap between the old and thenew.    Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers,agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well.    But as economic conditions had changed, he said, consumershad been led to make proposals for improving its functioning.    He added that the adoption of the new agreement "attests tothe importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry." Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, MEXICO WARNS OF WORSENING THIRD WORLD DEBT WOES, High interest rates, sluggish globaleconomic growth and creeping protectionism are deepening thethird world debt crisis, senior Mexican officials said.    Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said today's signing ofa 76 billion dlr new-loan and rescheduling package for Mexicowas the most comprehensive and far-reaching effort in debtmanagement yet achieved for a sovereign borrower.    But, in remarks prepared for the signing ceremony, hewarned against complacency. "The debt problem is not solved. Ifanything, it has been exacerbated by recent events."    "The inequities of the international economic environmentconspire against the welfare and stability of developingcountries," Petricioli added. The debt problem will not besolved unless developing countries are allowed to grow, heargued. "There will be no solution without the furtherdevelopment of trade throughout the world.".    Director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters thatMexico's economy should resume growth this year, but he saidexternal conditions are not favorable. Latin America isgrappling with adverse terms of trade, for instance, asunderlined by the recent slide in coffee prices.    Interest rates remain unacceptably high in real terms,Gurria added. "Inflation has literally disappeared from theface of the earth in the industrialized world, but interestrates are still near seven pct."    Industrial powers must also improve the coordination oftheir economic policies to boost unacceptably low growth ratesand to keep export markets open, said Gurria, who is Mexico'schief debt negotiator.    The officials also had a blunt warning for those banks thatrefuse to participate in the loan package: Do not expect to getmuch business with Mexico in the future.    About 60 of Mexico's 430 or so creditor banks worldwidehave still to join the loan, but four more acceptances werereceived today, according to senior Citibank executive WilliamRhodes, who is co-chairman of Mexico's advisory committee.    "Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico willcontinue to be open and willing to share with them the businessopportunities which its future growth will create.    "Those few who have denied their responsibility have turnedtheir backs on this remarkable effort of internationalcooperation, on the financial system and on their enlightenedcolleagues," Petricioli said.    One way that Mexico could punish recalcitrant banks wouldbe to deny, or at least slow down, applications to convertMexican debt into equity investments within the country.    "We will be a lot more expeditious in processing therequests of banks that have supported us," Gurria said, adding,"We have long memories."    Debt-equity conversions are an attractive way for banks toprovide clients with subsidized pesos for investment in Mexicoand to collect handsome brokerage fees or reduce their ownMexican exposure in the process.        The growing popularity of the scheme was underlined thisweek when American Express Bank, which has joined the newMexican package, said it plans to convert 100 mln dlrs of itsown loans into an equity stake in hotel projects in Mexico.    Mexico halted the debt-equity program on Feb. 25 to forcebanks to concentrate on wrapping up the financing pakcage, andGurria said it would resume once the first part of the sixbillion dlr loan that forms the core of the deal is disbursed.    The loan is now 99 pct subscribed. Gurria said Mexico hopesto close the books by the middle of April in time for adrawdown by the end of April.    Although the agreements were signed in the sumptuoussurroundings of a midtown Manhattan hotel, the atmosphere ofthe signing ceremony was rather subdued, with bankers andofficials showing little of the elation and relief thatnormally follows the conclusion of a mammoth deal.    After five months of arduous work syndicating the loan,debt fatigue was apparent and the talk was of ways to make thefinancing process less cumbersome.    "This (package) has been harder than all the others... Ihope we find a way that's not so debilitating for the peoplewho have to put them together," Gurria said. Reuter&#3;

A spokesman said the company had previously expected thisto be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated howfar into 1988 the process will extend. It still expects tocomplete the entire clean-up by the end of 1988, he added.    GPU said its auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, again qualifiedits opinion of GPU's financial statements, adding the recoveryof TMI-2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leadingto the qualified opinion.    GPU said its operating subsidiaries will seek to recoverthe costs of decommissioning TMI-2 in future rate proceedings.    As in past years, the qualified opinion continues to listother uncertainties associated with the accident, which damagedTMI-2 -- the recovery of cleanup costs and any payments fordamages that might exceed available insurance proceeds.

reut2-007.sgm, CONCERN OVER "EL NINO" IN PERU - USDA REPORT, There are heightened fears that "ElNino" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continentsand caused widespread damage through floods and drought, theU.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a fieldreport.    Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area,flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led toincreased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.    However, it said official sources still believe that thisyear's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.    EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds andwaters in the pacific.    The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now beingexperienced has not had an overall negative impact onagricultural production.    Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduceyields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in thecrop cycle.    Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive whereexcessive moisture exists, it said.    However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supplyof irrigation water in the major dams which will improveprospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, andslow the decline in sugar production, it said.    If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry couldreceive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fishcatch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.    Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are threeto four degrees centigrade above normal but still not highenough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.    It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino willintensify and carry on through late March, April and Maycausing problems as crops approach harvest.    "There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino-- only time will tell," the report said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-007.sgm, ALLIED-LYONS SEES SUBSTANTIAL SECOND HALF GROWTH, &lt;Allied-Lyons PLC> will reportsubstantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 endedMarch 7, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in answer toreporters' queries.    "You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyonsin the second half," Holden-Brown said following a presentationto Toronto securities analysts.    Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth inprofit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported inthe first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mlnstg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.    Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary costof slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costsassociated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for thecompany, Holden-Brown also said.    But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinarygain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pctinterest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.    "So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. Buthopefully you win them all in the end," Holden-Brown said.    Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to othertake-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: "No, I don't."    "We must never be complacent and we must always be verywatchful, but I think we would be very expensive," he said.    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporateearnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companiesin the food and beverage industry.    "That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians hadcome a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, Ithink," Holden-Brown said.    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire HiramWalker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elderstake-over bid for the company was "100 pct a growth action."    "We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, andthat people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was)defensive, but it never was," Holden-Brown told reporters.    Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a shareissue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in HiramWalker, Holden-Brown responded: "Plan might be too strong aword. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to bebetter known in Canada." Reuter&#3;

Shearson acted asco-manager in the underwriting of units of Fireman's commonstock and warrants last May, was also served with a subpoena,it said.    American Express said the subpoena to Shearson relates totransactions with Jefferies and Co and others.    American Express said it and Shearson intend to comply withall requests from the SEC and to cooperate fully. AmericanExpress said neither company is aware of any unlawful conductwith respect to the matters and a thorough investigation iscontinuing.    American Express said the subpoenas were receivedyesterday, and that it and Shearson were unaware of any inquiryprior to receiving the subpoenas.    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, founder of Jefferies Group, saidhe agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of securitiesviolations.    Jefferies also settled charges with the Securities andExchange Commission of market manipulation and another schemewith Ivan Boesky, who has settled SEC charges of insidertrading.    Jefferies' firm was censured by the SEC and ordered toretain an outside consultant to review its procedures.    In documents filed on Jefferies yesterday, the SEC did notidentify who was involved in the market manipulation schemeaside from Jefferies. It said "a certain issuer," which heldcontrolling interest in a second public company, offeredseveral mln shares of the company's common stock to the publicin a secondary offering during 1986.    The SEC alleged that Boyd Jefferies carried out a schemewith an unidentified person to drive up the price of the secondcompany's stock prior to the offering by having the Jefferiesfirm trade in the stock.    Jefferies and co was allegedly compensated for the lossfrom those trading activities after sending a fake invoice toanother unnamed person, the government charged.    American Express first offered Fireman's Fund Corp's stockto the public in 1985. It lowered its holding from 100 pct to41 pct. In May, 1986, it reduced its ownership interest to 27pct by completing a public offering of nine mln units.    Each unit consisted of one share of common and one warrantto buy Fireman's fund. The warrants are exercisable from theissue date through March, 1989.    At the same time, American Express sold warrants directlyto Fireman's Fund to purchase five mln shares. Those warrantsare exercisable between November, 1988 and March 1991.    American Express said if all warrants were exercised itwould own about 13 pct of Fireman's fund.    American Express stock fell 1-1/2, to 77-1/4 on volume of1.9 mln shares. The stock had been strong in the last two days,first on rumors, then an announcement of an understandingAmerican Express reached to sell Nippon Life Insurance Co 13pct of Shearson.    Wall Street has also been anticipating American Expresswill sell a stake in the brokerage unit to the public as well.    E.F. Hutton analyst Michael Lewis said he does not believethe subpoenas will affect Nippon's deal with American Express,but it could result in a delay of the public offeringanticipated for Shearson.    "If they're forced to keep a bigger percentage of Shearsona little longer...big deal. They're certainly not going tothrow Shearson away. Shearson is still an attractive asset," hesaid.    American Express has not commented on speculation it wouldoffer part of Shearson to the public, but it has said it wascontinuing to review options for the brokerage.    Analysts had speculated an offering of a part of Shearsonwould be forthcoming shortly.

reut2-007.sgm, BALLY &lt;BLY> SEEN SELLING OFF HEALTH UNIT, Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposedpublic offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit isseen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit,analysts said.    "In the longer-term horizon, Bally wants to concentrate onits gaming businesses," said analyst Dennis Forst of SeidlerAmdec Securities Inc.    Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale ofanother non-casino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit,which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs.    Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said "the company currentlyhas no hard plans to the sell any more of the health clubcompany, but in the long term we'll wait and see how theoffering goes."    Once Bally's biggest revenue producer, the health club unithad 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2mln dlrs, 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate theunit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs.    Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unitcould be the first step to selling it.    "It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease thehealth club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operatingincome, making it an attractive buy to a third party," StevenEisenberg of Bear Stearns said.    On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities andExchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8mln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share.   About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduceparent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchaseof shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostiletakeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson.    Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from aseparate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertiblesubordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs ofshort term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Ballyspokesperson said.    Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits haveremained strong, but are skeptical about the industry's longrange prospects.    "The fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, hasgrown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or apermanent part of our lifestyle," said Eisenberg of BearStearns.    Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if thepublic stays at its peak of health consciousness, but thatovercapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes.     In addition, "the returns in the fitness club industry arejust not as high as they are in the gaming industry," said oneanalyst.     There are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the U.S., excludingclubs run by not-for-profit organizations, according to theAssociation of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to bean 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry.     Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit, which is thenation's largest health club chain, Peltier said, "no one hasthe money to offer to buy it."    "The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with noleader and there is a great opportunity for growth throughacquisition and then standardization," said Wayne LaChapelle,chief financial officer of Livingwell INc &lt;WELL>, the nation'ssecond largest fitness chain operator whih    LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested inacquisition opportunities but "could not afford an acquisitionthe size of Bally at this time."

reut2-007.sgm, BANKS HAD EXCESS POSITIONS WITH VW - NEWSLETTER, A financial newsletter which reportedlast November that car maker Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> lost largesums in currency transactions alleged that unnamed banks hadcircumvented banking regulations with help from VW's foreignexchange department.    VW had no immediate comment and there was nothing in thereport by the newsletter, the Platow Brief, to link its newallegations with a suspected currency swindle at VW which isnow being investigated by a prosecutor.    VW said this month that it had had to make provision forpossible losses up to 480 mln marks in the possible currencyfraud.    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office inWest Berlin said the office was aware that the newsletter hadmade the new allegations and would follow this with interest.    Platow Brief said around 16 mainly foreign banks based inWest Germany had "parked" excess open positions in currencytrading with VW's foreign exchange department.    Under West German banking law, banks may not end a tradingday with open positions totalling more than 30 pct of theircapital. During the day banks buy and sell currencies, usuallyaiming to match up all deals by the end and balance theirbooks.    Some traders who take a view on how currencies will movemay prefer to leave certain positions open, a speculativesituation that the German regulations are designed to limit.    According to Platow Brief, some traders apparently weregetting round the regulation by getting VW to buy or sellcurrencies and hold them temporarily so that their books weresquared. Up to 100 mln dlrs was sometimes involved.    Non-bank corporations are not covered by the restrictions,imposed after a bank crash in 1974 to protect bank depositors.    Breaches of the Banking Law in this way can be punished bya fine for the dealers involved, and in extreme cases byremoval of the managers, if their active involvement is proved.    But the Federal Banking Supervisory Office said it firsthad to be established how far, if at all, regulations werebreached.    The suspected VW currency swindle meanwhile involvedoperations to protect the company against fluctuations in thevalue of the dollar, VW spoksmen have said.    Some operations to hedge against changes in currency valueswere not completed, meaning VW stood to lose money.

Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of theEF Hutton publication "Global Crop News," said in her latestreport that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.    "Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Sovietwinter grain crop) is far more pessimistic," she said. "Butit's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lotwill depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of thetroubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting."    Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probablyprevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheatgrowing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasusreceived on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.    The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke recordlows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken itstoll on Soviet winter crops, she said.    However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt hadample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majorityof crop areas from severe frost damage.    The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grainsin the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily fromCanada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,Martell said.    She cited a number of reasons besides possible cropproblems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.    Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing onmoisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weathernecessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.    Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobylaccident may have contaminated more grain than originallythought and have to be made up with imports.    However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of lastresort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have onlyjust recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.    Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to theUSSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.    In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grainimports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Unionbought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only24 pct of that total.    While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised theirestimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-007.sgm, MEXICO'S RESERVES REACH EIGHT BILLION DLRS, Additional capital inflows of 1.5billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves toabout eight billion dlrs, director of public credit AngelGurria told reporters.    Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improvedinvestor confidence and because a tight monetray policy hasforced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflowstotalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986.    Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for thesake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool offunds available for badly needed investment.    Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan isdrawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only haveenough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four orfive months, Gurria noted.    Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw onthe commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-supportcontingency facility. That money will be available until April1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fallbelow certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for thefirst two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria saidtoday, "We expect we'll never have to use it."    Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw onthe second contingency facility included in the bank financingpackage - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the WorldBank.    Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signedyesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support thedevelopment of exports of manufactured goods.    He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billiondlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil andexport promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month.    Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from itsInternational Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few daysbased on a successful review of end-1986 economic results.    Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages ofdiscussions which will determine quantitative economic targetsfor 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMFfor the rest of 1987.    Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eightbilateral accords with government creditors within the ParisClub.    Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrellaagreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrsof official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalizepacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks.    In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, hesaid all countries from the Organization of EconomicCooperation and Development have continued to provide exportcredit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.

At the company's annual meeting, he said an acquisitioncould take place in the next 24 months.    "The company has nearly two billion dlrs available foracquisition today," Panic said, adding, "We are investigating anumber of companies." One company being studied could possiblybe acquired on a friendly basis, he said.    Panic also said he intends to seek board approval today torepurchase up to three mln ICN common shares.    Discussing the possibility of an acquisition, Panic saidthe such a purchase is necessary because ICN's currentmarketing capability would not be sufficient to supportdistribution of the company's products, given ICN'sexpectations for market growth worldwide.    ICN's principal product is ribavirin, also known asVirazole. The drug is marketed in a number of countries anddescribed as a broad-based anti-viral.    The company has said its possible applications includetreatment of some types of hepatitis, herpes, influenza,childhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers.    ICN has been the focus of consirable investor attention inrecent months because of Virazole, which has undergone clinicaltrials as a possible treatment of some AIDS-related diseases.    Panic said today he would not discuss the drug with regardto AIDS until the Food and Drug Administration completes itsreview of data submitted by the company.    He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by aHouse Subcommittee is continuing.    The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they areconducting separate investigations to determine whether or notICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug.    Virazole is approved for marketing in the U.S. in aerosolform as a treatment for an infection that strikes infants,called respiratory syncytial virus. Reuter&#3;

Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreedmember states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next fewyears the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the mainsource of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, withtougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 andfor all new vehicles from October 1990.    The EC's executive Commission says the emission level ofnitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a yearfrom three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if allheavy vehicles applied to the new standards.    There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use inthe EC, according to Commission figures.    The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to movetowards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonnrequested permission to do so to encourage the use oflow-pollution cars, diplomats said.    West Germany will still need ministers' final approval forsuch a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when ECenvironment ministers meet next on May 21.    But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germanydid not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wideban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.    Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomatssaid. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk nodamage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.    Under EC law, ministers have to give member states specialpermission if they wish to be exempt from Community competitionlaws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implementa ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol. Reuter&#3;
