reut2-012.sgm, SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER, Speculation the United States willoffer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to havereached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary ofState George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheatmarkets since officials from the two countries held theircustomary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow'sdecision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn marketstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand inthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export EnhancementProgram, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit toMoscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representativeshere as a clear signal that the Reagan administration waspreparing an offer.    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lippedabout the prospects of a subsidy offer.    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned thecontention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whomasked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that anoffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,are saying they would not rule one out.    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as topredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten daysto two weeks.    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaderswho had been in contact with administration officials.    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancementoffer would be made by the middle of this month.    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would endup being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier thisyear when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrsper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheatsubsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases ofU.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat dealwould appear to be price.    Last summer the administration took the controversial stepof offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but wereembarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the groundsthat the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat pricesfar above world market prices.    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level upfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be ameans of controlling the price while attempting to dampencriticism, grain trade sources said.    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultzfrom saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington wasoffering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available toU.S. housewives.    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representativeshere is that a general warming of relations between the twocountries since last summer, combined with continued hard timesin the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would considerbuying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstancessurrounding the administration's announcement of the wheatsubsidy offer last summer.    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional andindustry leaders were led to believe the White House haddecided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include notonly the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer toinclude only the Soviets.    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure ofuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convincedthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity tosell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

reut2-012.sgm, ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES, The restoration of coffee export quotasbefore the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by InternationalCoffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resumenegotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegatestold reporters.    Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening thequota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, theysaid.    Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectivelytorpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotasbefore October, the delegates noted.    Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forcedcoffee futures in London and New York to new lows today,traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr inearly trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said.    Producer delegates said that while the possibility ofreimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, inpractice the idea had effectively been discarded.    The ICO's executive board session here this week has so farbarely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating generalunwillingness to revive talks while chances of success arestill remote, producer delegates said.    Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored,despite the price collapse seen since the failure of lastmonth's negotiations, they said.    "With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants tonegotiate quotas," one leading producer delegate said.    Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season(mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks asinsurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil'scrop.    Many producers are more interested in working towardsreimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system ofquota allocations valid until the International CoffeeAgreement expires in 1989, they said.    Guatemala has already proposed the "other oilds" producergroup should meet in the next two months to begin talks on howto allocate quota shares.    Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quotadistribution system, with some producer delegates reportinggrowing support for a radical reallocation, based on theprinciple of "objective criteria" favoured by consumers.    At last month's council session a splinter group of smallproducers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based onexportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia andthe rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocationsunchanged, except for some temporary adjustments.    A delegate from one of the eight said more producers nowsupported their cause.    The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showedreadiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quotaaccord in October also looked bleak.    The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined tomake reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution ofquota shares based on "objective criteria."    ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would beprepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meetsin September.    Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on externaldebt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee,they said.    They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee exportregistrations might reflect fears this would provoke anotherprice slide and force an emergency ICO council session, whichwould most likely end in failure.    Producers met this afternoon to review the market situationbut had only a general discussion about how furthernegotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said.    Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and thenmay set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are notfixed, he said.    The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local timeto hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The boardmeeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled,delegates said.

reut2-012.sgm, YUGOSLAVIA WINS TIME IN PARIS CLUB REFINANCING, Yugoslavia has won breathing space fromits major official creditors through yesterday's Paris Clubrefinancing agreement but it will take time for it to resolveits economic crisis, economists at western embassies said.    Yugoslav delegation chief Finance Minister SvetozarRikanovic said a refinancing was agreed for 475 mln dlrs ofdebt falling due between May 16 this year and May 31, 1988.    The agreement was the second multi-year Yugoslav debtrefinancing, based on a protocol signed last May which usheredin "enhanced monitoring" of Yugoslavia's economy by the IMF.    Western economists who follow Yugoslav financial affairssaid a similar deal would probably emerge from talks withcommercial creditors at the end of this month. But they saidthe refinancings would only provide a breathing space, becauseYugoslavia has to repay 5.5 billion dlrs in 1987.    And the country is still struggling to reverse a dramaticdecline in export earnings, which have fallen 12.5 pct so farthis year, continuing a downward spiral of the past 18 months.    The Yugoslav hard currency debt has grown from 1.2 billiondlrs in 1965 to stand at 19.7 billion dlrs at the end of 1986and is one of the country's most dire economic problems.    The debt began to snowball in the 1960s and 1970s due to anexcessive investment rate exceeding the growth of the GrossSocial Product and necessitating additional foreign borrowing.    Rising international oil prices in the 1970s proved to be aserious blow to the country's balance of payments.    Deputy Prime Minister Milos Milosavljevic said this monththat Yugoslavia had repaid 640 mln dlrs of principal and 325mln dlrs of interest so far this year.    According to official Yugoslav figures, Yugoslavia repaid arecord 5.97 billion dlrs in capital and interest in 1986,reducing overall indebtedness by 996 mln dlrs.    Mikulic is trying to rein in rampant retail inflation ofalmost 100 pct a year through price and incomes controls.    Janez Zemljaric, also a Deputy Prime Minister, saidrecently Yugoslavia expected a "definite measure ofunderstanding" from its 16 major western creditor nations.    Western economists said Yugoslavia has had its way with theParis Club creditors but that not all creditors were satisfiedwith its economic performance last year. They said the Parisdiscussions were heated and emotional.    "Economic factors were balanced by political realities," aneconomist at one of the main embassies here said, but addedthat creditors had no complaints regarding Yugoslavia'srepayment record because it had so far always repaid debts ontime.    Yugoslavia has refinanced its debt regularly since 1983.    In December 1985, it signed a deal with the InternationalCoordinating Committee of 600 commercial banks to refinancematurities arising between January 1, 1985 and end-1988.    It had signed bilateral refinancing agreements in March ofthat year for maturities arising from January 1, 1985 to March25, 1986, following an agreement in Paris on March 25, 1985.    Government ministers told Reuters this month thatYugoslavia had made too great an effort to repay its debts in1986, at great cost to the economy, and that this wasregretted.    Mikulic has said Yugoslavia is unlikely to follow Brazil'slead and suspend its debt repayments "but we have understandingfor what that country did."    Western economists said, however, that Mikulic's remarks,taken with those of his ministers, could be a signal that someproblems were seen ahead in refinancing debt repayments.    Before the Paris talks, some Yugoslav officials had hintedthat Yugoslavia could start to look to the Soviet Bloc forfinancial support if Belgrade failed to secure the necessaryrefinancing from western creditors.    Sources close to the western creditors, however, said theydid not view the threat as serious. REUTER&#3;

U.K. Authorities have lost patience with Japanese tradingpractices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate withoutunleashing a damaging trade war. "Toshiba's timing seems mostunfortunate for the company, as it comes exactly when we arelooking for someone to punch," one official told Reuters.    Earlier, &lt;Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd> said itwanted to enter the British business facsimile and keytelephone market. A facsimile machine sends printed data overtelephone lines, while a key telephone system is used forswitching calls within a business, industry sources said.    The move by Toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute overJapan's refusal to open up its telecommunications market toforeign companies. "Toshiba's timing is most extraordinary," oneofficial at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said.    Tomorrow, the U.K. Government will consider what legalaction it can possible take to press for Japanese reform.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has given notice that theU.K. Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to preventCable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> from taking a significantposition in a new Japanese international telecommunicationsventure. "We regard this as a test case," she told Parliament.    But while the U.K. Is keen to see some movement on theissue by Japan, it is also worried that recent anti-Japaneserhetoric may cause developments to get out of hand, officialssaid.    Japanese officials in Tokyo today reiterated that Japan hadno plans to bow to U.K. And U.S. Pressure to give foreigntelecommunications firms a bigger role there.    The government, for which competition and the deregulationof markets are major political themes, is unlikely to makefinal decisions tomorrow on how to act against Japan, officialssaid.    Detailed consideration of the issue has been shelved duringThatcher's official visit to the Soviet Union, which endstoday.    "We are waiting for the Prime Minister to decide what to do.The DTI will pass the ball to her as soon as she returnstonight," a DTI official said.    He said Toshiba's application would be considered by theOffice of Telecommunications (OFTEL). An OFTEL spokeswoman said"a decision on this application will take weeks, maybe months."    Asked whether Toshiba's bid would fall victim to Britishretaliation, the OFTEL spokeswoman said: "Who knows what's goingto happen given the current situation!"    A Toshiba executive, who asked not to be named, toldReuters: "We do not anticipate any special problems."    Some analysts queried by Reuters questioned the basis ofBritain's strong stand on the Cable and Wireless bid. One saidthat the company's proposal was equivalent to a Japanesecompany wanting to take a stake in Mercury International, thesubsidiary of Cable and Wireless that is the only realcompetitor of British Telecommunications Plc &lt;BTY.L>.    British Corporate Affairs minister Michael Howard leavesfor Japan on Saturday.    The minister will seek a clear timetable from Japan foreasier access for British institutions to Japanese financialmarkets, reciprocating the easy access Japanese securitieshouses and banks have to the City of London.    Britain has threatened to use its new Financial ServicesAct to revoke or deny licences to Japanese brokerage houses ifit does not get satisfaction.    But British authorities would be far from happy if forcedto use that weapon, government sources said.    Sir Nicholas Goodison, Chairman of the London StockExchange, said in New York yesterday that sanctions againstJapanese financial institutions operating in the U.K. Would setback London's ambition to become a leading centre for corporatefinancing and securities trading.    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also warnedyesterday of the negative effects that a trade war could haveon the British economy. Such a development could hit U.K.Exports and sharply alter the outlook for the next generalelection in which economic recovery will be one of thegovernment's main themes, political analysts said.

He added that, ironically, the prime raterises may help the market to stabilise since the dollar rose onthe back of the news.    The only U.S. Dollar deal launched during the day was, ashas been the case recently, equity linked. The 15-yearconvertible bond was for the Bank of Tokyo Ltd and has anindicated coupon of two pct. One source at a house involved inthe deal said, "It's got to be a blow-out. With a name like thisyou're talking about Japan Inc."    The lead manager was the Bank of Tokyo International (BOTI)and the deal ended far above the par issue price at 108 109pct. A BOTI official said "We've had worldwide interest in thedeal."    She noted the Tokyo stock market had experienced a mildcorrection at the beginning of the week but that bank stockswere hardly affected.    The yen sector edged slightly firmer and one new straightdeal was launched, a 20 billion yen bond for France's CaisseNationale des Telecommunications.

The issue was lead managed by IBJ International Ltd and wasquoted on the grey market at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct comparedwith the total fees of 1-7/8 pct. One syndicate official at afirm not involved in the deal said "It's tight, but overall Iwould say its fairly priced."    Also launched was a five-year zero coupon bond with a totalredemption amount of 19 billion yen for Rural Banking andFinance Corp of New Zealand. It was priced at 81.22 pct andlead managed by Nomura International.    In the Australian dollar sector, GMAC (Australia) FinanceLtd issued a 50 mln Australian dlr bond.    Hambros Bank Ltd was lead manager for the four-year dealwhich pays 14-1/4 pct and was priced at 101 pct. It wasguranteed by General Motors Acceptance Corp and was quoted onthe 1-3/4 pct fees at less 1-3/4 pct bid.

U.K. Authorities have lost patience with Japanese tradingpractices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate withoutunleashing a damaging trade war.

The move by Toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute overJapan's refusal to open up its telecommunications market toforeign companies. "Toshiba's timing is most extraordinary," oneofficial at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said.    Tommorrow, the U.K. Government will consider what legalaction it can possible take to press for Japanese reform.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has given notice that theU.K. Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to preventCable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> from taking a significantposition in a new Japanese international telecommunicationsventure.

Answering questions before a House appropriationssubcommittee, Baker told a questioner, "I disagree with yourcrisis characterization" regarding Brazil.    He said that while the U.S. Treasury regretted Brazil'sinterest payment moratorium on commercial bank debt, "We hopeand believe they'll resolve this through direct negotiations(with the banks)."    Baker said the financial community around the worldbelieves it imperative that Brazil come up with a comprehensiveprogram to adjust its economy.    In other comments on foreign debt, Baker said the situationhas improved since mid-1982 because the banks are in muchbetter shape and have rebuilt reserves.    He also noted interest rates are considerably lower todaythan they were when the crisis broke out and the rate ofincrease in debt has slowed considerably.    In addition, Baker noted a number of debtors are makingreasonably good economic progress, and he cited Mexico inparticular.    He pointed out that Venezuela, Chile and the Philippineshave all reached agreement with commercial banks on debtrescheduling and Argentina was in the midst of negotiations.    But he rejected calls for "overnight solutions" to the debtcrisis. "There is no chance they can get out (of the debtcrisis)," Baker said, unless debtor countries generate economicgrowth.    Baker said the U.S. initiative to shore up debtor nationsdepends on that concept, and he rejected calls for debtforgiveness, which, he said, would cut debtor nations off fromaccess to private credit.    Baker noted that even though Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) wasurging debt relief in his strategy for dealing with the debtsituation, "More and more now, he bases this on the concept ofgrowth."    Other indicators of progress include, Baker said, debtornations negotiating better and better terms with commercialbanks. "The points over LIBOR are much less," he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT, Calls for a cut in Austrian interestrates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are dividedover the issue.    Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse undKommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half apercentage point in interest rates across the board. But HannesAndrosch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI> toldReuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.    Vak told a news conference that last January's cut inlending rates for commercial customers and for all depositorsby a quarter point had been insufficient.    The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering ofits discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with asimilar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct anddeposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.    Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the GenossenschaftlicheZentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of apoint, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.    Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. Awidening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West Germancredit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growththis year also justified a further interest drop, he said.    Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank deroesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called forlower deposit rates but said lending rates should remainunchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,particularly when compared with other West European countries.    But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste OesterreichischeSpar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unlessWest German rates came down first.    Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower ratesalone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcomingopposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank. REUTER&#3;

Niagara Mohawk'sPrime-2 commercial paper was left unchanged.    Moody's said the rate decision last month by the PublicService Commission would significantly pressure NiagaraMohawk's coverage of fixed charges.    Moreover, cost increases associated with the in-servicedelay of the 41 pct owned Nine Mile Unit 2 from September 1987to early 1988, along with prospective delays, are unlikely tobe recovered under the cost-settlement agreement for thenuclear unit, Moody's noted.

reut2-012.sgm, CURRENCY INTERVENTION TIMING CRUCIAL - ANALYSTS, The dollar's recent decline, despitemassive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder thatofficial intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only ifit is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentalsor sentiment, dealers and analysts said.    Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, withoutaccompanying policy changes, they stand little chance ofreversing the direction of an ever-growing global market inwhich more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, thesources said.    "Timing and psychology are the key to successfulintervention," said Jim O'Neill, a financial markets economistwith Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementarychanges in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday whena change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantlyachieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for aweek through open market intervention.    After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, thedollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50yen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low.    By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bankof Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billiondlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent thedollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year lowMonday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks havelost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar.The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a centralbank foray, but is no longer mesmerized.    "They've lost their credibility. The market feels it cantake on the central banks and win," said Michael Snow, head oftreasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.    The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharpcontrast to the success that central banks scored when theyjoined forces to drive the dollar down following the September22, 1985, Plaza accord.    Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it,because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrialpowers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower toredress massive worldwide trade imbalances.    Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying thatthe dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit isshowing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting ina bid to protect its export industries.    For its part, the United States is apparently content tolet the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little morethan lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Groupof Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say.    Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buyingintervention has been half-hearted, designed more as apolitical gesture to Japan than to strike fear into themarkets. "It's been pro-forma intervention," said FrancoiseSoares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais.    Because of this discord and the market's momentum for alower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail.    "It's going to take a lot more than the central banks tohold the dollar (at these levels)," said Snow, who predictsanother 10 to 15 pct depreciation.    "There have to be structural changes that occur to make themarket stop selling dollars," added "Buying six billion dollarsin three weeks is not going to do it."    Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter,when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack,central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billiondlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollarfalling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said.    Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. "Idon't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they sawthe futility of it in the seventies."    Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and boundsince then, intervention on an even greater scale wouldprobably be needed to impress the market.    Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone lastyear averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to ajoint central bank study, about double the previous estimatemade just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty privateresearch group.    There are signs that central banks, too, realize thefutility of swimming against the tide.    Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier thisweek that they believed the limits of currency marketintervention are perhaps being reached and that other methodsfor bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swapagreements with other central banks, are being considered.    "In this era of financial liberalization, it's almostimpossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,"one senior official in Tokyo said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, TALKS WILL NOT DELAY TRADE CURBS AGAINST JAPAN, President Reagan's move to imposestiff tariffs on Japanese goods stems from deep U.S.frustration over Japan's trade policy, and he has no intentionof calling off the sanctions, trade analysts said.    U.S. officials put down any idea of delaying imposing the300 mln dlrs in tariffs, despite seemingly contradictorycomments by some Administration aides.    And, they add, a visit here next week by Japanese tradeofficials and a visit to Tokyo by a senior State Departmentofficial will likely do nothing to change U.S. minds.    "Do not expect the problem to be resolved or the sanctionsnot to go into effect," said a senior U.S. trade official.    Reagan last Friday announced that on April 17 he wouldraise tariffs on certain Japanese exports to penalize Japan forbreaking a 1986 pact governing trade in semiconductors.    The United States says the Japanese have not lived up totheir pledge to stop dumping semiconductors in third countrymarkets at less than production costs or to open their homemarket to U.S. semiconductors. Semiconductors - tiny siliconmemory chips - are integral components of modern electronicgoods ranging from television sets and personal computers toguidance systems on aircraft.    Some U.S. officials had hinted that the United States andJapan might come to terms on their semiconductor dispute intime to cancel the planned tariffs, but this has now beendismissed by other senior officials.    They noted that negotiations over compliance with the pacthad been going on for several months, with little success.    Japanese firms this week announced plans to cut chip outputand increase U.S. chip imports, but U.S. officials said Japan'smove was too late to stave off the American tariffs.    The tariffs are to be imposed after a period of publiccomment, but Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and otherofficials have said neither the comment period or the U.S. andJapanese trade talks will serve to delay the tariffs.    Baldrige predicted the dispute would be resolved, but said"I'm sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out."    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that while hehoped something could be done to hold off the sanctions, "itprobably is not likely."    And U.S. Trade Represenative Clayton Yeutter predicted thatJapan would not be able to comply with the pact in time to holdoff the new tariffs on goods including personal computers,television sets, power tools and electric motors.    Trade analysts said that in any case, the U.S.-Japanesesemiconductor dispute was only one of many and trade frictionsthat will continue until Japan ended a policy of predatorypricing and opened its home market to foreign goods.    Other disputes include Japanese prevention of U.S. firmsfrom taking part in building a new eight billion dlr airportnear Osaka and selling a wide variety of goods in Japan,including many agriculture products.    A new trade row has now arisen over a Japanese decision tolimit foreign participation in its telecommunication market.    U.S. officials have said the American telecommunicationsmarket is open to foreign firms and it was only fair trade toopen the Japanese market to 33 per cent foreign participation,as Japan had previously agreed.    Britain has also protested the Japanese limitations.    American and Japanese negotiators are meeting to try toresolve the issue, officials said, but there was no sign of anyearly settlement.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial andlegal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IVoffer, which it said it considers inadequate.    The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by anothercompany, Conrac said.    Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives atspecial meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision onwhether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on "thefuture actions of Mark IV" and its unsolicitied tender offer.

Board members were also instructed to keep confidential theterms of any transaction that might be entered into until itbecomes final, the company said.    The board also took other defensive steps, includinggranting severance agreements to some officers, it said.    At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted aprovision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of allclasses of its voting stock to call a special shareholdersmeeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders toremove directors without cause, the company said.    The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said itplanned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at aspecial holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majorityof the company's common stock in the offer, Conrac said.    Conrac's president, vice president and treasurer were givenseverance agreements, or "golden parachutes," it said.

Producers met briefly today to exchange views on the marketsituation but there seems little chance discussion on quotaswill begin much before the ICO's annual council session inSeptember, they said.    Delegates earlier thought the meeting would end tonight,but a further session is scheduled tomorrow at 1030 GMT tocomplete reports on stock verification.    Meantime, the executive board will meet May 12 to discusspossible action on the consultancy report on the ICO presentedtoday to the board, consumer delegates said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, U.S. FARM REORGANIZATIONS PROVING COSTLY - GAO, U.S. farmers who reorganize theiroperations to circumvent a cap on federal payments could add2.3 billion dlrs to the cost of the government's agriculturalprograms by 1989, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.    "We estimate that should the trend in farm reorganizationscontinue, reorganizations since 1984 could be adding almost 900mln dlrs annually to program costs by 1989," GAO SeniorAssociate Director Brian Crowley said.    "Cumulative costs for the six-year period, 1984 to 1989,could approach 2.3 billion dlrs," he said.    Between 1984 and 1986, reorganizations added almost 9,000new persons to U.S. Agriculture Department payment rolls,Crowley told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat,Soybeans and Feedgrains.    The GAO said at least part of the recent proliferation ofreorganizations was attributable to farmers' efforts to avoidpayment limits, although exactly how many subdivisions wereprompted by that concern were impossible to determine.    Crowley said the two areas of primary concern were theformation of corporations and the renting of farmland for cashby individuals, partnerships or joint ventures with a largenumber of participants.    Subcommittee Chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said evidencethat a "few bad apples" were using imaginative techniques toskirt the payment limit jeopardized the "political credibility"of U.S. farm programs.    Without elaborating, Glickman said the committee wouldconsider legislation to "ensure than no one is tarnishing thegood name and the political support and popular support whichAmerican agriculture so richly deserves."    To improve the effectiveness of payment caps, Congresscould require that payments made to corporations, limitedpartnerships or trusts be attributed to the individual paymentlimitation of persons who are shareholders, members orbeneficiaries of those entities, Crowley said.    "Attribution could be made at some specified level ofownership interest such as five or ten pct," Crowley said.    Currently, such entities qualify for an individual 50,000dlr payment as long as no stockholder owns or controls morethan 50 pct of the stock.    Crowley also suggested that payments could be restricted topersons actively engaged in farming in some manner other thanjust supplying financing.    The Reagan administration proposed similar changes inlegislation it sent to Congress last month.    Crowley said the GAO investigation uncovered problems withUSDA's administration of the payment limitation thatcontributed to "the creation of new persons throughreorganization that are of questionable validity."    Specifically, USDA county offices have inconsistentlyapplied a regulation requiring a reorganization to involve a"substantive" change in the farming operation in order for anynew persons to qualify for payments.    In addition, GAO found USDA officials in California wereincorrectly interpreting regulations relating to financing ofgeneral partnership operations.    Crowley also reported that in 401 U.S. counties havingabout 90 pct of all foreign-owned cropland for all major crops,total farm payments to foreign owners were 6.2 mln dlrs in 1984and 7.7 mln in 1985.    However, payments in 1985 represented only about 0.4 pct ofall payments made in the 401 counties, he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP, Fresh, heavy rains caused furtherdamage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the weekto yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, tradesources said.    They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum cropswere damaged and yield estimates affected. New productionforecasts were made for all these crops.    The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registeredmore than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires andworsened the flooding in various parts of the province.    The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aireshave surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.    The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.    In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres areabordering on Uruguay.    In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mmin places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.    The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.    Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also befurther delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.    The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of thecrops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.    Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa andBuenos Aires provinces.    The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has beenlowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lowerthan the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.    The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.    The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of thearea sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Itwill begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weatherpermitting.    Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mlntonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which privateproducers put 1985/86 production.    The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the officialfigure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.    The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers'targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.    The production forecast was reduced to between three and3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.    The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mlnhectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.    The forecast for soybean yield this season was the leastchanged in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.    These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season'srecord of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.    The adjustment to the production forecast is due to therains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced thesunlight needed for this crop, sources said.    Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted downfurther.    The humidity could induce rotting and growers are stillfinding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlierin the season.    Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southernCordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, AUSTRALIA STOCK EXCHANGES ENTER NEW ERA, The Australian Stock Exchange Ltd (ASX)today took up the responsibility for administering a newcoordinated market made up of Australia's six former exchanges,now operating as subsidiary trading floors.    At the same time, rules prohibiting corporations andnon-stock-exchange members from holding more than 50 pct ofAustralia's 101 brokerage firms were abolished, leaving brokersexposed to greater deregulation.    Industry sources said the moves will smooth the changeoverto screen-based trading and give the equities market one voice.    Westpac Banking Corp &lt;WSTP.S> was one of the first to takeadvantage of the changes by announcing today it would doubleits stake in the Sydney firm &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd> to 100 pct.    Brokers have been introduced to creeping deregulation overthe past three years after legislation passed in 1984 to endrestrictive trade practices forced the traditional partnershipsto open themselves at first to partial ownership by outsideinstitutions, and eventually to full ownership.    The phase-in period has ended, and several major banks andoffshore financial institutions are investigating taking largerstakes in Australian broking houses, industry sources said.    Though deregulation was all but forced on brokers, most nowacknowledge that the influx of capital and contacts fromnon-member shareholders has benefited the industry, they said.    "Deregulation has brought an infusion of additional capitaland a broader base of products," ASX chairman Ian Roach toldReuters.    Roach said fears that major bank shareholders would imposea restrictive and conservative "bank culture" on the dynamicsharebroking industry were unfounded.    "So far the banks have been mindful of the importance ofpreserving the entrepreneurial aspect of sharebroking," he said.    But some brokers said others are sceptical and expect thatthe expiration of "golden handcuff" pacts, which tied partners totheir firms for a period after incorporation, could cause amassive talent drain.    Several leading brokers have already announced plans toleave their firms and establish new private client businesses,while others plan public floats.    While bank shareholders have enjoyed dabbling in brokingduring Australia's record two-and-a-half year bull run, theycould find themselves without the expertise they need duringmore difficult times, some brokers said.    Rene Rivkin, head of Sydney brokerage house &lt;Rivkin JamesCapel Ltd>, said many brokers will resist anything thatrestricts their individuality and entrepreneurial spirit, andthis could leave new entrants into the business short-staffed.    "If I were a bank I'm not sure I would have gone intobroking.... What's going to happen when a lot of these goldenhandcuffs come to an end?" Rivkin said.    "Only then will the banks know what they've got," he said.    Rivkin's firm is 50 pct owned by Hongkong and ShanghaiBanking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK> unit &lt;Wardley Australia Ltd> and plans apublic float of between 25 and 30 pct.    "My relationship with the Hong Kong bank is wonderful. Theyleave me alone and give me all the support I need.... Maybe ifwe weren't doing so well there wouldn't be that support, butthat hasn't happened," he said.    Other firms might not be so lucky, he said, and they couldfind it difficult to preserve their independence when the bullmarket ends.    In the last two years, the value of the Australiansharemarket has leapt 118 pct with turnover value up 152 pct to31.24 billion dlrs in the year to June 30, 1986.    That growth put existing trading systems and clearinghouses under pressure, and unification of the six sovereignexchanges should accelerate the development of screen-basedtrading and a single clearing house, industry sources said.    From July this year 30 leading stocks will be traded in apilot of the ASX's screen trading system which, depending onits reception by brokers, is expected to replace trading floorsover the next four years, industry sources said.

reut2-012.sgm, WALL STREET STOCKS/PACIFIC GAS &lt;PCG>, Pacific Gas and Electric Co's planto change its accounting methods for nuclear plant revenues,together with the prospect of higher higher domestic interestrates, helped push the company's stock price down 2-1/8 to 22,utility analysts and company executives said.    Pacific Gas said yesterday that a change in the method foraccounting for its Diablo Canyon Nuclear power plant revenueswill result in a 470 mln dlr reduction in 1987 earnings.    The company also said it intends to continue paying itscommon stock dividend at the current annual rate of 1.92 dlrsper share.    But the move also means that the company is not likely toincrease its dividend for perhaps as long as three years, saidMark Luftig, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.    "Anybody looking for a dividend increase has beendissapointed (by the announcement)," Luftig said.    Pacific Gas has raised its common stock dividend on aregular basis for the past 10 years, a company spokeswomansaid.    In addition, she also pointed out that prospects for higherinterest rates may also be affecting Pacific Gas tradingactivity.    Citicorp &lt;CCI> and Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> yesterdayincreased their prime lending rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2pct. It was the first rate increase by the big banks in nearlythree years.    Utility earnings are sensitive to interest rate increasesbecause of the high levels of borrowings needed to financeongoing construction projects.    Despite the market reaction, First Boston Corp analystArlene Barnes applauded the Pacific Gas decision.    "This is a very prudent move on management's part," saidBarnes.    Rather than using accounting tools to reflect income it isnot taking in, the company will now account for only the 40 pctof the cost of owning and operating the plant that regulatorsare allowing in the form of interim rate relief, Barnes said.    Pacific Gas had been carrying the other 60 pct as adeferred cash receivable and accounted for the non-cash item asincome.    "They'll take the hit this year, but at least we'll belooking at an honest earnings picture," Barnes also said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, U.S.-JAPAN TALKS SEEN NO DELAY TO TARIFFS, President Reagan's move to imposestiff tariffs on Japanese goods stems from deep U.S.frustration over Japan's trade policy, and he has no intentionof calling off the sanctions, trade analysts said.    U.S. officials put down any idea of delaying imposing the300 mln dlrs in tariffs, despite seemingly contradictorycomments by some Administration aides.    A visit here next week by Japanese trade officials and avisit to Tokyo by a senior State Department official willlikely do nothing to change the U.S. decision, they added.    "Do not expect the problem to be resolved or the sanctionsnot to go into effect," said a senior U.S. trade official.    Reagan last Friday announced that on April 17 he wouldraise tariffs on certain Japanese exports to penalize Japan forbreaking a 1986 pact governing trade in semiconductors.    Some U.S. officials had hinted the United States and Japanmight settle their dispute in time to hold off the tariffs, butthis has now been dismissed by other senior officials.    They noted that negotiations over compliance with the pacthad been going on for several months, with little success.    Japanese firms this week announced plans to cut chip outputand increase U.S. chip imports, but U.S. officials said Japan'smove was too late to stave off the American tariffs.    The tariffs are to be imposed after a period of publiccomment, but Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said anysettlement would probably come too late to delay the tariffs.    U.S. Trade Represenative Clayton Yeutter predicted Japanwould not be able to comply with the pact in time to hold offthe new tariffs on goods including personal computers,television sets, power tools and electric motors.    Trade analysts said that in any case the U.S.-Japanesesemiconductor dispute was only one of many, and trade frictionswill continue until Japan ended a policy of predatory pricingand opened its home market to foreign goods.    Other disputes include Japanese prevention of U.S. firmsfrom taking part in building a new eight billion dlr airportnear Osaka and selling a wide variety of goods in Japan,including an array of agricultural products.    A new row has now arisen over Japan's decision to severelylimit foreign participation in its telecommunication market.    U.S. officials have said the American telecommunicationsmarket is open to foreign firms and it was only fair trade toopen the Japanese market to 33 pct foreign participation, asJapan had previously agreed.    Britain has also protested the Japanese limitations. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER &lt;PCC>, Emery Air Freight Corp topped aleveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offermay surface.    Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 overEmery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per shareor 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc.    Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer forPurolator exceeded their expectations.    Several analysts previously had said they saw takeovervalues for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per sharerange. At least one, however, estimated the company could betaken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share.    Analysts today would not venture to say whether anotheroffer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to thebelief that the bidding could go higher.    "They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.Emery has shown the courage to go forth," said one arbitrager,who speculated other courier companies may also emerge asbidders.    "It makes sense," said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.But "It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a100 pct of the synergies."    Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings inthe short term, but long term, after eliminating redundanciesand selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery'sprofitability.    Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rivalUnited Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. packagedelivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX>, which has 47pct of the market.    Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator wouldhave about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr deliverybusiness.    "This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight(delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,"said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co.    Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, andits chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call.    E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period onits offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST.    One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likelyHutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical acompany outside the package delivery industry would want tooutbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company.    Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by someof its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH> subsidiary,speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come.    The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolatorboard member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said hebelieved a better offer could be made by another entity.    A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director hadno contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers linedup for Purolator.    Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into questionby a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attemptedto stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday.    Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer couldbe bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning tokeep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279mln dlr "bridge" loan that would later be replaced with otherdebt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator.    Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk nits investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its279 mln dlr loan.    Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mlndlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs inrevenues. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER, New York coffee futures prices willprobably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before aconsolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts.    Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after theInternational Coffee Organization did not place new exportquota discussions on its current agenda.    Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after fiveyears of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February.    "Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents,perhaps 85 cents," said William O'Neill, coffee analyst withElders Futures. "But the additional downside may not be allthat great from current levels."    "At this price level the market is very vulnerable tobullish developments," O'Neill added. "Rather than us having amarket that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode --probably to around 85 cents."    "I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a briefdrop to 85 cents," said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst withPrudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freezein Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor,with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.    A trader at a major international trade house, who askednot to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term butbelieves if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively highexport price and requires a high contribution quota fromexporters the market could steady at the lower levels.    Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount onBrazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a newinternational agreement could come into force next fall.    Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallenfrom about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lbtoday, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply anddemand.    Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup ofstocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and willneed to do some buying soon.    "Most producing nations have just completed or are about tocomplete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are attheir seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago andwarehouses in producer nations are becoming increasinglyoverburdened," said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for ShearsonLehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.    Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency toservice foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell,and "this should keep substantial pressure on exporters toundertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows."    Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb beforeBrazil's frost season begins in June.    Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by,though analysts note the peak winter consumption period ispassed and demand usually slows this time of year.    Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as ofJanuary 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bagscompared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdownfor the usually busy winter roasting season.    But Elders O'Neill said, "The roasters are not overstockedby any means."    Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult,given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territorybelow the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and severaltraders said the sidelines might be preferable for the shortterm. Reuter&#3;
reut2-012.sgm, ENERGY/U.S. REFINING, U.S. refiners said they are worriedthat growing supplies of imports, proposed federalenvironmental regulations, and the marketing of a third gradeof unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time whenthe industry is recovering from a recent slump.     "We have to look at national security and cut the amountof products and crude coming into the country if it hurts theindustry," said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleumproducts at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD).    U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S.consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid1990s, according to the Department of Energy.    "Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oilrequirements 15 or so years from now?" asked John Swearingen,chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp &lt;CIL> andformer chief executive of Amoco Corp &lt;AN>. "If your answer tothat question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all thatwe can now to cope with this situation and improve ourposition."    But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, aview echoed by others attending this week's National PetroleumRefiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas.    "Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouragingbecause those things won't solve our problems and could wellcompound them," said Swearingen. "Once the government affectsvalues, once an import quota or license has value, it's goingto be subverted by government," he added.     William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs ofan import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as EnergySecretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits toencourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He alsosaid altnerative energy sources should be encouraged.     Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pctdeduction from the taxable income of oil companies is controversal but might work, said Dunham.    Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oilimports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude andproduct imports.    "Why would companies import crude when they could importproducts for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?"asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum&lt;CNP>.     An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemicalproducts and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunhamsaid.     "The energy security issue should be considered whenenvironmental issues are considered," Martin said.    "The level of investment for the proposed lowering ofsulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, isunacceptable," Dunham said. "Most companies cannot afford it."    George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said theseproposals "will place pressure on small refining operations andpromote further industry consolidation."     An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released atthe conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pctweight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highwaydiesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs.     The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while theaverage aromatics content was 32 pct.     Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading offacilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline whichis beginning to be marketed by some companies.    "What will be the standard octane level in various gradesof unleaded gasoline?" asked Dunham. "A midlevel grade ofunleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means aninvestment has to be made," Dunham said.     This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg.     Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins tomove higher in the next few months.     "We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,"said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketingcompany that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA>.

reut2-012.sgm, ANALYSTS SAY USSR MAY PREFER NEW CROP U.S. WHEAT, The Soviet Union would likely be moreinterested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking anygrain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S.wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.    Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchasesuntil the condition of winter and spring crops is better knownmake new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman,director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.    "Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offereda subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respondto," Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusinesseducation conference here. But if there are too manyconstraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take lessthan an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.    Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put SovietUnion wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidyoffer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels,Moscow would likely buy more, he said.    "If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, Iexpect they'll take it," said Vernon McMinimy, director ofcommodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.    McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact oncrops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under asubsidy offer.    Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start becauseof a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter"they probably have had more damage due to winter weather thannormal," McMinimy said.

"If we can get the price up to the value of the company, wewill not be vulnerable to takeover pressure," said CharlesBlackburn, Diamond Shamrock's president and soon to be chiefexecutive officer of the new exploration and producing companywhose name has not yet been decided. He was visiting New Yorkfor talks with investors.    After successfully countering a takeover bid launched by T.Boone pickens in January, Diamond Shamrock said it wouldspinoff its refining and marketing operation into DiamondShamrock Refining and Marketing Co before its April 30 annualmeeting.    Blackburn told Reuters, "Our advisors told us that a splitwould give a better share value to investors and that themarket would give better multiples for pure refining andmarketing and exploration and production plays."    The two companies are now in the process of organizingthemselves to become "pure plays," the executives said.    Blackburn said the new company would be a pure explorationand production operation and that he was looking to divestnon-oil and gas operations, particularly Diamond Shamrock'scoal operations.    Blackburn said that "we are in talks about coal operationsbut I cannot discuss this further at this time."    He said the company would have a debt-to-capital ratio ofabout 38 pct, which could be paid down over time.    Blackburn said the company would seek to generate furtherinternal savings from rationalizing operations and personnelreductions. He has set a goal of 73 mln dlrs in internalsavings and "we need to get at least 20 mln dlrs of that savingsin 1987," Blackburn said.    "I would rather describe this as savings coming fromeliminating non-essential activities as we purify theexploration and production business."    "There are some people associated with those activities butit is more a matter of cutting and trimming rather thanwholesale changes," Blackburn said.    Blackburn intends to run a tight ship in which dividendswill not initially be paid and the resultant savings investedinto exploration and production.    "Our goal is to find 20 mln barrels a year in the U.S. toreplace our production and I think that we can do this at thelevel we intend to spend," Blackburn said.    "It might be more difficult to find more oil and more oilinternationally at these levels," he added.    Blackburn said that his new company would spend 75 mln dlrsin North America and 90 mln dlrs overseas, mainly Indonesia, inthe search for oil and gas reserves.    In 1986 Diamond Shamrock produced 82,473 mln barrels a dayof oil with 83 pct of that from Indonesia, while gas output was265.6 mln cubic feet a day of which 98 pct was in the U.S.    Blackburn said that he believed he could find oil toreplace this production at low costs which were 4.97 dlrs abarrel worldwide and 3.88 dlrs a barrel in the U.S..    Blackburn also said that the company would be willing tobuy reserves, "if we can find the right producing properties atthe right price".    Blackburn estimated that oil prices will average about 18dlrs a barrel this year with average prices received fornatural gas at 1.57 dlrs per thousand cubic feet.    Blackburn said he currently estimates that at thee pricesfor its products the company will have a cash flow of about 280mln dlrs.    "This will mean a net negative cash flow as we pretty muchspend our cash flow to find more oil and gas."    Blackburn said the company will search for both oil and gas"almost exclusively in estasblished basins".    Roger Hemminghaus, who will be chairman of the new DiamondShamrock Refining and Marketing Co, which last year had salesof approximately 1.6 billion dlrs, told Reuters his company wastaking on some debt.    "We are taking on some 400 mln dlrs new debt with three tierfinancing emphasizing a revolving loan, some term loans andsome unsecured private placement and are now in the latterstages of signing an agreement."    Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL> is the company's lead bankeron the loan, Hemminghaus said.    That debt will set the company off at a 60 pct debt-to-capital-ratio, which Hemminghaus said "is too much. Toalleviate that we will hold our capital expenditures down andpay down debt so that at the end of two years that ratio willbe reduced to mid 40 pct range."    Hemminghhaus said that cash flow will be "plus or minusabout 100 mln dlrs a year from earnings and depreciation."    In terms of major projects, Hemminghaus said that capitalexpenditures will be 35 mln dlrs to 50 mln dlrs spread over allof the company's projects.    Its major project will be a two year upgrading project onits McKee reinery in the Panhandle at 90,000 bpd ratedcapacity.

reut2-012.sgm, TALKING POINT/DOME PETROLEUM &lt;DMP>, Dome Petroleum Ltd's loss of 2.20billion dlrs, believed to be the biggest ever by a Canadiancompany, will have little impact on daily operations but willpressure creditors to accept a proposal to restructure Dome'sdebt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs, industry analysts said.    "Essentially what it (Dome's loss) does is put more focus onthe importance of the restructuring and puts more pressure oncreditors to agree to the debt rescheduling," said an oilanalyst who asked that he not be identified.    Dome reported earnings yesterday.    Analysts said the huge loss improves the appeal of a debtaccord by underlining company statements that creditors wouldreceive little or nothing under a forced liquidation that couldtake several years to complete.    After several months of negotiations with a group of 56major creditors and other unsecured public debt holders, Domesubmitted a complex proposal earlier this month that includesconverting debt to equity and extending repayment time.    "They've had their talks and now they have the proposal, sothe banks have to decide whether to accept the restructuring orpull the plug," the analyst said.    He and others said the huge loss, including writedownstotalling 2.08 billion dlrs before a 571 mln dlr reduction indeferred income taxes, dramatically enforces the company'sclaim that a 50 pct drop in world oil prices has crippled itsfinancial position.    But analysts said the writedown only impacts Dome's balancesheet and does not hurt the company's cash position.    "To a large extent, these writeoffs of the carrying value ofassets is really just the bookkeepers catching up to what thestock market has been telling us for a long time, reflectingthe collapse in oil prices," Peters and Co Ltd analyst WilfGobert said.    Dome reported it took a 1.20 billion charge in the fourthquarter, before a 305 mln dlr reduction in deferred incometaxes, for the decline in value of Dome's oil and gasproperties.    The extraordinary loss conformed with new CanadianInstitute of Chartered Accountants guidelines that require Dometo use average 1986 oil prices to value its holdings, insteadof an escalating price method used in prior years.    Analysts said six individual Swiss noteholders, whoinitiated legal action against Dome to recover debt of 408,500dlrs, will also be pressed to adopt a more lenient stand by the1986 results.    "To the extent that individuals were not fully accepting orcognizant of the seriousness of Dome's financial position, thefinancial statements reflecting this writedown of the value ofassets is certainly going to indicate the depth of thehemorrhaging that has taken place," Gobert said.    The legal action now before Swiss courts threatens totrigger cross-defaults on all of Dome's debt, toppling thedelicate debt negotiations. Dome is next scheduled to appearApril six to defend against the action.    First Marathon Securities Ltd analyst Rick Hallisey saidthe size of the loss was slightly larger than industryestimates of Dome's negative net worth, ranging between 1.50billion and two billion dlrs.    "What this writedown says is that a lot of the money thatwas spent in the past is unrecoverable, but the shareholdershave already recognized that through the writedown in the stockprice," Gobert said, adding, "The financial statements have comeout and said that what has happened in the past has been adisaster for Dome," Gobert added.    The price of Dome common shares fell five cts to 1.05 dlrsin trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange today. At the heightof Dome's success in 1981, common traded at about 25 dlrs ashare. Reuter&#3;

As a result, the bank's net income for the first quarterwill be reduced by about 40 mln dlrs. If Brazil's suspension ofinterest payments remains in effect, earnings for the wholeyear will be reduced by a further 100 mln dlrs.    BankAmerica said, however, that it expects to report aprofit for the first quarter of 1987.    BankAmerica also said that it had placed 180 mln dlrs ofloans to Ecuador on non-accrual, which will reducefirst-quarter earnings by about five mln dlrs.    If no interest payments are received for the rest of theyear from Ecuador, which is recovering from a severeearthquake, 1987 earnings will be cut by a further 10 mln dlrs.    But, "barring substantialy increased instabilities indeveloping countries," BankAmerica said it continues toanticipate an operating profit in 1987.    In the first quarter of 1986 BankAmerica earned a profit of63 mln dlrs but turned in a loss of 518 mln dlrs for the yearas a whole.    BankAmerica also said it completed yesterday the previouslyannounced sale of its discount brokerage subsidiary, CharlesSchwab Corp. The sale was part of a program of asset disposalsundertaken to staunch losses at the nation's second largestbank holding company.    BankAmerica stressed that it expects Brazil will eventuallyreach a debt rescheduling agreement which will provide for thepayment of interest being deferred in 1987.    "Negotiations will be complicated and lengthy, but wecontinue to expect that a rescheduling agreement will becompleted this year," said A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica's chairmanand chief executive officer.    "For the interim period, however, we concluded that theresponsible procedure would be to record income only as wereceive payments on the loans," he added in a statement.    U.S. banks are not legally required to place loans onnon-accrual until interest becomes more than 90 days overdue.    By striking accrued, but unpaid, interest from theiraccounts earlier than necessary, the banks are signalling toBrazil their readiness to dig in for a long fight over theterms of the rescheduling agreement regardless of theshort-term earnings impact, banking analysts said.    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofits 109 billion dlr foreign debt in February, citing a drop inofficial reserves, and said interest payments would be held ondeposit at the central bank pending a rescheduling.

A committee of the National Association of BroadcastEmployees and Technicians discussed the offer but after threehours they had not come to any decision.    If the union walks out it would mean simultaneous strikesagainst all three major U.S. television networks. A differentunion struck CBS Inc &lt;CBS> and Capital Cities/ABC Inc &lt;CCB> amonth ago. NBC is owned by the General Electric Co &lt;GE>.    "We're instructing all our members to continue workingwithout a contract," said John Krieger, a union official. Thecontract expired at midnight March 31.    Krieger said the committee is empowered to call a strike ifit sees fit but he added, "we're not gun shy and we're notstrike-happy, we don't take it lightly." He said the unionneeded time to draft a formal response to the NBC proposal,which the network billed as its "best and final offer."    A spokeswoman for NBC said management personnel wereprepared to take assume technical duties if its radio andtelevision facilities are struck.    "If there were a strike, we would not expect anyinterruption in our service," the NBC spokeswoman said. At CBSand ABC, where the Writers Guild of America has been on strikesince early March, viewers have noticed little difference inthe programs. However technicians are not involved in thewalkout at CBS and ABC.    Krieger said the "major stumbling block" in the talks withNBC was the network's insistence on having the right to hireengineers and writers on a daily basis. "In a broad sense thiswould decimate the union," he said, with temporary workersjeopardizing the jobs of staff employees.    NBC said its proposal "contains assurances that there is nointention to replace regular employees with daily hires." NBCsaid regular employees who may be on layoff would be offeredemployment first.    NBC also said any daily hires would be represented by theunion and would be phased in at four pct of regular staff inthe first year of a contract and six percent afterward.    Top scale wages would increase to 855 dlrs per week in thefirst year of the two-year contract and 895 dlrs in the secondyear, under the NBC proposal. Krieger said the network's wageproposals were "disappointing" but not the main issue.    NBC said its proposals would give it greater flexibility insports and news coverage. It said its proposals would permitlimited access to news materials from affiliates andsubscription services and allow Cable News Network to joinnetwork pool facilities. Cable News Network is owned by TurnerBroadcasting System &lt;TBS>.    Material from subscription servoces would be limited to anaverage of about one minute in a half-hour program, NBC said.The network said the changes it seeks "would reduce costlyduplication and are vital to NBC's long term health."    The major U.S. networks have experienced cost cuttingcampaigns following a series of ownership changes that affectedthe parent companies of all three in the past two years.    Laurence Tisch became the largest shareholder in CBS, NBC'sformer parent RCA was acquired by General Electric and ABC wasmerged into Capital Cities Broadcasting.    The broadcast operations have been hit with layoffs andother belt-tightening measures. Network executives cited cabletelevision services and video cassette players which competefor viewers.

reut2-012.sgm, FURTHER DECLINES IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES POSSIBLE, After an already steep fall in the pastweek, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declinesin the near term, financial analysts said.    However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bondfutures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and thecontracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery beforeresuming their decline.    Key to the near-term direction of futures will be thecourse of the dollar, they said.    "As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market," said DeanWitter analyst Karen Gibbs.    The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year lowagainst the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday whenseveral large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised theirprime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.    "Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar declineis over," Gibbs said.    The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debtfutures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.    Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at themeeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the FederalOpen Market Committee, this week, analysts said.    "To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, asteepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices looksuspiciously like the traces of expectations of acceleratinginflation," said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEnteeand McGinley Inc.    Such expectations could mean that "a shift in policy towardrestriction of bank reserves is likely to get very seriousconsideration," at the FOMC meeting, he said.    Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highlyvisible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said.    Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found inseasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, hesaid. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mlndlrs over the past several months, he said.    In the meantime, however, "the market looks a bitoversold," said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.    Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition coulddrive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to testchart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.    Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Bostonsaid that the key test for June bonds will be whether thenearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.    "All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped andbuyers have surfaced at that level," Keefe said.    If that level is broken, and the dollar continues todecline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract todecline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrendline dating back to 1984.

reut2-012.sgm, U.S. HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP, URGES USSR OFFER, The U.S. House Agriculture Committeeapproved proposals to extend the life of the Export EnhancementProgram, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reaganadministration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.    The proposals were approved as amendments to acomprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.    In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committeeapproved several proposals which could restrict imports oflamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Thoseamendments affecting imports face an uncertain future becausethe House Ways and Means Committee, which has overalljurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,Congressional sources said.    The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend thelife of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather thanthe current three years through fiscal 1988.    The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., alsowould increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from1.5 billion now.    Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered byRep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Departmentto value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisitionvalue. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pctless expensive to operate.    The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered byRep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administrationmake an offer, but urges such action.    The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. GlennEnglish, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture tobegin discussions with other major grain producing countriesaimed at jointly reducing world grain production.    Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed theamendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.    Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approvedby the panel, the most significant would require quotas onimports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farmproduct that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offeredby Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily atcurbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar andforeign foods containing dairy products. It also may affectpeanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.    Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports ofcasein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by NewZealand and Ireland.    The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the samecountercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.beef imports.    Other miscellaneous amendments included:    -- Urging the administration consider retaliating againstJapan and South Korea if those countries do not removerestrictions on beef imports.    -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shippedeach year under a food aid program called Section 416 to800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.    -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study ofthe Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat todetermine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.    -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse theNational Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for thecosts of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against aCanadian countervailing duty case this year.    -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decisionto apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by theEuropean Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.    -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a NationalCommission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended areorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.

reut2-012.sgm, DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987, Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has seen aslow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986,management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.    Credit business declined in the first few weeks of theyear, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weakGerman bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, andtrading in securities also fell. But earnings from currencydealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.    Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balancesheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.    Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of theformer Flick group, which have been estimated at some onebillion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank'sown account, not included in partial operating profits.    Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through asubsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interestsurplus in a section current earnings from securities andparticipations.    In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from1.45 billion.    As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.    But it said that total operating profits, including ownaccount trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flicktransaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in theparent bank.    Banking analysts said this put group total operatingprofits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bankoperating profits at over five billion marks.    Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earningsfrom Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of itsunchanged 12 mark dividend.    The bank had decided against raising the dividend itselfbecause of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,and developments so far this year showed that was correct,Christians said.    West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they aresure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequentyears, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.    The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue ahigh level of risk provision, Christians said.    Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in1986 from 765 mln in 1985.    Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarilyreflect the full amount of risk provisions.    Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen saidDeutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallento over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985because of the fall in the dollar.    He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds ofsuch problem country debt had been written off.    Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of "othersecurities," to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in theparent bank.    Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly dueto its increased activity in international share placements,with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's internationalplacement last year remaining on its books.    Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned toplace these shares and conclude the original placement. Reuter&#3;

Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding fromDeutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal withCreditanstalt.    Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover ofLloyds Bank plc &lt;LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said.    Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recentcapital increase of &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had noplans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell.    &lt;Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct wasacquired from Bankamerica Corp &lt;BAC.N> late last year, would beconsolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion ofDeutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F.Wilhelm Christians said.    Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal HighCourt, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in thebalance sheet section "participations," Christians said.    But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in thesenon-bank companies as an investment rather than an activeparticipation.    Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marksin 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a riseto 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.

reut2-012.sgm, WORLD RECESSION UNLIKELY - DEUTSCHE'S HERRHAUSEN, A world recession is unlikely thisyear as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrializedcountries is supporting the economy, Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F>management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said.    But growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5to 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told anews conference.    Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption wouldsupport economic growth in West Germany this year, with netincome increases turning into purchasing power as long asinflation did not revive.    Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise inWest Germany this year, but there was little room for furtherfalls. Rates in the U.S. were however rising, as evidenced bythe latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate.    Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing ofthe U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months.    One success of the Paris agreement in February to fostercurrency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talkingdown the dollar, he noted.    The recent stability would last until markets decided totest the resolve of central banks, he said.    He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrsthis week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the firstsuch test.    "A massive attack on the mark, which could come if we getbad news out of the U.S., Would require a much higherintervention amount, raising the danger of inflation," he said.    Turning to the international debt problem, Herrhausen saidBrazil's unilateral debt moratorium had surprised banks.    But the move showed that a real solution to debt problemswas only possible with the involvement of all parties. Reuter&#3;
reut2-012.sgm, SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH, Singapore's major banks arediversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings fromloans to debt instruments, banking sources said.    The banks following the trend are the &lt;Overseas Union BankLtd>, &lt;United Overseas Bank Ltd>, &lt;Oversea-Chinese BankingCorporation> and the &lt;Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.    The shift towards securitisation has been helped byvolatile financial markets which have developed hedgingfacilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for riskmanagement, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.    Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks seelimited growth in credit risk. More and more of them areswitching from term lending to major growth areas such asstockbroking and fee based income, he said.    Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after beinggranted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are nowmoving into the new government securities market and the StockExchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.    One foreign banker said the Development Bank and theOverseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equitymarket in Singapore.    Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market hasincreased business transactions and provided long term growthfor the market. The banks are not competition for individualstockbroking firms because of the increased business theygenerate, he added.    Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expandequity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year becauseof the increasing ability of foreign and local marketparticipants to absorb new issues.    Loh said &lt;OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary ofthe Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm tolaunch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investorsseeking capital growth through a diversified internationalportfolio. It will invest in international shares with theemphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.    &lt;DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of theDevelopment Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong KongStock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.    Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates inSingapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will beforced to provide fund management services for major clientsseeking better returns, he said.    Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the majorbanks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income fromtreasury and investment banking activities.    They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chineseand United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pctagainst respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.    Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.    The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by&lt;National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiaryof the bank, they said.

Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue ifthere are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members whooffer higher prices than non-members, he said.

Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 theprevious year.    However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thaigovernment supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposedICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.

"By the end of this year, we should have an internationalprotocol in place we can all be proud of," U.S. Environmentalprotection agency officer Bill Long told reporters.    The chemicals are chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) whichare used in refrigeration and making foam plastics, solventsand aerosols.

The officials and scientists were meeting in Tokyo, aheadof an international conference on the problem later this monthin either Vienna, or Geneva, Long said.    Robert Watson, a program manager for atmospheric problemsat the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration saida protocol should demand an initial freeze on the use of CFCsby industry.

Stanley Katz said.    "We have very large projects in Indonesia and we would liketo accelerate their implementation," Katz told Reuters.    Indonesia is the largest recipient of ADB lending. Itreceived 118 loans worth 3.7 billion dlrs for 112 projectsbetween 1968 and 1986, 19.0 pct of the ADB's total lending.Ordinary capital resources (OCR) lending to Indonesia was 3.6billion dlrs, 27.1 pct of OCR loans at end-December 1986.    Jakarta has also received loans worth 162 mln dlrs from thebank's Asian Development Fund.    ADB sources said Indonesia's cumulative disbursements atend-1986 amounted to only 1.1 billion dlrs or 30 pct of loansreceived. "Project implementation is very slow in Indonesia andwe are not very satisfied with the pace. We hope the new officemight help," Gunther Schulz, ADB Vice-President in charge ofprojects, said.    Planned projects were further slowed down in 1986 becauseof the country's budgetary problems, he added. Indonesia'srevenue from oil exports was cut in half last year.    "Decision making is quite slow, complicated and verycentralised," Schulz told Reuters.    Indonesian President Suharto set up a high-level team inJuly last year to speed up projects using ADB funds.

reut2-012.sgm, GERMAN INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES 3.2 PCT IN FEBRUARY, West German industrial production,seasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in Februaryafter a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in January, theEconomics Ministry said.    The ministry had originally estimated that industrialproduction fell 3.0 pct in January.    The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by justunder one percentage point next month when the March figure isreleased, a ministry statement said.    The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at aprovisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the Januaryand December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.    In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.    The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pctincrease in construction output compared with January, whenproduction in many industrial sectors was depressed byunusually severe winter weather.    Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise inproduction in February compared with January. But energy sectoroutput fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.    The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to bea better guide to trends, said output in January and Februarytogether fell around two pct against November and December.    The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct inJanuary/February against November/December due to the coldJanuary weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct andmining output 10 pct.    Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct inJanuary/February compared with November/December.    Within this sector, the output of both basic products andof food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production ofcapital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods wasunchanged.    Compared with the same months of 1986, industrialproduction in January and February 1987 fell 1-1/2 pct, theministry said.    Manufacturing industry output fell one pct, with output ofbasic products down three pct, capital goods down one pct andfood, tobacco and alcohol production 1-1/2 pct lower. Makers ofconsumer goods posted a 1-1/2 pct year-on-year rise in thetwo-month period.    In other industrial sectors, mining production fell fourpct and construction output 4-1/2 pct.

reut2-012.sgm, C AND W OFFERED ROLE IN NEW JAPAN TELECOM COMPANY, A Japanese businessman announced plans fora new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable andWireless Plc would be a core company.    However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation ofEconomic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does notspecify what stake Cable and Wireless would have.    "The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,"Watanabe said in a statement. "The actual percentage ofshareholdings should be agreed by the core companies."    He said the eight core companies will provide directors forthe firm.    "The new company shall immediately set to work on thefeasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,"Watanabe said.    Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups,one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against&lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan'soverseas telephone business.    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wantsonly one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts.    A British source, who declined to be identified further,said the proposals could open the door to further talks betweenC and W &lt;CAWL.L> and the other firms involved.    C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal whichwould have given it a five pct share in the newtelecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pctstake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stakein one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge.    The British source said the decision not to specify theexact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the dooropen for further discussion.    "It's probably a sensible approach on their part," theBritish source told reuters.    C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay anew cable between Japan and the U.S.    The proposed merger has sparked an international row, withBritish government sources threatening retaliatory actionagainst Japan for what they see as discriminatory practicesagainst foreign firms.    The sources said last Friday that one option for Britainwould be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securitiescompanies operating in London.    The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans,saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.    Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms,Watanabe said, "They will not be core companies but if they wishthey could participate." Under the Japanese law, total foreignparticipation would be limited to one-third.    "It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which hasthe support of many influential backers and work within thisfor the realization of their ideas," Watanabe told reporters.    The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>, Mitsuiand Co &lt;MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp &lt;SUMT.T>, Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co &lt;MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co&lt;CITT.T>, and &lt;Pacific Telesis International Inc>.

reut2-012.sgm, AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS, Australia is risking wheat exportsales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meetbuyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.    "Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly qualityconscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual qualityspecifications," the board said in a submission to the RoyalCommission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.    "Many of the specifications are more specific than thecurrent categories used in Australia," it said.    The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costsand boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.    Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat marketshare because its competitors are supplying cheaper butlower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.    It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at everystage from receival to shipping.    Better industrial relations at grain terminals, moreuniform transport systems across the states and extensive stockcontrol were vital to improved marketing, it said.    The submission also said Australia's federal system impededthe AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing ofwheat.    The AWB called for an end to physical and legislativeconstraints at state borders that prevent the efficienttransport of grains to other states for shipment.    "It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic modeto the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state inwhich the wheat is grown or stored," it said.    For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW)might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than toSydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly,southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland orGeelong, in Victoria.    Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly overgrain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.    The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulkhandling authorities is not essential, although it said itfavoured the authorities maintaining at least their currentlevel of control of storage and transport as long as qualitywas maintained.    An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel atvarious Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houstonand 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

One Western diplomat said share issues are on thebackburner because they are ideologically too sensitive.    The People's Daily said last month that trading shares is"not compatible with socialist materialist civilisation."    The newly opened market traded bonds in four state-ownedfirms and buyers outnumbered sellers, the China Daily said.    China's first securities market since 1949 opened lastAugust in Shenyang, followed by markets in Shanghai inSeptember and in Peking and Harbin this year. They trade mostlybonds.    "Bonds are all right. There is no risk to the holder andthere is no question of his having any ownership stake in thefirm," the diplomat said.    The People's Daily article said joint stock companies mightnot be the way to reform large and medium-size state firms northe model for reforming China's ownership system.    Share issues would make the workers owning them think onlyof the economic advantage of their own firms, rather than thenation as a whole, the People's Daily said.    As late as December, officials were pushing the idea ofshare issues as a way to channel excess cash in the economyinto production, reduce the state's investment burden andmotivate share-owning employees to work harder.    In November, Liu Hongru, deputy governor of the People'sBank of China, told a delegation from the New York StockExchange that a long-term funds market should be built up, "withstocks and bonds issuance as the main form."    "Stocks and bonds should be issued through banks, trust andinvestment companies ... The transfer of securities should beconducted through financial institutions ... The opening up ofsecondary markets should be studied after trials andexperiments," Liu said.    The subject of share issues and trading was widely coveredin the official press last year, usually in a positive way.    One of the most far-reaching proposals came from a Pekinguniversity professor. He said all but essential state firmsshould become joint stock holding companies, with the stateholding a controlling share that could be as low as 33 pct.    The professor argued this would separate governmentadministrators from managers of the firms, a key goal ofChina's reforms. He said his plan would make the companiesindependent units under a board of directors.    The diplomat said the dropping of share issues may be theresult of conservative backlash since the January resignationof reformist Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang. He said shareissues raise sensitive questions: "What happens if the valuefalls? People are not used to this and may be dissatisfied.What happens if a person gets very rich through shareownership? The government does not want disparity in income."    One Chinese journalist said conditions are not ripe forwidespread share issues. "In China, the success or failure of afirm does not entirely lie within its own hands. There are manyexternal factors beyond its control," he said. "To make sharepurchasing attractive, you need a secondary market and perhapsspeculators," he said. "But speculation is not acceptable inChina."    Asked if there are political reasons for putting asideshare issues, he said that in China economics and politicscannot be separated.    "There is a very major review of the economic reforms goingon. There are political factors involved," the journalist said."If the economy runs well this year, the political pressure willbe less."    Comments by officials of the new Tianjin market echoed hiscaution. The China Daily quoted one official as saying Chinadoes not intend to develop stock exchanges equivalent to thosein the West while it has a socialist economic system. "Given thespecial circumstances of our country, we must approach the newphenomenon in a contemplative and comprehensive way so as toguide trading onto a healthy track," he said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-012.sgm, BAYER CONFIDENT OF POSTING GOOD 1987 RESULTS, Chemicals group BayerAG &lt;BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.    The company said that this was despite the mark's furtherstrengthening against the dollar and other currencies anddespite an increase in competitive pressure.    "The further progress of our business will depend largely onthe extent to which threats to free trade materialise and onthe developments of exchange rates, raw material and energycosts.    Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billionmarks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72billion from 1.62 billion.    The company gave no net profit figures or any indication ofthe likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985results, up one mark from a year earlier.    Bayer said that world group operating profit declinedslightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showeda further improvement.    Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainlythe sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.    Lower prices on the raw material side had also broughtpressure on selling prices, it added.    In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against1985, the company said without giving details.    "The western Europe, North America and Far East regionsdeveloped well in local currency, but here too the translationof local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,especially in the case of North America," it said.    Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.    Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combinedwith savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offsetfalling prices and cost increases in other areas.    The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lowerextraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating rawmaterials all developed well, it said.    Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that worldgroup turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last threemonths of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.    Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pctto 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower andforeign turnover 8.6 pct lower.    Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarteragainst 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985. REUTER&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, NEW SINGAPORE FINANCIAL MARKET SET TO OPEN, The new Singapore governmentsecurities market will start trading in late April or early Mayafter President Wee Kim Wee signs the Development Loan Billapproved by parliament last week, bankers said.    But the new market is unlikely to attract many overseasinvestors, particularly as non-residents will be subject to awithholding tax on interest earned, Loh Hoon Sun, generalmanager of &lt;Overseas Union Bank Ltd>, said.    Overseas Union Bank Ltd is one of the five primary dealersapproved to underwrite the auctions and ensure liquidity.    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which approvedthe five underwriters, aims to issue seven billion dlrs oftreasury bills, notes and bond issues in the first year.    A MAS spokesman said a steering committee has yet todetermine details, but most of the new government securitieswill have a maturity of up to five years and 10-year paper maybe issued if demand emerges. Bonds and treasury bills will beissued in denominations of 1,000 dlrs and treasury bills in aminimum denomination of 10,000 dlrs.    Bankers said these rates will put the securities withinreach of almost everyone and will create a more active market.    Allocations will be made first for non-competitive bidsfrom primary dealers prepared to accept average yields on up to500,000 dlrs worth of notes and bonds and an unlimited volumeof treasury bills. The remainder will be awarded to competitivebidders offering the lowest yields.    The new market should stimulate the local economy. Fundswill come from savings and fixed deposit accounts, "but just howmuch will depend on the bond yields," Loh told Reuters.    Loh said bank interest rates currently stand at 3.0 to 3.5pct for fixed deposits and the prime rate is 5.5 pct, and theserates are expected to remain fairly steady this year.    An act of parliament passed last week granted the Singaporeauthorities permission to raise 35 billion dlrs in the newmarket over the next four years.    Trading will be computerised and scripless.

Mwape said in a speech to businessmen in the southern townof Livingstone yesterday that the IMF's approach had causedsocial and political unrest across the continent.    There was widespread rioting and looting in Zambia lastDecember after the government abolished subsidies on refinedmaize meal in line with IMF recommendations.    Mwape said told businessmen "The question which should beasked and answered when designing programmes is who is going tobear the brunt of adjustment ... And what cushion is availableto minimise the burden ?"    Zambia has had five IMF adjustment programmes since 1976,the last of which was cancelled in February last year, he said."In spite of these, the economy has shown signs of stress, withno significant improvement in a number of areas," he added.    Zambia has just completed a new round of IMF talks on itsforeign exchange system and has obtained enough commercialloans to pay off its IMF arrears for 1985 and 1986, paving theway for a new stand-by credit.    Zambian politicians have frequently criticised the fund,however, and diplomats say President Kenneth Kaunda facesconsistent opposition inside the ruling party's centralcommittee over dealings with the IMF.

reut2-012.sgm, COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES, &lt;San Miguel Corp>, SMC, and &lt;UnitedCoconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on adisputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of agovernment panel that controls the sequestered shares said.    Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on GoodGovernment (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.    "It looks good," Diaz said. But he added several issues,including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares,had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to thesale.    The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares abortedSMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in theUCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares wereactually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate offormer President Ferdinand Marcos.    Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB whenhe fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.    "The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB areowned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers," Diaz said. "Naturally we donot want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies."    PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a downpayment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiaryNeptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.    The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would beforfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed tofulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originallynegotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.    PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food andbeverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln "B" class sharesfrom the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at aprice of 150 pesos per share.    The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion pesotransaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferredshares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollecteddividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced toUCPB-controlled trading companies.    The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per sharemade by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15pct stock dividend declared in June last year.    A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board mettoday to discuss the proposed compromise.    The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the boardmeeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.    President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB toset up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownershipissue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.    Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMCboard, filed a formal complaint before the Securities andExchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight otherdirectors of violating "fiduciary duty."    De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC'sboard last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan. REUTER&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, LAWSON REMARKS DASH HOPES OF EARLY U.K. RATE CUT, Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are preciseexchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling,dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analystssaid.    But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levelsindicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer termoutlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed.    In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy,Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting hewas comfortable with sterling exchange rates around currentlevels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.    Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterlingat about present levels, using currency intervention andinterest rates to achieve this.    The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five andCanada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed toinclude target ranges, but all participants to the meeting hadso far refused to specify these.    Markets were quick to react to the statement, choppingabout one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to matchthe levels mentioned by Lawson.    But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson'sstatement signalled a change in U.K. Policy.    Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capeland Co, said, "the remarks have been blown out of proportion.Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue."    Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, "there isnothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement."    He said he did not believe the rates indicated by theChancellor were precise targets, but merely represented centralrates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate,perhaps by as much as 10 pct.    "It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of anelection ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tiehimself to a fixed rate," Brett said.    Currency markets were keen for official statements toclarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currencytrading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.    "Making similar statements when the market is high strungand ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake," one senior dealerwith a U.S. Bank said.    Capel's Skeoch said, "it gives the foreign exchange marketssomething to shoot at."    "It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Groupof Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut instone, they can change with time," Skeoch said.    Brett said, "we think the 2.90 marks level is a centralrate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine."    Not all analysts played down the significance of theremarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank ofCanada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulatesterling from the fortunes of the dollar.    Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conductedwith European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowedthe dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.    "Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Orthrow in its lot with Europe," Dunn said.    "It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying tojoin the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection byshadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wantsthe U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark," he said.    Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets followingLawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Baserates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.    "Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get someextremely good economic indicators," Capel's Skeoch said.    Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March,the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analystshad been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards. REUTER&#3;

The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisationsofficial Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposalsmade earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press.    Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying tocompete against Japan's &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> whichmonopolises Japan's overseas telephone business.    But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger ofthe two consortia would be impracticable. "They are like oil andwater," he said.    The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and haveproposed that the two consortia band together. The issue hasbeen taken up by the British government as a test case on theopenness of Japanese markets. Watanabe's latest proposals saidthat the eight core companies of the new group should haveequal share holdings but added that they could work out theprecise percentages amongst themselves.    The reports earlier this week said that Cable would beoffered a five pct stake, up from an originally proposed threepct.    Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered, theCable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentiallythe same.    Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at374p.

The expenses will be chargedagainst fourth quarter results, it said.    The company said it has agreed as well to make complianceand public safety capital expenditures of about 600,000 dlrs.    It said it has now received an operating permit for a new250,000 cubic yard landfill cell at its Imperial County,Calif., from the Health Services department.    The company said the Panoche facility remains closed but isexpected to reopen for liquid and sludge receipts in the nearfuture.  But it said receipts of solid material, which hadaccounted for the majority of the revenue at the site, could berestricted until 1988 pending resolution of capacity issues inthe Panoche site permit.

reut2-012.sgm, WESTLB LUXEMBOURG REPORTS LOWER 1986 NET PROFIT, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale&lt;WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLBInternational SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.    WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend toWestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.    The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the recordprofit of the previous year could not be repeated, due tochanged market conditions, it said. Increased funds were alsoallocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of1987 developed positively, it added.    WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks forinternational credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in thebalance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.    Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mlnin 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact thatcredit business redemptions were not fully offset by newlending.    The statement said WestLB International's business withprivate customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.    This development was aided by cooperation between the bankand the savings banks in the West German state of NorthRhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.    Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of1.1 billion.    WestLB International said it plans to expand its range ofservices for private clients. REUTER&#3;

The company said the new PC's are compatible with mostexisting IBM PC applications.              The new computers, which mark the first major overhaul ofthe IBM PC line since the company entered the business in 1981,include a PC based on the Intel Corp &lt;INTC> 80386microprocessor, making it the most powerful IBM PC to date.    Also included is an Intel 8086 based system which IBM saidis up to two and a half times as fast as its IBM PC XT model.    IBM also introduced two new versions of its PC AT system.These use an Intel 80286 chip running at 50 pct faster than theexisting IBM PC AT.    The new line of PC's, which IBM calls the PersonalSystem/2, uses 3.5 inch diskettes instead of the conventional5.25 inch diskettes.    The company said the smaller diskettes store from two tofour times more data than larger diskette, which typicallyhandle 360 kilobytes of data.    IBM said the new PC AT's and the 80386-based PC use a newIBM-designed 32-bit data bus. This carries data internallywithin the PC.    The company said the new bus offers processing power up totwo to three-and-a-half times the existing IBM PC AT.    IBM said the new PC's can run a new operating system,called IBM DOS Version 3.3, which is now available.    The company also said it will offer a second operatingsystem, called IBM Operating System/2, developed jointly withMicrosoft Corp &lt;MSFT>. This will be available in stages,beginning in the first quarter of 1988.    IBM said Operating System/2 will for the first time giveIBM PC users the ability to access multiple applications andvery large programs and amounts of data.    IBM said said its Personal System/2 Model 30, which is anIntel 8-megahertz (MHz) 8086-based system, is now available ata list price of 1,695 dlrs each with two diskette drives andfor 2,295 dlrs with one diskette and one 20-megabyte fixed diskdrive. The unit weighs 17 pounds.    It said an 8087 math coprocessor that runs at the sameeight MHz rate as the 8086 is available.    The company said the Personal System/2 Model 50, an Intel10 MHz 80286-based desktop system, is now available at a costof 3,595 dlrs.    IBM said said its Personal System/2 Model 60, which is alsoan Intel 10 MHz 80286-based system, is a floor-standing systemavailable in two configurations. This system, which isscheduled for availability in the second quarter, lists at5,295 dlrs with a 44MB fixed disk drive and 6,295 dlrs on the70MB fixed disk drive.    The company said the Personal System/2 80 is the mostpowerful member of the new family of PC's, using an Intel80386-based mocroprocessor. The floor-standing machine will beavailable in three configurations.    IBM said one Model 80 configuration, scheduled for Julyavailability at a cost of 6,995 dlrs, runs at 16 MHz, contains1MB of memory and features a 44MB fixed disk drive.    A second configuration, also scheduled for July at 8,495dlrs each, runs at 16 MHz and has 2MB of memory and a 70MBfixed disk drive.    The company said the third Model 80 is scheduled for thefourth quarter and features IBM-designed one-megabit memorytechnology. Expected to cost 10,995 dlrs, it runs at 20 MHz andfeatures 2MB of memory and a 115 MB fixed disk drive.       IBM said its Personal System/2 incorporates enhancedintegrated graphics functions including significantly improvedtext, expanded colors up to 256 out of a palette of more than256,000, and sharper business graphics.

Although other firms have developed such superconductivematerials, Toshiba scientists said their discovery is the firstthat allows the material to be formed into a pliable wire.    Developing a superconducting material that works at roomtemperature with no resistance is the object of a freneticworldwide scientific race. The main applications would be insuper powerful magnets, small computers of immense power andspeed, electric transmission lines which use negligible power,and electric generators which consume no power.    Toshiba said that it will probably be five years before itcan incorporate superconductors in marketable machines.    But problems still have to be surmounted. Presentsuperconductors, including Toshiba's, need to be cooled to verylow temperatures before they can pass electricity with noresistance. This requires costly liguid gas coolants.

Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of SouthAfrican Trade Unions (COSATU), which claims a membership ofover 600,000 workers, most of whom are black, urged labourunions to show solidarity with the striking railwaymen, addingthat a key issue in the strike was the freedom of workers tojoin trade unions of their choice.    Naidoo criticised the government-run South AfricanTransport Services (SATS) for refusing to recognise the SouthAfrican Railway and Harbours Workers Union, which representsmost of the strikers.    He also accused SATS of applying "racist labour policies," bythreatening to replace the strikers and added that thecorporation's decision had further "inflamed the dispute."    The strike began on March 14 when workers walked outfollowing the railway company's refusal to go to formalarbitration talks over the dismissal of a train driver.    SATS says that some 13,000 workers are involved in thestoppage, but union leaders put the number of strikers closerto 18,000.    The Cosatu official said a number of its affiliate unionshad resolved to "take solidarity action" and would inform SouthAfrica's Labour Minister of their decision.

reut2-012.sgm, MELLON &lt;MEL> SEES LARGE FIRST-QUARTER LOSS, Mellon Bank Corp said it expectsto report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mlnto 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share.    The company also said it intends to reduce its secondquarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts.    Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in thefirst quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs incharge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-lossreserve.    It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cashbasis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs.    In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrsor 2.13 dlrs a share.    Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs andincreased provisions address four areas of concern in thebank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,developing countries, some basic industrial companies andseveral commercial real estate businesses.    Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the firstquarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct ofthe loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct oftotal loans at the end of 1986.    Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of thefirst quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines.    Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986.    Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement inenergy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lackof a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent toincrease reserves and take losses on loans in this sector.    "This action relates both to loans to companies directlyinvolved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers,home builders and financial institutions in the SouthwesternUnited States," Barnes said.    As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mlndlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but hadcharged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt.    He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quitBrazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term creditlines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil andother sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts.    Loans to basic industries were not major contributors tothe increase in non-performing assets or to first-quartercharge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about theabsence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries.    The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continuedmanagement cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon hasthe financial strength to deal with current uncertainties,Barnes said.    "We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presentlytrouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing themaggressively," he added. Reuter&#3;

West German economics researcher Jochen Bethkenhagen, in areport presented to a NATO economics seminar, said increasedtargets for Soviet nuclear energy output showed the April,1986, disaster had not caused any change in Moscow's energypolicy.    But the accident was expected to prompt design changes infuture Soviet power stations to "exclude manipulations of safetyequipment" of the sort that occurred at Chernobyl, he said.    This will presumably result in substantial delays in thecompletion of reactor blocks and in stricter quality controlsduring the construction of nuclear power stations, he said.    Bethkenhagen said the Chernobyl accident was also likely tohave frustrated for a long time Soviet hopes of exports ofnuclear power stations to countries outside the Comecon bloc.    "It is also doubtful that the talks with China, Syria, Libyaand Iraq with regard to Soviet deliveries in the next few yearswill have positive results," he said.    The meeting heard views of academics and Kremlin-watcherson the impact of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on energypolicy.    Several participants today argued that Gorbachev wasunlikely to extend his internal economic policies to the energysector, at least for now.    Bethkenhagen said high energy growth targets set by theSoviet Union up to the end of the decade showed Moscow intendedto stick to a rigid supply-, rather than demand-orientedpolicy.    Norwegian academics Arild Moe and Helge Ole Bergesen saidthat the Soviet fuel industries represented such a pillar ofthe economy that immediate reform was tricky.

In testimony to the economic commission of Congress, Rubiosaid the main measure of money supply, the broad-based LiquidAssets in Public Hands, grew at an estimated annualised rate of17 pct in March, the same as in February.    The bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year.    Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range.    He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was dueto a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pctreal drop in the contribution of the external sector.    The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but adrop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negativecomponent of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, U.S. URGED TO STRENGTHEN DEBT STRATEGY, Several industrial nations arepressing the United States to consider whether its debtstrategy, under increasing fire in the developing world, needsto be strengthened, monetary sources say.    While few nations are ready to pour vast sums of money intoradical "debt relief" style solutions to the debt crisis,pressure is building for a greater International Monetary Fundrole in the plan.    But U.S. officials, who are fighting off demands for changeby Congress, are confident they will retain support for theirstrategy which will probably be endorsed in a communiqueissued by the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee.    One Reagan administration official said a recent discussionamong leading industrial countries showed there was "very broadand strong support for continuing the strategy".    The official said in an interview, "I don't sense thatthere's a strong desire to revise the debt strategy, except ofcourse here on (Capitol) Hill."    But monetary sources said some industrial nations, likeFrance and Italy, are troubled by signs the strategy isincreasingly strained. Britain too is said to be concerned.    In late 1985, Washington called on multilateral developmentbanks, like the World Bank, and commercial banks to increaseloans to the 15 major debtors by 29 billion dlrs over threeyears.    In return, the major debtors were expected to undertakereforms promoting inflation-free economic growth, more openmarkets and a reduced government role in the economy.    The IMF was to retain a "central role" in the strategy,shifting its economic reform programs from emphasizingausterity to stressing growth, freer trade policies and foreigninvestment in debtor nations.    But monetary sources said some nations want even moreflexibility from the IMF when it sets economic programs tied toloans for debtor nations.    Such flexibility would include less rigid economic targets-- which often lead to artificial crises when they are not met-- and more reliance on ranges and benchmarks to monitoreconomic performance.    There is also concern that the level of IMF lending is toolow and the commercial banks, themselves under attack fortawdry loan levels to debtors, want to see it increased.    The IMF, which holds its semi-annual meetings with theWorld Bank next week, will only be a small net lender thisyear. Much of its loan disbursements are offset by repayments.    Meanwhile, most countries, including the United States,acknowledge the banks have not lived up to their commitments.    Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is particularly irritated with the reluctance of commercial banksto lend more to reforming debtors, monetary sources say.    New IMF managing director Michel Camdessus is understood tobe worried about the Fund's image in the developing world,where it is often depicted as the source of economic ills.    Camdessus' experience as former chairman of the so-called"Paris Club" of western creditor governments, has given himextensive first-hand experience of the debt crisis.    Brazil, which in February declared an interest paymerntsmoratorium on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, hasflatly ruled out adopting a program of IMF-sponsored economicreforms. Peru too has rejected an IMF program, curbing debtrepayments to 10 pct of exports.    But the administration official said Brazil's strategy ofusing a moratorium as a negotiating tool might backfire. "It'sprobably turning out to be more complicated than they thought.It underlines the extreme risk that a debtor country takes onitself when it begins down that road," the official said.    Indeed, U.S. banks are laying the groundwork for writingdown their Brazilian loans.    U.S. officials have generally praised most debtors foradopting genuine economic reforms and the multilateralinstitutions for stepping up their lending.    And they point out that Venezuela, Chile and thePhilippines have struck agreement with commercial banksstretching out debt repayments.    But problems still dog assembly of a 7.7 billion dlrs bankloan for Mexico, which many officials acknowledge may be thelast major cash loan for a debtor country.    Instead, banks are being pressed to come up with more novelways of easing the liquidity squeeze in debtor nations.    The prospect of greater official involvement in the debtstrategy depends chiefly on the ability of western nations tocome up with more finance.    While there is sympathy in Congress for various forms ofdebt relief, more U.S. funds for the World Bank or the IMF area virtual impossibility in today's era of budget restraint.    That leaves rich surplus nations like Japan and WestGermany, but neither country favors generalized debt relief.    And the Reagan administration is not inclined to bow toCongressional pressure for changes in regulations governingforeign loans, to make it easier for banks to account fordelays in interest and principal repayments.

reut2-012.sgm, EC PUBLISHES LIST OF U.S. BARRIERS TO FREE TRADE, The European Community responded towidespread U.S. criticism of its trade policies by publishingan extensive list of U.S. actions which pose obstacles to ECexports.    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said the detailed25-page report of alleged malpractices was in response to asimilar document issued by U.S. Administration officials inNovember, and updated a previous EC list.    EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercqsaid its object was to show such actions were not solely takenby trading partners of the U.S. And that "the U.S. Were notinnocents in the matter."    The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercialrelations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariffmeasures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumpingprocedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies.    The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned werenecessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations,and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcominginternational trade talks. "The purpose of the report is to makeclear that trade practices which impede exports are not aunique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans facesimilar problems in the U.S.," it said.    Among the obstacles detailed in the report are importrestrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup,certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms andmachine tools.    It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports.The document said the U.S.'s three-year export enhancementprogram (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidiesgranted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added.    "The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S.EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and willcontinue to do so," it said, adding the current GATT round wouldalso provide an opportunity to address the subject.    The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S.On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts andcertain cottons, restrict EC exports.    In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accordon semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers,standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S.Administration's "buy American" public procurement policy.

"Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and thecountry, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be veryconcerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) mightbe very serious," Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen.    Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand "totalelimination" of the beef import quota by April 1988.    The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor maystrengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyngsaid, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S.    Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan mightretaliate against U.S. products as a result of thesemiconductor dispute.    "They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us," Lyngsaid, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japanhas more to lose in a trade war than the United States.    Lyng told the U.S. cattlemen that the quota on Japanesebeef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choicein food purchases.    He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press foreliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice aswell.

"It would be impossible to provide evidence of compliancewith the agreement" based on sales of only a few days time, hesaid.    Asked by reporters if the sanctions were 100 pct certainfor April 17, he said, "One could never foreclose all options.We have an obligation to listen to the arguments our tradingpartners make."

reut2-012.sgm, U.S. REGULATORS DOWNGRADE BRAZIL TO SUBSTANDARD, In a fresh sign of the strains causedby Brazil's suspension of interest payments on its medium-andlong-term debt, U.S. bank regulators have lowered their ratingof the country's creditworthiness to "substandard," bankerssaid.    Brazil was previously ranked as an "other transfer riskproblem." Reserves would have to be set aside for loans toBrazil only if its credit rating were lowered by another notchto "value impaired," but bankers said the regulators' decisionshould be read as a sign of official concern about thedeterioration in Brazil's finances.    The downgrading was decided by the Interagency CountryValuation Review Committee, which groups regulators fromthe Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpand the Comptroller of the Currency.    The downgrading coincides with the move by several majorU.S. banks to place their loans to Brazil on non-accrual statusbecause of the February 20 suspension of interest on 68 billiondlrs of term debt.    By declaring the loans non-performing, the banks wipe outtens of millions of dollars of accrued, but uncollected,interest payments from their first-quarter accounts. Reuter&#3;

Yeutter told the Senate Finance Committee, "They certainlyhave the macroeconomic policy tools to adjust" to the U.S.reduction in imports.    Asked if the U.S. trade deficit was preventing them fromgoing into a recession, Yeutter replied that result was"certainly possible" and was the reason why they should adjusttheir monetary, fiscal and tax policies.

He said he expected the current decline in the dollar toshow up soon in the decline in the value of imports.    He expected the U.S. would soon start importing less fromJapan and Europe and would start exporting more to Europe wherethere's less rigidity on imports. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, WORLD BANK REFINANCED 500 BILLION YEN OF LOANS, The World Bank over the last month repaidand refinanced 500 billion yen in loans at more favourableinterest rates in what was the first step in a plan torefinance its existing debt, Eugene Rotberg, World Bankvice-president/treasurer said.    He told Reuters in a telephone interview from Washingtonthat the moves are consistent with, but not driven by, theBank's view that interest rates have essentially bottomed outand will move higher by year-end.    Rotberg was responding to a question following news theBank would exercise its option to prepay early some 196 mlnSwiss francs of existing bonds in the Swiss franc market.    The bond redemptions are the first in the public market andmay be followed by similar moves in other capital markets ifthe Bank considers the exercise financially beneficial andconsistent with its overall funding strategy.    Rotberg noted that the World Bank is very liquid right now,with some 18 billion dlrs in cash available. The Bank will belooking at various instruments and the levels they are tradingat in determining what issues will be repaid, he said.    However, Rotberg said that unlike the yen loans, there wasno immediate plan to refinance the Swiss franc bonds, althoughthe Bank could possibly issue new debt in that market over thenext few months.    He said that the yen loans, which were the equivalent ofsome three billion dlrs principal amount, had been from theJapanese long-term credit banks, trust banks and insurancecompanies and had interest rates of between seven and nine pct.    All the borrowings were refinanced as traditionalsyndicated loans with the same parities at the Japaneselong-term prime rate, currently 5.8 pct.    The World Bank borrows in excess of 10 billion dlrs a year,with almost all its borrowings in medium and long-term fixedrate markets.    Rotberg declined to say whether the 1/4 point rise in U.S.Prime rates yesterday to 7-3/4 pct signalled a reversal in thetrend in interest rates. "Over the short term, rates could go upor they could go down," he said, adding that the bank takes alonger view on interest rates when deciding its financingstrategy. However, given the current level of interest rates,it would not be wise to take short-term money on to theliability side of the Bank's balance sheet, he said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, SUNSHINE MINING CHIEF SEES SILVER AT 9.00 DLRS, Heightened concern over renewedinflation is feeding the rally in silver and the upward movecould drive the inflation hedge metal this year to as much as9.00 dlrs per troy ounce, Mike Boswell chairman of SunshineMining Co told Reuters in an interview.    "The anticipated higher inflation is being manifested insilver rather than in gold which is the traditional choice ofinflation hedgers," said Boswell.    The strength could put silver in a range of "8.00 to 9.00dlrs even without any material swings in supply/demand,"Boswell said.    The buying interest for silver on the New York CommodityExchange (Comex) continued strong, with prices rising today toa September 1986 high of 6.465 dlrs per ounce. However goldlagged at 426.30 dlrs, the strongest price since late Januarythis year.    Boswell said silver has been "under-valued for so longrelative to gold but it's closing up the price gap."    He noted that silver last year held at the depressed levelof 5.00 dlrs while gold was soaring to more than 400.00 dlrs onconcern over the heated political unrest in South Africa. "Thestrength was not filtering down to silver last year. Nowwe're seeing a delayed reaction," the Sunshine Mining officialsaid.    Almost a year ago, U.S. producers shut down two of theirlargest silver properties, Sunshine and Hecla mining companies,both located in Idaho.    Boswell estimated that the closings slashed U.S. silverproduction by 10 mln ounces last year to less than 40 mlnounces.    "Low silver prices and high labor costs made ituneconomical to keep the mines opened," he said.    Increased imports from Mexico and Peru have made up for theloss of production in the United States which consumes 160 to170 mln ounces annually, Boswell said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-012.sgm, BELGIUM TO SIMPLIFY BOURSE TAX SYSTEM, Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskenssaid he will announce measures in the next few days making iteasier for non-residents to recoup the 25 pct withholding taxlevied on investment income in Belgium.    In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also said he hopedthe cabinet would tomorrow approve the abolition of boursetransaction taxes for non-residents, making Brussels one of thefew stock exchanges in the world where foreign investors werenot subjected to such a tax.    He said both measures were aimed at attracting capitalimports, reducing Belgium's heavy net capital outflows.    Under the present system, non-residents pay withholding taxon their income from Belgian investments and can then reclaimit from Belgian authorities.    But financial analysts said the procedure for recouping thetax is so bureaucratic and slow that it effectively acts as abarrier to foreign investment in Belgium, especially in thesecondary bond market.    Eyskens said he was ready to "simplify and eventuallysuppress" the procedure for non-residents and would announcedetails in the next few days.    Financial analysts said the move would be far moresignificant than the imminent abolition for non-residents ofthe minimal bourse transaction taxes. These are set at threerates - 0.07 pct, 0.14 pct and 0.35 pct - according to the typeof paper transacted.    Eyskens said he hoped later to be able to abolish thetransaction taxes for residents as well, but this would dependon progress in cutting the government's high budget deficit.    He called the current 25 pct level of witholding tax "muchtoo high" and said he hoped to reduce it in the longer term,perhaps as part of an overall reform of Belgian tax.    But he added this would have to be done progressivelybecause of its budgetary impact. The tax raises 170 billionfrancs a year in revenues, he said.    Eyskens envisaged a cut to a basic 15 pct, after which arate could be set for each new security issued.    He said that as well as aggravating net capital outflows,the high rate of withholding tax also meant the treasury wasforced to borrow at higher interest rates.    But he said it was politically impossible to reduce taxeson investment income before those on earned income had been cutas part of the tax reform, planned for late 1980s. REUTER&#3;

"On Tuesday I shall be going to Washington for meetings ofthe (IMF) Interim Committee and Development Committee, and weshall of course be having a meeting of the G-7," Lawson said.    "And on the G-7, although there is no formal agenda, I wouldimagine that the first thing we do would be to review how theParis accord has gone since it was agreed in February."    Lawson said G-7 finance ministers will be reviewingmedium-term economic objectives and projections involvingdomestic and external variables. Also examined will beperformance indicators for each country.    The Paris accord set objectives for such sectors as growth,inflation, current account and trade balances, budgetperformances, monetary conditions and exchange rates.    Lawson said "At both the G-7 and the Interim Committee wewill undoubtedly be discussing the debt problem. Clearly thedebt problem is still with us, and still with us in quite a bigway."    "In many ways the problems of the big debtor countries, andindeed the poorest countries, are every bit as acute as theywere when they began. It will be with us for a very long time."    Lawson said he knew of no new debt initiative which mightbe presented and discussed next week in Washington. "We've gotto go on a case-by-case basis," Lawson said.  Possibilities fora coordinated approach to the problem would be something hewould raise within the IMF, Lawson said.    He noted the rise this week in U.S. Short-term interestrates, and said that a significant rise in borrowing costswould make the debt problem more acute.    Special attention would go to Brazil next week, but Lawsonadded, "I do not expect anything to come to a head on that."    Lawson said he told Brazilian Finance Minister DilsonFunaro here in February that Britain would not intervene andpress British commercial banks into giving Brazil easierborrowing conditions.

British Petroleum currently owns about 55 pct of StandardOil's outstanding common stock and to acquire the remainder atthe tender offer price of 70 dlrs per share would cost 7.4billion dlrs.    British Petroleum intends to fund two-thirds of thatpurchase with borrowed funds and the rest with cash.

reut2-012.sgm, EYSKENS SAYS US PRIME RISES WILL AID CURRENCIES, Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskenswarmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates,calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and CanadaParis accord on stabilising currencies.    The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policyconvergence among major countries, he added.    In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear hebelieved the countries involved in the accord - the U.S.,Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - had agreed"tentative" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates.    Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting ofEuropean Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs inBelgium this weekend focusing on the international monetarysituation and proposals for strengthening the European MonetarySystem (EMS).    Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets,Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving "moreor less workable" despite what he called evident disagreementsover U.S. Economic and monetary policy between TreasurySecretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman PaulVolcker.    Besides Baker's public statements that had dramaticallyinfluenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.AndJapan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against theyen, he said.    But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo couldreach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. "Ithink agreement is quite possible," he said.     Eyskens said he was "very agreeably surprised" by thisweek's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite theobvious negative consequences for debtor countries.    "It is a positive element which goes further than the(Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account ofits content," he said.    He added that coordination of interest rates was afundamental element of economic and monetary convergencebetween leading industrialised economies.    "A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuationranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by amore coordinated policy of interest rates," he said.    Eyskens made clear he believed the G-6 countries had agreedin Paris on ranges in which to hold their currencies.    He said the end of the February 22 Louvre accord, in whichthe partners agreed to cooperate closely to foster exchangerate stability around current levels, clearly alluded to a"system of tentative (fluctuation) margins."    He added the meeting and the statement would have beenmeaningless if the G-6 had not discussed the technicalities ofimplementing it.    Eyskens said there was growing economic convergence amongleading industrialised countries pointing towards greater orderin the international monetary system.

Noranda spokesman Denis Morin said it was impossible tojudge how long the shutdown might last but said he thought itcould be at least one week.    The mine produced 1,792,000 tonnes of ore in 1986, Morinsaid. It has a mineral inventory of 35,065,000 tonnes.    In the mine's three zones last year, copper grade was 1.10pct at Needle Mountain, 0.30 pct at Copper Mountain Oxide and1.32 pct at Murdochville, Morin said.    Another Noranda spokesman said the smelter at Murdochville,which has not been shut down, has the capacity to treat 218,000tonnes of mineral concentrate per year.    The smelter treats ore from other mines as well as productfrom the Murdochville facility, he said.

reut2-012.sgm, BELGIUM SAYS U.S PRIME RISES WILL AID CURRENCIES, Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskenswarmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates,calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and CanadaParis accord on stabilising currencies.    The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policyconvergence among major countries, he added.    In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear hebelieved the countries involved in the accord -- the U.S.,Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada -- had agreed"tentative" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates.    Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting ofEuropean Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs inBelgium this weekend focusing on the international monetarysituation and proposals for strengthening the European MonetarySystem (EMS).    Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets,Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving "moreor less workable" despite what he called evident disagreementsover U.S. Economic and monetary policy between TreasurySecretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman PaulVolcker.    Besides Baker's public statements that had dramaticallyinfluenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.AndJapan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against theyen, he said.    But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo couldreach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. "Ithink agreement is quite possible," he said.     Eyskens said he was "very agreeably surprised" by thisweek's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite theobvious negative consequences for debtor countries.    "It is a positive element which goes further than the(Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account ofits content," he said.    He added that coordination of interest rates was afundamental element of economic and monetary convergencebetween leading industrialised economies.    "A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuationranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by amore coordinated policy of interest rates," he said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-012.sgm, NIGERIAN NAIRA FIRMS AFTER RULE CHANGE, The Nigerian naira firmed  against thedollar, banking sources said, after the rules governing foreignexchange auctions at the central bank were changed.    The marginal rate set at today's auction, from whichreporters were barred for the first time since the sessionsbegan last September, was 3.7001 to the dollar compared with4.0002 at the last session on March 19, the sources said.    Under the new system unveiled on March 20 and in operationfor the first time today, bidding banks must pay for foreignexchange at the rate they bid, rather than as previously at therate of the lowest successful bid.    The measure was aimed at discouraging banks from biddinghigh and thus driving down the naira's value. But bankingsources and other analysts said demand for foreign exchangeremained sharply higher than the available funds.    Henceforth the sessions will be held every fortnight,instead of weekly, and today only 80 mln dlrs was on offercompared with the 50 mln dlrs usually on sale each week.    The rule change appeared to have an immediate impact onbids. Today's highest bid was 4.06 to the dollar, compared witha top bid of 4.25 two weeks ago.    Banks who bid higher than the marginal rate will be able topass on their rate to their customers, while the marginal ratewill only act as a marker for transactions. REUTER&#3;
reut2-012.sgm, COFFEE PRICES SET TO CONTINUE SLIDE - TRADERS, Coffee prices look set to continuesliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards anew International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotaaccord, according to coffee traders and analysts.    Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lowsyesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, whenthe lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmedexpectations that efforts to restore quotas would not berevived at this stage, they said.    The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 centsa lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years.    Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO's annualSeptember council session, and in the interim the Brazilianfrost season from June to August may prove the only bullishfactor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futuresbounced back from the lows today towards the previous tradingrange around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the marketrecovered from yesterday's "confidence blip," one tradercommented.    But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lowerprices in the near future, one trade source said.    The market had become increasingly vulnerable toyesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stgsecond position trading range for 22 successive sessions, hesaid.    Technically the market is more likely to decline further asit absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a "three figure mentality," andspeculators may elect to push for coffee prices below thepsychological 1,000 stg level, he added.    Some traders said today's upturn was in part due toBrazil's opening last night of May green coffee exportregistrations.     This had been widely anticipated by the market and came asno surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty andlight trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence.    However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test ofsupport at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the onlypossible supportive influence on the horizon being the approachof Brazil's frost season, they said.    Roasters are believed to be well covered, limitingactivities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally nottaking up producer offers, they added.    Central American producers have sold the bulk of theircurrent crops, but robusta producers in West Africa andIndonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment,and this could pressure prices further, traders said.    However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to bebullish, advised caution. "Everybody's bearish now, just as theywere bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg," he said.    Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expresseddoubts the price spiral would continue much below currentlevels. "One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers --there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall."    While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retailprices.    "Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like thatat this stage," a General Foods spokesman said.    Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway inresponse to market weakness. At the beginning of March theprice of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue tofall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added.    Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts inthe near future.    "The market seems to have established some equilibrium anddoesn't look set to go much lower," a Nestle spokesmancommented.    Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, whichfell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg perkilo for medium quality, traders added. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, BANK MONTREAL REASONABLY OPTIMISTIC ON BRAZIL, Bank of Montreal &lt;BMO.M> ChairmanWilliam Mulholland said he was reasonably optimistic that debtnegotiations between Brazil and its commercial bank creditorscan be accomplished satisfactorily in the long run.    "It's going to be a bit rocky short term ... a couple ofmonths ... but I am reasonably optimistic longer term," he tolda press briefing here.    Earlier, Mulholland announced that Bank of Montreal hasformally applied to swap up to 100 mln dlrs of its roughly onebillion dlr cross border exposure to Brazil into local equityinvestments under a novel conversion scheme.    Tensions have been running high between Brazil and its bankcreditors since President Jose Sarney imposed a unilateralsuspension of interest payments on some 68 billion dlrs ofcommercial bank debt on February 20, bankers said.    Only yesterday, three leading U.S. banks voluntarily puttheir Brazilian loans on non-accrual status and took a heftycut in net income for the first quarter ended March 31.    Bankers saw this as a clear refusal to be intimidated intogranting major concessions as forthcoming refinancing talks.    Bank of Montreal's Mulholland regretted Brazil's action butdeclined to discuss what action his bank might take.    Mulholland merely said that Bank of Montreal had notcanceled any of its short-term credit lines that came up forrenewal on March 31.    However, John Bradlow, senior vice president of thecorporate and goverment banking division, said that it waspossible that Bank of Montreal might follow the U.S. banks'lead in its second quarter results accounting.    "A decision will be made at April 30 or in the first weeksof May," he told reporters after the briefing. Unlike mostmajor U.S. banks, whose reporting year ends on December 31,Canadian banks operate on a November through October basis.    At the press briefing, Mulholland detailed the proposeddebt/equity conversion scheme, which is aimed at boostinginvestment capital and conserving foreign exchange reserves.    Unlike many existing programs, Bank of Montreal intends tosell its own dollar-denominated debt at par to either theobligor or local investors for cruzados, which would then beploughed into Brazilian assets.    Mulholland said current debt/equity schemes, in which bankdebt is often sold to foreign third parties at a discount, werelike "peddling off debt at fire sale prices". He added thatthey could do pyschological harm to investor confidence.    While acknowledging that Brazil has yet to give itsofficial blessing to the plan, Mulholland predicted, "if it issupported, we are going to see more of this."    Sources at other large banks with sizeable exposure toBrazil were not so sure about the scheme's success.    "I don't think it's going to fly because of the impact itwould have on money supply and other political reasons," saidone banker, noting that earlier informal proposals along thesame lines received "fairly neutral responses."    "And is there a market for such investment in a time ofgreat uncertainty," he added.    Mulholland admitted, "it is something of an experiment....some one has to screw up the courage and do something."    "It is very important that avenues (to reversing netcapital outflows) are broadened," he added, noting that inrecent years the options have in fact been narrowing.    Another senior banker agreed that debt/equity swapproposals, such as Bank of Montreal's, should be explored anddeveloped but warned that Brasilia has been "very ambivalent"about debt/equity schemes thus far.    The banker added, "debt/equity conversion should happen butit is not a major instrument for solving debt problems." Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, STERLING REBOUNDS ON LAWSON "TARGET"-DENIAL, Sterling made a sharp recovery when U.K.Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson described remarks hemade yesterday on targets for the pound as "insignificant,"rallying back up almost exactly to the levels it had fetchedbefore Lawson spoke yesterday, dealers and analysts said.    They said sterling would likely leave the limelight onceagain to trade quietly around current levels, as the marketsset their sights on the dollar, yen and mark again ahead of keyinternational monetary talks in Washington next week.    Sterling ended its European day at 1.6020/30 dlrs,virtually unchanged from yesterday's last 1.6040/50 dlrs,fetched before Lawson's first comment. But it was well up onlevels just above 1.59 dlrs which it had held until the secondcomment came.    Against the mark, sterling recovered to close at2.9190/9240 marks after today's opening 2.9040/90 and lastnight's 2.9210/45.    "On balance, it is as if nothing happened ... We are back towhere we were before," Mark Brett, economist at securities houseBarclays de Zoete Wedd said.    "This whole story is like a storm in a teacup," a dealer witha U.K. Bank commented.    The pound's recovery was triggered when Lawson criticisedmedia coverage of comments he made yesterday, when he told aconference he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was.    In this context, Lawson was reported to have specifiedrates of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound inremarks which markets were quick to interpret as a signal tosell sterling.    Lawson said today he had merely stated yesterday'sapproximate value of the pound.    "The wrong end of the stick was picked up," he toldreporters, adding his comments did in no way signal a change inBritish exchange rate policies.    Dealers and analysts said the reactions to both statementswere clear evidence that the market, frustrated by the relativecurrency stability after the February 22 Paris agreement, wasdesperate to reactivate trading and would react to any cluesoffered about the contents of the currency accord.    In Paris, finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canadaare widely believed to have agreed exchange rate targets,although no participant has specified these in an apparent bidto foster stability by keeping markets guessing.    "The markets are absolutely desperate to get clues on Groupof Six (countries that are part to the Paris agreement) targets... The number of rumours flying around is bigger than everbefore," said Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Brett.    Analysts said neither yesterday's remarks nor today's hadchanged their impression that after Paris, sterling wastargeted to trade in broad ranges against major currencies.     All polled analysts said if anything, the 2.90 marks levelmentioned by Lawson was probably the centre of a wide20-pfennig range which sterling would easily hold, helped bygood economic indicators and relatively high interest rates.    "It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of anelection ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tiehimself to a fixed rate," Brett said. He expected sterling tofirm over the next few weeks, to around 2.95 marks and 1.63dlrs, as overseas investors reappraised high-yieldinginvestments here.    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase ManhattanSecurities, said he was not surprised to see Lawson qualify hissterling target comments so quickly.    "His remarks gave markets a target to aim at," he said,adding, "He (Lawson) talked himself into a bit of a corner onthis ... It made him a hostage to fortune."    Marshall and other analysts dismissed a theory, that byquoting target rates Lawson had attempted to put pressure onprime Minister Margaret Thatcher to agree to British membershipof the European Monetary System (EMS), as implausible.

Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco's firstquarter refining and marketing results "will look pretty poor,"because of low margins in January and February.

Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level wouldresult in a 40 pct increase in oil company explorationspending.    President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amocoreduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by atotal of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a dropin oil and gas prices.    Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires thatreserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end priceswill remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said thedrop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserveestimate by four pct.    Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gasliquids production to decline about five pct this year fromlast year's 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals madelast year when oil prices were falling.    He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by thepurchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels perday to the company's 1987 U.S. production.    Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to beincreasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-freegasoline, especially the higher octane grades.    He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vaporpressure will further tighten the industry's gasolineproduction capacity. Reuter&#3;

The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn.,would require quotas on the import of any merchandisecontaining over 25 pct sugar or other farm products which arenow subject to U.S. quotas.    Supporters of the amendment said it is aimed at curbingshipments of food products containing sugar from Canada.However, the Ways and Means committee, which has overalljurisdiction on trade legislation, will try to kill theamendment as protectionist, a committee aide said.    An Agriculture committee aide acknowledged the proposalprobably will not survive scrutiny by other House committees.But he said the amendment was introduced in part to send awarning to U.S. companies considering moving food processingplants to Canada to avoid the restrictive U.S. sugar quota.    In debate on the amendment yesterday, Rep. Stangeland andother supporters said the proposal would have no effect on thestatus of foreign trade zones.    Sugar producer groups pushed for the amendment onsugar-containing products because they believe sugar is beingshipped to the United States in food products as a way tocircumvent the quota on raw sugar.

reut2-012.sgm, LITTLE SCOPE FOR U.S. RATE RISE - FANNIE MAE&lt;FNM>, There is little scope for a substantialincrease in U.S. interest rates during 1987, said FederalNational Mortgage Association chairman David Maxwell.    Speaking to the New York Financial Writers' Association,Maxwell said he viewed this week's rise in U.S. banks' prime rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon.    "I don't see a substantial rise in rates this year. Ifanything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than totighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of theeconomy are showing weakness," Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buysmortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities.    Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last twoyears had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Aone pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said.    Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds outother sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital.    "There's no evidence that housing is crowding firms out ofthe long-term debt market," he said. Both home mortgage debtand long-term corporate debt grew at about equal annual ratesof about 13 pct in 1986 -- a year when mortgage originations of442 billion dlrs needed record housing capital, he said.

reut2-012.sgm, GOURMET COFFEE MAKES U.S. SUPERMARKET DEBUT, Shoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream,Dijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to thesupermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitzfor national-brand "gourmet" coffees.    General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A andP, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are theonly two national brand roasters so far to introduce thehigher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets.    But industry insiders believe there is substantial growthpotential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales inregular ground roast types.    "I would suspect General Foods will make a name forthemselves with their gourmet line," said a coffee tradesource. "What it could do is really dent the small-store,whole-bean business," the trade source added.    The new lines are designed to appeal to a classicadvertising composite--the "yuppie" consumer.    They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine andwere "first on their block with a wok," as described by KarinBrown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee,called Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division.    Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foodssubsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, describedits potential appeal as "a status thing."    At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it isexpensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold insmall specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. hasjust cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrsfor 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,according to an A and P executive.    Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has "nothing to announce atthis point" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither doesHills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third andfourth size market spot by volume with A and P.    Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress ofGeneral Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the markettakes off.    General Foods and A and P hope their new products will helppush coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption inthe United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales showno signs of picking up.    Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffeequality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.    "The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the nameof profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers thiswas quality coffee," Gallant said.    As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for thebrew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, "they turnaround and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have aCoke'," he said.    Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who haveconfirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers areaiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd-- the yuppie composite.    "Where else are you going to go?," an industry source said."Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There areno other markets. The only area that's not been promoted isgourmet," he said.    In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmetline could provide much higher margins to roasters than regularground roast coffees produce.    Generally, retail prices are about twice the price ofgreen, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs ofroasting, packaging and distribution, and then deductingoften-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sellcoffee near the trade price as a "loss leader," a productdesigned to draw shoppers into the store.    But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricingstructure prevails, industry sources said. There is no tradediscounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including aspecial valve designed to keep the beans fresher.    Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality greenbeans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmetcoffee are now almost three times the price of green.    Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference.General Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test marketsurveys for Private Collection came back for more.    And product manager Brown points to the success of moreexpensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling inrestricted high income areas and are now available in almostevery supermarket in the country.    A and P is similarly optimistic. "We think we'll doextremely well in the gourmet market," Gallant said.    Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of PrivateCollection in selected high income areas, while A and P offersits 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'ClockRoyale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore,New York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.

reut2-012.sgm, U.S. ACREAGE CUTS SEEN LIMITING STOCK BUILD, Sharp cuts this year in U.S. plantedacreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile butwill at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, AgricultureDepartment and industry commodity analysts said.    "The scenario is turning around on stocks. The wholesupply/demand picture could finally be getting more inbalance," a USDA analyst said.    The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicatedthat U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annualacreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mlnacres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program,bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres,almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.    Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 willprobably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup instocks, analysts said.    "It's a substantially different story from last year whenwe added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile," VernonMcMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.    Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likelytranslate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.    McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resultingin a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpileof 5.45 billion bushels.    "To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we'reat least in a holding pattern," George Hoffman, director ofcommodity analysis for Pillsbury said.    Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to "significantly less"domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.    USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage andsaid wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least notincrease. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, nextyear's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.    "We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now,so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreagereductions, that would be an improvement," an AgricultureDepartment wheat analyst said.    Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be thesmallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lowerfinal production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to100 mln bushels, analysts said.    As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in theconservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programswill be more effective because they will force more highproducing land out of production, a USDA analyst said.    "We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very longtunnel," the analyst said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, U.S. ACREAGE CUTS SEEN LIMITING STOCK BUILD, Sharp cuts this year in U.S. plantedacreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile butwill at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, AgricultureDepartment and industry commodity analysts said.    "The scenario is turning around on stocks. The wholesupply/demand picture could finally be getting more inbalance," a USDA analyst said.    The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicatedthat U.S. farmers will idle 52-55 mln acres in annual acreagereduction programs this year. An additional 20 mln acres havebeen enrolled in the conservation reserve program, bringingtotal idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres, almost athird of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.    Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 willprobably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup instocks, analysts said.    "It's a substantially different story from last year whenwe added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile," VernonMcMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.    Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likelytranslate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.    McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resultingin a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpileof 5.45 billion bushels.    "To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we'reat least in a holding pattern," George Hoffman, director ofcommodity analysis for Pillsbury said.    Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to "significantly less"domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.    USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage andsaid wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least notincrease. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, nextyear's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.    "We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now,so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreagereductions, that would be an improvement," an AgricultureDepartment wheat analyst said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, JAPANESE BANKS EXPAND HONG KONG PRESENCE, At a time when Britain is threateningto revoke the license of Japanese banks in retaliation forrestrictive trade practices, Hong Kong is rolling out thewelcome mat to Japan.    The British colony last week issued a banking licence tothe Bank of Fukuoka Ltd, making it the 24th Japanese bank here.    Japan has the largest banking contingent in Hong Kong,followed by the U.S. With 22 banks. Eleven Japanese banks haverepresentative offices here and Japanese institutions operate34 deposit-taking companies (DTCs).    Assistant banking commissioner K.K Wong told Reuters: "Thereare no special favours towards the Japanese...But because ofJapan's strong economy and currency, they easily meet ourrequirement on assets (14 billion U.S. Dlrs)."    The Japanese control the largest share of assets of thefinancial institutions here but incorporated elsewhere, with980.5 billion H.K. Dlrs at end-1986, or 57.5 pct of the total.    "Hong Kong authorities welcome Japanese banks," said HaruoKimura, assistant general manager of the Bank of Tokyo. "But theU.S. And Britain are unhappy with the slow liberalisation ofthe Tokyo financial market."    Japanese bankers said Hong Kong offers good businessopportunities, especially in China trade, to Japanese banks whoare following their clients' international expansion.    "As their clients become more international, they have tokeep up and follow them," said Yutaka Toda, Dai-Ichi KangyoBank's general manager here.    "We can have access to local traders and regionalcorporations," said Bank of Tokyo's Kimura. "We can also pick upbusiness with China."    Bankers said more Japanese banks are on the way. An influxof Japanese banks began in the late 1970s when the governmentlifted a moratorium on new licences. But newcomers are allowedone branch each and only the Bank of Tokyo, Sanwa Bank andSumitomo Bank have more than one branch.    Because of this limitation, Japanese banks have mostlyconcentrated on wholesale business.    "It is very difficult to compete with those giants such asthe Hongkong Bank and the Bank of China," said Kimura of theBank of Tokyo.    Bank of Tokyo has the largest Japanese bank network herewith seven branches, while Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corpand the Bank of China groups each have hundreds of branches.    To broaden their client and deposit base, some Japanesebanks have taken equity in local banks. The latest such movewas Dai-Ichi Kangyo's increase of its stake in Chekiang FirstBank last year to 95 pct from 33 pct.    Tokai Bank, Fuji Bank and Mitsubishi Bank also haveinterests in small local banks.    But Mitsubishi, not content with its single-branch licenceand a 25 pct stake in the small Liu Chong Hing Bank, boughtMercantile Bank Ltd's multi-branch licence early this year.    "We will open one more branch in (Hong Kong's district of)Kowloon soon, to better serve our clients on the other side ofthe harbour," said Mitsubishi Bank general manager TakeshiTange.    Their weakness in the retail market forces Japanese banksto rely on the interbank market for funding.    Government data show that despite their large share oftotal assets, Japanese banks had only 54.4 billion dlrs indeposits at end-1986, or 17.1 pct of deposits of banks in HongKong incorporated elsewhere.    "Most Japanese banks' international lendings in the regionare booked in Hong Kong," said a Japanese banker who declined tobe named.    He said it is mainly for tax reasons, adding that assetssuch as loans booked in Hong Kong are not subject to Japanesetax.    Japanese banks are barred by the Tokyo government fromissuing Eurobonds, but their Hong Kong subsidiaries can tap theEuromarket and lend the funds to the parent.    Bankers said this role could be undermined by a five pctcapital adequacy ratio that goes into effect next year,requiring many DTC's to increase their capital. Many Japanesebanks are seeking special treatment for their largely offshoreoperations or a different risk calculation for their assets.    "I don't think this will stop them from coming here," said abanker. "But it may mean they have to conduct some of theiroffshore funding operations elsewhere." REUTER&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, CHINA CURTAILS KEY REFORM GOAL OF REALISTIC PRICES, Fear of social instability and inflationhas forced China to curtail a major economic reform --overhauling a pricing system in which prices bear no relationto production costs.    Despite pledges last year that price changes were needed toget the economy on the right track, Peking has repeatedly saidno major change will happen this year. The backtracking hasoccurred during a conservative backlash following theresignation in January of reformist Communist Party leader HuYaobang, western diplomats and Chinese sources say.    "Price changes in the last two years have aroused greatpublic discontent, especially in the cities," one westerndiplomat said.    "Chinese were used to stable prices for 30 years from 1949when the communists took over. On a recent visit to two majorcities, the refrain from all the officials was the need topreserve social stability."    A Chinese journalist said the reformers under-estimated thepotential public resistance to price increases.    "A major review of all economic reforms is under way, thebiggest since the reforms began in 1979, because many thingsare not going well -- a large budget deficit, too rapid priceincreases and no major improvement in productivity of statefirms," the Chinese journalist said.    This view was reflected by the official People's Daily in amajor article this week. The daily said price increases hadbeen taking place too quickly in recent years.    "In future, price changes should be only in small steps," itsaid, adding that wage increases and lax monetary policies hadresulted in too much money chasing too few goods.    The Chinese journalist said the review was in part due topolitical factors.    "Economics and politics are inseparable in China. But thewestern media are wrong to classify the leadership intoreformers and conservatives. All the leaders agree on the maindirection -- economic reform and the open-door," he said.    "But there are differences of opinion on the pace of reformand on specific policies. No one is advocating a return to howthings were before 1979."    Those who say prices should reflect production costsbelieve the issue is vital to China's economy.    Sugar is an example. An official newspaper said earlierthis year that over 40 pct of the country's sugar mills werelosing money, or had closed because the price of sugar had notchanged for 20 years, while the production costs have risensharply over the same period.    The western diplomat said Chinese leaders did not fear abacklash against rising prices would result in rioting in thestreets, which they had the means to control.    "The bottom line is how such protests would be used by thosein the power struggle (inside the Communist Party)," he said.    Said a foreign lawyer, referring to the crisis sparked bystudent demonstrations which led to Hu's replacement, "Theleadership here is a self-perpetuating oligarchy. There is noway that it is going to give up power."    The Chinese journalist added that China appears to havereached a crossroads.    "There is no clear proposal as to what to do next," he said."Premier Zhao (Ziyang) has instructed his think-tanks to come upwith how to continue the reforms in 1988."    But for the time being at least, the path leading to pricereforms is out of favour. REUTER&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, PAKISTANI DECISION WILL HURT KENYAN TEA EXPORTS, Pakistan's decision to suspend teaimport licences will hurt Kenyan tea exports in the short termwhile exporters seek new markets, sources close to Nairobibroking houses and exporters said.    Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colomboyesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences inorder to link tea imports to Pakistani exports.    The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports toPakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, whileimports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenyaprovides over 50 pct of Pakistan's tea imports.    The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did notcome as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of thetrade imbalance for some time.    "We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action ...(it) will certainly hurt Kenya's tea industry in the short termas Pakistan is Kenya's second largest market," a source at onebroking house told Reuters.    One tea broker said Pakistan's move had already affectedKenya's tea trade and was largely responsible for an averagefall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasalast Monday.    "The trend is likely to continue until other countriesreplace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea,"he added.    Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan,Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as majormarkets for its tea, the sources added.    Small-scale exporters who export mainly to Pakistan wouldbe worst hit by the Pakistani move as it would take them longerto find new outlets, they said. REUTER&#3;

The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31said active participation in writing world farm trade rules atthe next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.    Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked aneasing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports whichstressed the need for strict controls on some products tomaintain self-sufficiency in food.    Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow toimprove productivity and demand/supply imbalances.    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainlyresponsible for higher domestic prices, it said.    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices buthas also resulted in higher agricultural imports which hasworsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the papersaid.    This could make it difficult to improve the industry'sstructure, the paper said.

South Korea has agreed to pay Japanese trading houses justover 400 dlrs C and F per tonne, up from an average of 350 dlrsin the first quarter and throughout 1986, they said.    South Korean demand for imported ethylene this month hasrisen to 17,000 tonnes from 10,000 last month, and the countrymay face difficulties covering the extra volume, they said.    &lt;Korea Petrochemical Industries Corp>, a producer of highdensity polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene, will more thandouble its ethylene requirements to 9,000 tonnes a month from4,000 when it completes a plant expansion at the end of thismonth, the sources said.    &lt;Honan Ethylene Corp's> import requirements have risen to8,000 tonnes a month from 6,000 tonnes last year to meet strongdemand from &lt;Honan Petrochemical Co>, which makes HDPE andethylene glycol, and &lt;Hangyang Chemical>, which produceslow-density polyethylene and vinyl chloride monomer, they said.    But Japan's ethylene plants are already operating at almostfull capacity of 4.5 mln tonnes a year just to fulfill domesticdemand, the sources said.    "And even if Japan had the additional ethylene, there is alogistical problem of finding extra appropriate-sized vesselsto ship it to Korea," said one trading house source.    Japanese trading companies are looking to alternativesources to supply South Korea's needs, including Saudi Arabia,Qatar and Mexico, they said.    But long-haul voyages are expensive as the product has tobe shipped at a temperature of minus 103 degrees centigrade tokeep it in a liquid form, they said.    Japan has no plans to invest further in the ethyleneindustry in order to cope with the additional demand, despiterising prices, trading house sources said.    South Korea has two projects in hand which will increaseits ethylene production capacity by 500,000 tonnes a year bythe end of 1989, so the strong demand surge for imports is onlya medium-term trend, they said.

It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helpedto keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.    The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swisseconomy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the moredifficult international economic climate facing exportindustry.    The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth inSwiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.    Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as themotor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow bythree pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.    Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. Allthree figures are well below the Swiss average for recentyears. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.    The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which hasfirmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressureon Swiss exporters.    It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a moremodest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, whenimport prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.

reut2-012.sgm, REAGAN'S STRENGTH IN U.S. CONGRESS APPEARS SAPPED, President Reagan's reduced strengthin Congress has been demonstrated by the U.S. Senate's decisionto approve a highway spending bill despite his attempts to vetoit, political analysts said.    "He's very weakened," said William Schneider of the privateAmerican Enterprise public policy group after the Senate voted67-33 yesterday to ignore Reagan's veto of the road bill.    Schneider contrasted Reagan's failure with his previousability to win clear majorities on major issues.    Sustaining his veto required him to win just one-third ofthe votes in either house of Congress.    It was the third consecutive fight over a presidential vetoon which Congress had defied Reagan, whose clout with thelegislature has been greatly diminished by the arms-for-Iranscandal and the capture of a majority in the Senate by theopposition Democratic party in the November 1986 election.    Congress overrode Reagan's veto of a popular water projectsbill in January and last autumn Congress rejected his veto ofeconomic sanctions against South Africa.    But this time the president laid his full authority on theline, even making a rare journey to Capitol Hill to plead forsupport in person.    With both the House and Senate in Democratic hands,analysts say Reagan is swiftly becoming a lame duck, facingdifficulties in enacting his own legislative agenda, especiallygiven the furore over the Iran arms deal.    The situation contrasts with Reagan's first six years inoffice when a Republican-controlled Senate and the backing ofconservative Democrats in the House enabled Reagan to winpassage of most of his legislative priorities.    Reagan's ability to veto legislation he dislikes had beenhis strongest weapon in dealing with Congress, but his defeaton the highway bill was expected to reduce the credibility ofhis veto power.    Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, told theNew York Times earlier this week that if Reagan lost "there willbe no brake on -- if you suggest a presidential veto you willbe laughed away."    Yesterday's defeat came two days after the House ofRepresentatives' overwhelming rejection of a presidential vetoon the highways bill by 350 votes to 73.    White House strategists had presented the veto fight as atest of Reagan's strength as he attempted to recover from thescandal over secret arms sales to Iran.    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas pleaded withfellow party members to back Reagan because "this may determinethe strength of the presidency for the next 21 months."    The defeat showed the problems facing any president in hisfinal years in office. Reagan's term expires in January 1989.    A majority of Republicans in the House of Representativesand 13 in the Senate apparently decided their own politicalconcerns have become more important than the president's.    "President Reagan, he ain't going to be running in 1988, butI am," Congressman Arthur Ravenel, a South Carolina Republican,said on Tuesday of his decision to back a bill that means moneyand jobs for his home district in new highway construction.    The defeat interrupted a good streak for Reagan, who wonapplause for his selection in February of former Senatemajority leader Howard Baker to replace Donald Regan as WhiteHouse chief of staff, and was believed by most politicalanalysts to have benefitted from a televised speech and a newsconference on the Iran affair last month.    A steady drop in Reagan's job approval ratings appeared tolevel off in recent weeks. The president slumped from about 65pct last autumn to about 42 pct after the Tower Commissionreport in February said he had failed to exercise propercontrol over the dealings with Iran.    His approval rating hovers at 50 pct.    Reagan said he was deeply disappointed by the Senate defeatbut "my efforts to control spending are not diminished."    Democratic leader Robert Byrd said "this isn't going to makeor break the president." REUTER&#3;

However, this upturn in the Thai crop is beingcountered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.    Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop couldbe close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similarproduction Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.    Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocksin September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used toboost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will notbe able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimatesCuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mlntonnes.    However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporterswith reduced availability, Man said.    Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallento 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time freemarket demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, whichhas left exporters chasing falling import requirements.    A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But thedifficult task of keeping production advances at bay stillremains, as at least one more season of production deficit isneeded to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks stilloverhanging the market, Man said.    The increasing cases of record production as a result ofrecord yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producersto strive for greater efficiency.    As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost ofproduction, sugar exporters may become more responsive toprices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.    Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission andsugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in thelevel of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fullycompensate producers when exporting on the world market.    Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugaris expected to remain in intervention, it added. REUTER&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, SPAIN REVISES ECONOMIC TARGETS FOR 1987, Spain has revised some of its maineconomic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of theeconomy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in itsmonthly bulletin.    Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against aprevious target of 3.5 pct.    Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the centralbank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing atan annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to fourpct if the government were to meet its five pct inflationtarget this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.    The forecast for private consumption growth remainsunchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revisedupwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.    Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected toincrease by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.    Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against thedollar and slack external demand.    Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spendinghas lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from anearlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.    The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast tofive pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts lastweek on whether this target could be maintained if wagesettlements continue to rise above the government's recommendedfive pct ceiling.    Unions and employers dispute the average wage increasesagreed so far this year.

reut2-012.sgm, BEGHIN-SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR, French sugar producer Beghin-Say is notcurrently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed intointervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded atthis week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-SayPresident Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters.    The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos onWednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders.    Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission hasstarted to move in the right direction, but said his companyhad no plans to change its decision to put sugar intointervention.    But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a finalagreement would be reached with the commission which wouldallow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention.    European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar intointervention to protest about export rebates which they say aretoo low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by thecommission on Wednesday, according to commission sources.    Under EC regulations, however, operators have another fourto five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention beforepayment is made for it.    A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnesof West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, tradesources said here. This amount represents about a third ofannual EC exports to non-EC countries.    Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it hadoffered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000tonnes.    Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus onevery 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fullybridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebatewas 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get anequivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traderssaid.    Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates tothe full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was astep in the right direction.    Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorisedfor export since the begining of the current campaign had beeninadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate.    Trade sources said new regulations governing exportrebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth thepath for the commission to award larger export rebates infuture.    One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemedthe commission had understood the protest action and was nowmoving towards adapting the situation accordingly, therebyallowing the operators to withdraw their sugar fromintervention once they got satisfaction.

reut2-012.sgm, STOLTENBERG SAYS PARIS ACCORD POLICY TO CONTINUE, West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris inFebruary had been successful and would be continued.    Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week'sInternational Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: "The ...Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels hasproven its worth and will also determine future developments."    Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what hewould consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollararound 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports.    Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations hadmade it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan majorefforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreigntrade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy.    "No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, theU.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strongunder-valuation," he said.    Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in aswift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning thecurrent trade dispute over semi-conductors.    Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Pariscurrency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically butnoted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had notbeen published.    The Paris declaration did not state the levels at whichcentral banks of the major industrialised countries wouldintervene.    Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefullyconsidered. He said he had nothing further to add.    Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany wasnow no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government tostimulate its economy.    He declined to respond specifically to a question on thissubject but said, "You must attach particular importance to theconsensus which was reached in Paris."    The minister nevertheless added that he would make clearduring his trip to Washington that West Germany's nominal tradefigures gave a false impression about actual trade flows.    Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn's exports fell by anominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct.West Germany's imports dropped largely because of foreigncurrency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to arecord trade surplus last year.    However, Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany'sexports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real importshad risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct.    In this way West Germany had made its contribution toeconomic stability, Stoltenberg added.    Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to riseby a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating.    He said it was too early to revise official forecasts forWest Germany's economic growth this year. The government hasforecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product.    The Kiel Institute, a leading research body, is stillexpecting growth of three pct but some other researchinstitutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct.Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how manyimponderables had to be taken into account and said no drasticchanges in official forecasts were needed.

Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>,told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the maindangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar aswell as crude oil and commodity prices.    Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harmingearnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at thestart of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.    The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, wasbadly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover wasmainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.    Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 andcompetition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings fromlower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by pricecompetition and increased costs.    Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemicalfirms were slightly worse than the year before but the improvedfinancial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,neutralized the negative impact.    Strenger said the industry would try to increase productionin the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out ofWest Germany.    The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall inexports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.    Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far Eastexports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.

reut2-012.sgm, U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE, The departure of James Baker'sclosest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, willnot change the course of Washington's domestic andinternational economic policies, U.S. officials said.    Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, waswidely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives oncurrency management and international economic cooperation.    U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role inshepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan throughthe U.S. Congress.    But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure,to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers,signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the TreasurySecretary himself might leave soon.    "It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as itcame up," one official said.    Another commented, "Baker will miss him, but he's not goingto stand in his way."    There has been widespread speculation since last autumnthat Darman sought a Wall Street job.    Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform latelast year marked an appropriate moment to bow out.    Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed.    "Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of thisadministration over the past six years and his departurerepresents a substantial loss," he said.    U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be anundoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policyadvice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term,at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as"indispensable" to Baker.    Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currencysystem and Darman is generally credited by officials of othernations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouringtarget zones to limit currency fluctuations.    Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasuryunsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system.    But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, withDarman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives.    Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council,spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating withthe Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before.    Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as apolitical strategist "and that's Baker's strength too," theofficial said.    There were already indications that Baker, who throughouthis time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle ofadvisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor.    One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould,who holds the number three Treasury position ofUnder-Secretary.    Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years.    Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was apartner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerlyheaded Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.    The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annualmeetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated.    He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement,when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britaincurbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turningpoint in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economiccooperation and intervention in currency markets.    Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, likethe Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination ofeconomic policies among the leading industrial countries andthe recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies andstimulate global growth.    These policies are collectively aimed at redressing thehuge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses andthe United State's massive trade deficit.    That policy goal still remains a prime objective of theReagan Administration and will not change with Darman'sdeparture. REUTER&#3;

The electricity company, which supplies about 90 pct ofSouth Africa's power, said in its annual report that it failedto attract any foreign loans in 1986, but it was confident ofmeeting its funding requirements this year, despite availablefinance from abroad remaining restricted.    The utility, which once was South Africa's largest borrowerof foreign funds, said prearranged import financing facilitiesare expected to provide foreign funds of only about 300 mlnrand this year. A further 550 mln rand will be borrowed from ablocked account administered by the South African governmentfor the eventual repayment of about 13 billion rand inshort-term loans.    These are currently frozen by an effective moratorium onrepayments. The blocked account is part of a debt accordrecently reached with South Africa's foreign creditor banks.    South Africa declared a moratorium on repayments of about14 billion dlrs of its original 24 billion dlr total foreigndebt in September 1985 after foreign bankers abruptly cut offcredit lines to the country because of concern over itsdeteriorating political and economic climate.    Pretoria last week announced that it had reached athree-year rescheduling agreement with the major internationalcreditors that will effectively extend a moratorium on mostrepayments of the short-term portion of the debt untilmid-1990.    Escom said it plans to meet the bulk of its fundingrequirements this year by raising 2.2 billion rand in the SouthAfrican financial markets against a total of 1.75 billion randraised last year.    "The borrowing programme for 1987 is well within thecapacity of the (domestic) financial markets, without pressurebeing placed on interest rates," the corporation said.    "Last year we embarked on the most dramatic restructuringprogramme ever attempted by a major South African business, andwe have largely achieved what we set out to do," Escom chairman,John Maree, told a news conference.

reut2-012.sgm, EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT, European Community finance ministersand central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discussstrengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuingworries about turbulence on foreign exchanges.    Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host theinformal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bankchiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in thelight of the February agreement among leading industrialisedcountries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels.    In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accordbetween the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britainand Canada had proved itself "more or less workable."    But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have beengrowing since fears of a trade war between the United Statesand Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to arecord low against the surging yen early this week.    The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being heldto coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and ThirdWorld debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week.    The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the maindiscussions will take place tomorrow.    Continued international currency turbulence could undermineplans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the jointfloat holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuationbands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda.    Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period ofcalm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stabledollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to makeit more resilient against exchange rate swings.    The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year asthe falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMScurrency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertaketwo major realignments of parities within nine months.    In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for awide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMSon the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by theEC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central BankGovernors.    The committees were asked to come up with the proposalsafter the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January.    Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, thefledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take overthe mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has metwith a cool response in West Germany.    He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would reportto the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalisecapital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, suchas the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls.    Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements withoutstrengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation inthe Community.     He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether memberstates were willing to push further towards the EC's goal ofmonetary integration on the basis of an EMS that includedmanagement of exchange rates by some kind of commoninstitution, instead of by national central banks as atpresent.    Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen bythe EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by thereluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove uptheir sovereignty in the monetary field.    EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusalso far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism. REUTER&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, TALKING POINT/SANTA FE SOUTHERN &lt;SFX>, Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may havemore difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off apossible takeover by Henley Group &lt;HENG>, which has accumulatedalmost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroadconglomerate, analysts said.    Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henleydisclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, butanalysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover isits intention.    Analysts also said the company has strong defenses thatwould easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problemscombining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatorylimbo.    Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that SantaFe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cashequivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over25 pct. "This gives them plenty of borrowing power," he said,which could be used against an unwanted suitor.    Henley Group's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wantsto take major positions in undervalued natural resourcecompanies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seekingan acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs.    Santa Fe officials don't appear concerned that Henley mightlaunch a takeover. "I would not characterize the atmospherearound here as one of concern," one Santa Fe executive saidabout Henley.    "I think it's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firmstrategy with Santa Fe," said Mark Hassenberg, who coversHenley for DLJ Securities.    Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe's land assets arelikely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe's effortsto merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo,sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeablefuture.    These realities, they said, support the Henley Group'sstatement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment.    The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcomingdifficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topekaand Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co.The merger would create the nation's second-longest railroad.    Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) deniedthe merger on anticompetitive grounds.    The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights tofour western railroads to meet the ICC's concerns and persuadeit to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle tomerge the lines.    "My guess is the commission will decide in three to sixweeks whether to reopen hearings," Fischer said.    "I believe they've made an effort to satisfy the ICC'sobjections," he said. "But in doing so they haven't pleasedeveryone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side,now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are setup."    If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it willtake six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and upto another year for the ICC to decide.    Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buybackprogram begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as ofFebruary 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, aspokesman said.    Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned byNorfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 andanother of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said.    James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fightoff the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the sharebuybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe'soptions, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake.    "It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as alow-risk, opportunistic investment," Voytko said.    "People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrsto 50 dlrs a share," said DLJ Securities' Hassenberg. "But I'mcertain that in Dingman's mind, the company is worth more thanthat in breakup value." Reuter&#3;
reut2-012.sgm, STOLTENBERG CALLS FOR NEW BRAZIL TALKS WITH BANKS, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg saidhe will advise Brazil to take up discussions with itscommercial bank creditors when he is in Washington for theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting next week.    He told a news conference ahead of the IMF talks thatdiscussions about developing country debt problems would playan important role on the agenda in Washington.    Stoltenberg noted that Brazil had agreed in January to worktogether with the banks but said this pledge had not yet beenfulfilled.    After Brazil imposed a moratorium on interest payments on68 billion dlrs worth of debt in February, Brazilian FinanceMinister Dilson Funaro sought to involve foreign governments inrescheduling talks with banks.    But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonrebuffed Funaro's bid and said commercial bank loans were amatter for banks and not governments. West German bankers alsosaid then that Brazil should seek an understanding with theIMF.    Stoltenberg said in Bonn today that he had already toldFunaro that the unilateral moratorium was a mistake.    Stoltenberg said that despite progress in some areas, thedebt problems of a whole range of countries had recently becomemore difficult.    He said flows from commercial banks had decreased markedlyand that the refusal of some highly indebted countries tofulfil their commitments to private creditors or with the IMFwas one reason for this.    He also said that when debtor countries came up with good,confidence-inspiring policies, commercial banks should reactwith more flexibility in interest structures, maturities andrescheduling.    Many debtor countries had realised that it was not possibleto mobilise capital flows, and especially direct investments,without such policies, Stoltenberg said. REUTER&#3;

Assistant banking commissioner K.K Wong told Reuters: "Thereare no special favours towards the Japanese...But because ofJapan's strong economy and currency, they easily meet ourrequirement on assets (14 billion U.S. Dlrs)."    The Japanese control the largest share of assets of thefinancial institutions here but incorporated elsewhere, with980.5 billion H.K. Dlrs at end-1986, or 57.5 pct of the total.    "Hong Kong authorities welcome Japanese banks," said HaruoKimura, assistant general manager of the Bank of Tokyo. "But theU.S. And Britain are unhappy with the slow liberalisation ofthe Tokyo financial market."    Japanese bankers said Hong Kong offers good businessopportunities, especially in China trade, to Japanese banks whoare following their clients' international expansion.    "As their clients become more international, they have tokeep up and follow them," said Yutaka Toda, Dai-Ichi KangyoBank's general manager here.    "We can have access to local traders and regionalcorporations," said Bank of Tokyo's Kimura. "We can also pick upbusiness with China."    Bankers said more Japanese banks are on the way. An influxof Japanese banks began in the late 1970s when the governmentlifted a moratorium on new licences. But newcomers are allowedone branch each and only the Bank of Tokyo, Sanwa Bank andSumitomo Bank have more than one branch.    Because of this limitation, Japanese banks have mostlyconcentrated on wholesale business.    "It is very difficult to compete with those giants such asthe Hongkong Bank and the Bank of China," said Kimura of theBank of Tokyo.    Bank of Tokyo has the largest Japanese bank network herewith seven branches, while Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corpand the Bank of China groups each have hundreds of branches.    To broaden their client and deposit base, some Japanesebanks have taken equity in local banks. The latest such movewas Dai-Ichi Kangyo's increase of its stake in Chekiang FirstBank last year to 95 pct from 33 pct.    Tokai Bank, Fuji Bank and Mitsubishi Bank also haveinterests in small local banks.    But Mitsubishi, not content with its single-branch licenceand a 25 pct stake in the small Liu Chong Hing Bank, boughtMercantile Bank Ltd's multi-branch licence early this year.    "We will open one more branch in (Hong Kong's district of)Kowloon soon, to better serve our clients on the other side ofthe harbour," said Mitsubishi Bank general manager TakeshiTange.    Their weakness in the retail market forces Japanese banksto rely on the interbank market for funding.    Government data show that despite their large share oftotal assets, Japanese banks had only 54.4 billion dlrs indeposits at end-1986, or 17.1 pct of deposits of banks in HongKong incorporated elsewhere.    "Most Japanese banks' international lendings in the regionare booked in Hong Kong," said a Japanese banker who declined tobe named.    He said it is mainly for tax reasons, adding that assetssuch as loans booked in Hong Kong are not subject to Japanesetax.    Japanese banks are barred by the Tokyo government fromissuing Eurobonds, but their Hong Kong subsidiaries can tap theEuromarket and lend the funds to the parent.    Bankers said this role could be undermined by a five pctcapital adequacy ratio that goes into effect next year,requiring many DTC's to increase their capital. Many Japanesebanks are seeking special treatment for their largely offshoreoperations or a different risk calculation for their assets.    "I don't think this will stop them from coming here," said abanker. "But it may mean they have to conduct some of theiroffshore funding operations elsewhere." REUTER&#3;

"No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, theU.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strongunder-valuation," he said.

reut2-012.sgm, BELGIAN BOURSE TAX MOVE BLOCKED IN CABINET, Finance Ministry proposals forabolishing bourse transaction taxes for non-residents have beenblocked in cabinet and will not be re-submitted for severalweeks, a Finance Ministry spokesman said.    Government sources said the blockage would also delay anannouncement of measures that would simplify the procedure fornon-residents to recoup the 25 pct withholding tax levied oninvestment income in Belgium.    Finance Minister Mark Eyskens told Reuters yesterday thathe hoped the cabinet would approve the bourse transaction taxproposals today.    Eyskens also said he would in the next few days announceplans to simplify and eventually stop the procedure for foreigninvestors to reclaim witholding tax.    Financial analysts said the current procedure is so slowthat it effectively acts as a barrier to foreign investment inBelgium, especially in the bond market.    They said the move to simplify it would be far moresignificant than the abolition for non-residents of the boursetransaction taxes. These are set at three rates -- 0.07 pct,0.14 pct and 0.35 pct -- according to the security transacted.    Government sources said abolition of the bourse taxes forforeign investors had been held up by concern in the cabinetover the budgetary impact of the move, put by the ministryspokesman at 125 mln francs a year.    The sources said it was likely that this proposal and plansto simplify the witholding tax procedure would now be submittedtogether to the cabinet in several weeks.    Eyskens said abolition of the transaction taxes fornon-residents would make Brussels one of the few stockexchanges in the world where foreign investors were notsubjected to such a tax. REUTER&#3;
reut2-012.sgm, IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS, Amid new concerns about inflation,interest rate increases and trade confrontations,finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discussa deteriorating global debt and economic situation.    The meetings, under the auspices of the InternationalMonetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates areturning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further,upsetting bond and stock markets.    Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the globaleconomy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continueto carry the burden of their growing debt without vast newassistance.    Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signsany new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury SecretaryJames Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.    The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil,which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs ofcommercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded bylaying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.    Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in avisit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out theadministration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses tothe very poorest states.    The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministersin detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly beembraced by the developing countries.    "There's interest on the part of some countries for lookingat the support of the special problems of the very poorestcountries, because their position is so extreme," a Reaganadministration official said.    He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.    The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debtinitiative, which called for new funding to help debtorcountries grow out of their problems.    The largest industrial countries have been attempting tocoordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling thedecline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and otherproblems.    At the same time, the industrial countries see littleevidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fundforecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.    The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked otherindustrial countries to stimulate their economies.    These issues directly affect the debt problem and theability of the debtor countries to grow out of theirdifficulties.    In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports ofdeveloping country, allowing them to earn critical foreignexchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit,running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing othersto import more from developing countries.    The discussions, from April six to 10, will bewide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to theimpact of development loans on the environment, according tomonetary sources.    The talks will include an examination of tradeprotectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reaganadministration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs onmicrochip products from Japan, the sources said.    The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financialmarkets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.    There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. chargesthat Japan has been selling computer chip products below fairmarket value and has kept its own market closed to imports,further undermining the international trading system.    At the same time, the ministers will discuss thefundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the exportmainstay of many developing countries.    The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- theUnited States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- willgather for the first time since their February talks in Paris,where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.    The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada forfurther debate on economic policy coordination.    As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such asJapan agreed to stimulate their economies, while Americasaid it would reduce its federal budget deficit.    Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to tohave a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank, strengthening the link between loans andeconomic policy changes in debtor nations.    Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take moreaccount of the environment when making loan for dams and otherprojects.    The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said thisissue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganizationplan for the Bank, now being prepared. Reuter&#3;

At the same time its foreign liabilities rose 100 mln to22.8 billion, producing a rise in net reserves of 200 mln to82.2 billion on March 31.    The Bundesbank provided banks with liquidity in the fourthMarch week by disbursing funds in the money market viagovernment-owned banks. Banks took up the Bundesbank's standingoffer of treasury bills to place excess liquidity.    Banks received more liquidity through routine month-endpayments by public authorities as well as expansionary marketfactors than was lost through the 2.3 billion mark rise in cashin circulation to 122.3 billion, the Bundesbank said.    But banks had to draw heavily on the Lombard emergencyfinancing facility due to month-end tightness, borrowing 5.3billion marks.    Overall, banks' holdings at the Bundesbank rose 10.2billion marks to 58.5 billion at the end of the month,averaging 50.9 billion in the whole of March.    The minimum reserve requirement for March, before deductionof banks' cash holdings, was set at 61 billion marks.    Public authorities' net holdings at the Bundesbank fell to2.2 billion marks in the last March week from 4.4 billion theweek before. The federal states' holdings fell 2.6 billion to2.4 billion.

reut2-012.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TOKYO HARD ON FOREIGN TRADERS, Overseas securities firms are spendingmillions of dollars to set up operations in Tokyo, but manywill end up losing money, industry sources said.    For banks and securities firms eager to establishthemselves as international players, building a presence inJapan has become an imperative. Thirty-six are already licensedto trade securities on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world'ssecond largest. More than 50 are expected by year-end.    But, as deregulation erodes brokers' profits and the globalshare-buying spree is predicted to subside, only thosesecurities traders with first-class financial muscle willsurvive, the sources said.    "There will be foreigners' fallout. They come in here withtoo glib ideas about how they can survive," said David Miller,director and general manager of Jardine Fleming (Securities)Ltd's Tokyo branch.    Despite soaring share prices, sharp falls in commissions onstock transactions have hurt even brokerages that came to Tokyoearly.    "Japanese equities are no longer a very profitable business.The margins are nothing like they were two or three years ago.Things are not as rosy as they may seem," Miller said.    Publicly reported earnings of foreign securities houses inJapan for the half-year ended September 30, 1986, showedSalomon Brothers Asia Ltd on top with profits of 1.7 billionyen. Most other firms reported hefty gains over the yearbefore. But industry sources say the figures do not fullyreveal the costs of running an international brokerage in theworld's most expensive city.    Salary packages with free housing for novice analystsroutinely run more than 100,000 dlrs a year. Miller, whose firmhad earnings of 1.4 billion yen for the half-year to September1986, said costs for an operation strong enough to endure are10 to 15 mln dlrs a year. "I'd be surprised if more than two orthree were making money if they honestly accounted for theircosts," he said.    To bring commissions closer to world rates, the FinanceMinistry slashed fixed brokerage fees last year, especially onlarge-lot deals. In a few years, all rates may be negotiated asthey are in New York and London, industry sources said.    Since last October's Big Bang deregulation of London'sfinancial markets, at least half the equity trading deals therehave generated no commission income at all. Stockbroking firmsare unlikely to make money until some are forced out ofbusiness, analysts said.    The first foreign firms to set up here, especially the sixadmitted as members in February 1986, have an advantage overthe latecomers, they said. The six are &lt;Merrill Lynch JapanInc>, &lt;Goldman Sachs International Corp>, &lt;Morgan StanleyInternational Inc>, &lt;Vickers Da Costa Ltd>, &lt;Jardine FlemingSecurities Ltd> and &lt;S.G. Warburg and Co (Japan) Ltd>.    The memberships, which cost about five mln dlrs, allowfirms to execute their own trades and, unlike houses withbranch status, avoid paying away 27 pct of their commissions tohave member firms place trades.    Members can also communicate instantly with the exchangefloor, a vital source of information in a market that tends tofollow the leader. Sources said seven to 10 more seats on theexchange are likely to open up sometime in 1988.    For non-member firms, wrestling away market share fromtenacious Japanese and foreign firms is costly and intangiblessometimes prove even more important than exchange membership.    "Your name is better known if you're a member of the rightclub," Miller said. "It's easier to hire ... New people."    To inaugurate its Japan operation, &lt;SBCI Securities (Asia)Ltd> flew out the Basel Ballet last January for receptions inTokyo and Osaka. The firm, 50 pct owned by &lt;Swiss Bank Corp>,gave guests gifts of Swiss chocolates and Swatch watches.    "It's expensive, but a party like that is a token of theserious way we regard our development in Tokyo," SBCI's Tokyobranch manager Gregory Shenkman said.    To establish its position quickly, SBCI hired a 26-strongresearch unit from &lt;W.I. Carr (Overseas) Ltd>'s Tokyo office.    "I was very lucky," Shenkman said. "I was anticipating aconsiderable struggle to organically develop a research team.    "I am not particularly optimistic for the prospects in theJapanese equity market for continental European banks who havelittle experience in equities outside their domestic equitymarket," he said.    But the prospect of closing down operations may be worse.    "One would be ill-advised to open here and close, and thendecide to open again two or three years later. I'm not sure theJapansese community would respond well to that sort ofattitude," he said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH, Dutch dairy and general foodsmanufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV &lt;WESS.AS>, said it isplanning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strongprofit growth over the next 10 years.     Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at thepresentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987first quarter profits to show an increase.    The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.    This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar'sguilder value, van Driel said.    Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guildershigher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985level of 3.20 guilders.    Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mlnguilders down because of the lower dollar and lower rawmaterial prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.    US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover,compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separatebusinesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.    Van Driel said the company would continue an activetakeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying morethan its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.    He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisitionpossibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.    He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mlnguilders and would if necessary make new share issues.    Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mlndlrs. He said &lt;Balanced Foods> and &lt;Green's Dairy>, taken overlate last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrswhich was not included in the 1986 account.    All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key tothis growth was the successful introduction of new products,which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented USacquisitions, van Driel said.    Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.    The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich,Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims tobe quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.    Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not beaccompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehiclesfor the company to raise capital for future expansion.    He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were inforeign hands.    The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made alisting on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step,van Driel said without elaborating.    Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which producesaround 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospectsfor its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-012.sgm, CHINA PUTS BRAKE ON KEY REFORM GOAL, Fear of social instability and inflationhas forced China to put the brakes on one of its most importanteconomic reforms -- overhauling a pricing system which oftenbears no relation to production costs.    The price clampdown has occurred during a conservativebacklash following the resignation in January of reformistCommunist Party leader Hu Yaobang, Western diplomats andChinese sources say.    "In recent years, prices have not only been rising, but therate of increase is getting faster and faster," the People'sDaily said in a major article this week. "In future, pricechanges should be only in small steps."    Despite pledges last year that price changes were essentialto get the economy on the right track, the government hasrepeatedly said no major change will happen this year.    "Price changes in the last two years have aroused greatpublic discontent, especially in the cities," a Western diplomatsaid.    "Chinese were used to stable prices for 30 years from 1949when the Communists took over. On a recent visit to two majorcities, the refrain from all the officials was the need topreserve social stability," he said.    A Chinese journalist said the reformers had underestimatedthe extent to which the public would tolerate price changes.    "A major review of all economic reforms is under way, thebiggest since the reforms began in 1979, because many thingsare not going well -- a large budget deficit, too rapid priceincreases and no major improvement in productivity of statefirms," he said.    The reformers think it vital to change a system under whichprices often bear no relation to production costs.    Sugar is an example. An official newspaper said earlierthis year that more than 40 pct of China's sugar mills werelosing money or had closed because producing sugar was sounprofitable.    This was because the selling price of sugar has not changedfor 20 years, while the mills' production costs have risensharply over the period.    The economic masterplan for the 1986-90 period, publishedin April last year, said China would "work steadily to establisha pricing system which better reflects value and the relationbetween supply and demand."    The People's Daily said that in recent years wage increaseshad been too high and too much currency printed, resulting intoo much money chasing too few goods and causing price hikesand inflation.    The review of the reforms coincides with a nationalcampaign against "bourgeois liberalism," meaning Westernpolitical ideas blamed for causing student protests lastDecember.    The journalist said the review was in part due to politicalfactors.    "Economics and politics are inseparable in China. But theWestern media is wrong to classify the leadership intoreformers and conservatives. All the leaders agree on the maindirection -- economic reform and the open-door," he said.    "But there are differences of opinion on the pace of reformand on specific policies. No one is advocating a return to howthings were before 1979."    The diplomat said what China feared as a backlash againstprice rises was not so much rioting in the streets, which hesaid it had the means to control. "The bottom line is how suchprotests would be used by those in the power struggle."    A foreign lawyer said he believed the cause of the crisisearlier this year was that the Communist Party leadership hadfeared, due to the student demonstrations, that it was losingcontrol.    "The leadership here is a self-perpetuating oligarchy. Thereis no way that it is going to give up power," he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER, Pakistan is not emerging as a majorwheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to thePakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.    No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so andplans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothingbecause they could not agree a price, he said.    Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surplusesof one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next fewharvests in years when the weather is favourable.    The government does not wish to increase output much abovethis because of low world prices, and the land would be betterused for other crops.    Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sownto wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched tomore profitable crops such as oilseeds.    The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from thecurrent 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per haover the next five to seven years, he said.    Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which isjust beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mlntonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year'syield of 14.0 mln.    He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but morerecent rains reduced prospects slightly.    The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mlntonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annualpopulation growth rate of more than three pct. Currentconsumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.    The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mlntonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a"strategic reserve" target of two mln tonnes.    Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes overtarget, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.    The government wants to keep an extra "safety margin" untilit sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheatrationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exportswill be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88crop can be gauged as well, he said.    The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for thegovernment to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at tworupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price inPakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.    Under the old system, introduced during World War Two anddue to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards wereissued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.    Aziz said following the introduction of a governmentsupport price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted thatonly 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching theconsumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.    The ration system had also not had the stabilising effecton the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.    Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction ofthe new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensivePakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.    Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have amajor effect on total consumption, but it may encourage betteruse of side-products such as bran. Reuter&#3;

Arnold Lippa, Praxis' president, said Praxis will test thedrug in a few hundred patients with full-blown AIDS, in thosewith AIDS-related complex, a precursor to AIDS, and in morepatients with swollen lymph glands but no other AIDS symptoms.    Praxis reported a net loss of 2,186,000 dlrs for the yearended June 30, 1986. Lippa said the firm has about two mln dlrsleft from its public offering in January 1985.    But Lippa expects to "easily spend" five to 10 mln dlrs inthese new clinical trials. He said the Beverly-Hills,Calif.-based company is preparing a private offering anddiscussing ventures with other pharmaceutical firms to helpfinance the cost of the trials.    As another mark of the interest in AL721, Anthony S. Fauci,who heads the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDisease, said the government will begin testing AL721 in itsAIDS treatment evaluation units in June.    A spokeswoman said the study will be "small" and willestablish the drug's toxicity. She said the study will be"expedited" to allow the next phase of testing to proceedrapidly.    These plans follow the completion of a small-scale test ofthe drug's effectiveness in eight patients with AIDS-relatedlymphadenopathy--swollen lymph glands, at St. Lukes/RooseveltHospital in New York, and another study of 14 AIDS patients inIsrael, where the drug was developed.

reut2-012.sgm, ABNORMAL RADIATION FOUND IN SOVIET TEA/HAZELNUTS, Abnormally high levels of radiation werefound in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months afterthe Chernobyl nuclear accident, West German residents in Moscowwere advised this week.    In a letter to the West German community here, AmbassadorJoerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought inMoscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and-137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts.    Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University,including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, werefound to be free of radiation, it said.    Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts containedcaesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by theUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).    The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced noparticular health danger as most of the caesium remained in thetea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts.    The products sent for testing were bought in state shopsand private farmers' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Westernembassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratorytesting of Soviet food late last year because no abnormalradiation levels were detected.    "We didn't find anything so we stopped doing it," a U.S.Embassy spokesman said.    A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipmentremained in the embassy waiting room for British residents inMoscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests hadnot been conducted for several months.    "Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as aprecautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of anyalarming signals," he said.

reut2-012.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EFTA FEARS EC MARKET PLANS, The European Community wants to eliminateall obstacles to free movement of goods, services and people by1992, a laudable goal that has sent shivers down the spines ofits closest trading neighbours.    Europe's outsiders -- the six members of the European FreeTrade Association (EFTA), and other small states -- fear thegrowing power of the 12 EC member countries, a market of 320mln people, one and a half times as big as the whole U.S.    And as the Community celebrates its 30th anniversary, innon-EC countries from Ankara to Oslo, an attitude is emergingwhich says, "If you can't beat them, join them."    In June 1985, the Community adopted a plan to create an"internal market" without restrictions, which included new goalson everything from tourism to the rules of bank accounting.    The plan is so extensive that even the EFTA countries --Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland --with decades of close trade ties, find it hard to adopt a jointposition.    Last month Turkey formally requested EC membership,receiving a polite reply from Brussels that the time was notripe.    In Austria, where its 1955 charter of neutrality forbidsjoining political alliances, the government is looking for waysto become a "de facto" EC member.    And in Norway, where membership was rejected in a 1972referendum, government officials are wondering whether thepolitical climate has changed.    But nowhere has the debate been more existential than inSwitzerland, which has resisted all alliances for 700 years.    The Swiss are a microcosm of Europe, living geographicallyin the very heart of Europe and speaking the languages of thethree big economies -- Germany, France and Italy.    Swiss neutrality, which has kept the country out of theUnited Nations and the International Monetary Fund, would seemto preclude membership in the Community, given the EC's looselink with the Western defence alliance NATO.    But an opinion poll late last year, held in theFrench-speaking part of the country, showed a majority favouredjoining the Community.    Since then, government officials have stressed that, whilemembership was impossible, Switzerland should do everythingpossible not to be locked out when the trade barriers insidethe EC come down.    State secretary for foreign trade Franz Blankart, said itis inconceivable the whole Swiss nation -- including the moreconservative German-speaking majority -- would vote formembership.    But Switzerland must be more than just a "satellite," hesaid, now that the enlarged Community is extending itself intoareas omitted by the founding Treaty of Rome.    These areas, including pharmaceutical research andtechnological development, are the key to the economic futureof Switzerland and the Community alike, he adds.    "We cannot permit ourselves the luxury of passivelyfollowing the Community's new dynamic of integration," he says.    The Swiss economy ministry has drawn up a detailed analysisof the EC White Paper on the internal market, outlining theSwiss response to each point. While some refer to a collectiveEFTA stance, officials admit that on many issues Switzerlandmay have act alone.    The new EC plans on transport, for example, would have asevere impact on Switzerland and Austria, whose roads carrymost of the traffic between Italy and its EC partners.    But rules such as the volume of petrol buses are allowed tocarry across a border have much less importance to Sweden orFinland.    Switzerland wants to work out ways to help people crossingits borders with West Germany, France and Italy. But it isafraid the liberal border controls Denmark, an EC member, haswith the non-EC Nordic countries might pose a threat tosecurity.   And pin the fields of banking and insurance -- the verylifeblood of Switzerland's service sector -- Swiss interestscould prove directly opposite to its EFTA partners with theirpppppppnarrow and tightly protected financial markets.    The biggest danger ahead, EFTA members have said, would bethat their divided interests might leave the EC free to setwhatever guidelines and standards it wanted and force them onother European states that wanted to trade.

reut2-012.sgm, TIME &lt;TL> 1987 EARNINGS MAY BE 4.25 DLRS SHARE, Time Inc's chief financial officer,Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is"comfortable" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earningswill be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share.    In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share,including a number of special items.    Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the specialitems and also removing the earnings of American Television andCommunications Corp &lt;ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in1986.    Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by thecable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directlyin CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs inTurner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest.    Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, aTurner Broadcasting spokesman said.    Bigelow said the company is continuing its previouslyannounced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares werepurchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of81 dlrs per share.    Bigelow said the company will always have a share buybackprogram in place whenever it believes it is a better long-terminvestment than starting or acquring a business. But he did notgive any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mlnshares already announced.       On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman andchief executive said the company is not interested in investingin over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at allareas in which it is currently engaged.    Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time.In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggestacquisition ever.    N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, saidthe company might be interested in a relatively small bookbusiness.    He said following the recent agreement for the sale ofHarper and Row to the News Corp Ltd &lt;NWS>, "there may be piecesthat Murdoch doesn't want," referring to News Corp chairmanRupert Murdoch.    Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale, Munrosaid it is a "delicate subject", and "we're looking at all theoptions." SAMI is a marketing information service for the foodindustry. Published reports have stated it could be worth asmuch as 500 mln dlrs.       Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added  subscriberslast year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of1987. However, he said, HBO's results in the quarter will bedown slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was aspecial gain in the HBO unit.    Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscribergrowth of 800,000 for last year.    He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits andhigher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in thetax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points.    Munro said the company does not plan to increase itsdividend.    Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of AmericanTelevision and Communications, said the unit is looking atgetting involved in the home shopping video area. "It would befoolish not to be a player there," he said.    He said the company had talks with Home Shopping NetworkInc &lt;HSN> prior to that company's public offering last year,but nothing came of the talks. Reuter&#3;

reut2-012.sgm, ITALY SETS BANK CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS, The Bank of Italy issued details of newbank capital adequacy requirements due to come into force inJune, in a central bank circular.    The Bank of Italy circular follows an interministerialcommittee decision last December to introduce minimum capitaladequacy requirements for banks.    The requirements, which formalise criteria already in use,comprise a risk-asset ratio applicable to banking operationsincluding foreign branches, and a gearing ratio which excludesbusiness of foreign branches.     The risk-asset ratio measures solvency, defined as abank's ability to meet all its liabilities through therealisation of its assets, while the second establishes theminimum capital a bank must hold relative to its size.    Specifically, total credits and off balance sheet items ofdomestic and foreign branches must not exceed an amountequivalent to 12.5 times the bank's capital, net of stakes heldin Italian banks. The gearing ratio limits total financialassets of domestic branches to 22.5 times capital, net ofstakes held in Italian banks.   The Bank of Italy said the requirements corresponded to arisk-asset ratio of eight pct and a gearing ratio of 4.4 pct.    For both ratios, the value of equity investments and stakesother than those in Italian banks will be deducted from thecapital multiple.    The total credit risk of an individual bank will becalcluated by assigning specific weights to the variouscategories of financial assets and off balance sheet assets.The weighting will be based essentially on credit risk and willnot take into account guarantees, other forms of risk transferor potential losses linked to exchange or interest rates.    The definition of capital on which the ratios will becalculated comprises shareholders' equity and disclosed legalreserves plus "general provisions having the character ofreserves." Own shares held in portfolio will be excluded.    The Bank of Italy said it would set more stringentindividual ratios for those banks running greater risksregarding items such as the quality, mobility and concentrationof assets, and to liquidity and management adequacy.    The new ratios will be applied to all banks operating inItaly.    Banks which are not in line with the requirements by June1987 "must correct their position in the shortest time possible,"the Bank of Italy said. A transition period would be allowedbut would not be more than four years.    Italian branches of foreign banks will be exempted from therisk ratio when the parent banks are already subject to similarratios but must comply with the gearing ratio.    The Bank of Italy said the introduction of capital ratiosaimed to further enhance capital adequacy at a time ofincreasing competitiveness and was a further step in bringingItaly into line with supervisory norms in other countries.

reut2-012.sgm, UK HOPES HOWARD'S TOKYO TRIP WILL EASE TENSIONS, Britain and Japan remained deadlockedtoday over trade policies, and political sources said the U.K.Government was pinning hopes for a breakthrough on the trip toTokyo next week by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard.    Howard told Reuters he would try to "promote understandingon trade issues" during his trip, which starts tomorrow.    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japan'sprime minister promising his personal help for a solution tothe row over a U.K. Firm's bid to win a significant role inJapan's liberalised telecommunications market, governmentsources said.    Tensions have risen following the decision by Britain toarm itself early with new statutory powers which it says couldbe used against certain Japanese financial insitutions.    Britain had reacted optimistically at first to the letterfrom Japanese leader Yasuhiro Nakasone to U.K. Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher. It had been seen as a signal that he wouldwork towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bidlaunched by Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, officials said.    But this view has been clouded by reports from Tokyo thatNakasone's assurances really constituted little more thanpoliteness in the face of loud British anger, they added.    Howard said he would use his trip to push for a bigger rolein Japan's telecommunications industry for Cable and WirelessPlc. The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case forJapan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outsidecompetition.    Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection ofattempts by Britain to achieve that, Howard said "I am not sureit is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection ofMrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking apersonal interest in this problem."    "I don't understand it to be closed at all."    During his visit to Tokyo, Howard said "I shall be talkingto them about it (the letter), finding out exactly what they domean about it, and making it plain that we take a very seriousview of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not as freeas we allow acces to our markets to be."    He noted that under the new Financial Services Act, Britaincould revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insuranceinstitutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to get receivesimilar treatment in financial markets in Japan soon.    "I hope it won't come to that, and I don't think it will,"Howard added.    Officials involved in Howard's Tokyo itinerary said theyhad tried to arrange meetings with Japanese officials who wereleast likely to see trade issues in too a parochial a light. Reuter&#3;
reut2-012.sgm, USDA CORRECTS TURKEY CREDIT ANNOUNCEMENT, The U.S. Agriculture Department saidan announcement by the department yesterday concerning 15.0 mlndlrs in additional credit guarantees for exports of U.S.commodities to Turkey contained two inaccuracies.    First, the USDA said its announcement should not have saidthat plywood was excluded from the additional three mln dlrs inGSM-102 credit guarantees for lumber.    The original announcement said the guarantees includedthree mln dlrs for lumber, except plywood.    Melvin Sims, USDA general sales manager, told Reuters hedid not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales,but that "it's possible it would be."    Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102credit guarantees because it is considered by some to be amanufactured product. Members states of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development have pledged not to offerconcessional credits on manufactured products, Sims said.    However, the Reagan administration is considering whetherto allow plywood sales to be covered by the credit guaranteeprogram, Sims said.    Second, the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of apreviously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102was available for both public and private sector importers.

reut2-012.sgm, EXCHANGE SEEN APPROVING "WHEN ISSUED" GILT TRADE, The Stock Exchange is virtually certainto agree to change its regulations in order to permit "whenissued" trading of U.K. Government bonds (gilts) as part of anexperimental series of bond auctions later this year, marketsources said.    "The principle that this "when issued' trading should takeplace has been accepted by the Executive Committee of theInternational Stock Exchange," said George Nissen, chairman ofthe Gilt Edged Market Makers' Association (GEMMA). "It's aquestion of how, rather than whether," he told Reuters.    The Bank of England announced in February that it planned apossible series of experimental auctions for gilts, similar tothe system used to market U.S. Treasury issues, with the firstauction possibly in April or May.     The Bank said at that stage that it was not opposed inprinciple to "when issued" trading developing in bonds in theperiod between the announcement of full details of the auctionand the auction itself, as in the U.S.    However, "when issued" trading is prohibited under the rulesof the International Stock Exchange, formerly the London StockExchange, and would require an amendment in order to proceed.    Nissen said discussions on the technical details of a rulechange to allow "when issued" trading were still taking placebetween the Government broker at the Bank of England and theQuotations Department of the Stock Exchange.    The 27 gilt-edged primary dealers regard the introductionof grey market trading as an essential feature of an auctionsystem covering part of the Government's funding needs.    "If we are going into an auction system, we need to havesome form of market test of the stock we're bidding for," saidSimon Hartnell, Head Trader at primary dealer Alexanders Laingand Cruickshank Gilts Ltd.    "The American WI (when issued) market certainly functionsvery efficiently," he said.    Nissen said he believed that if "when issued" trading werenot allowed, market-makers "would be extremely unhappy about thewhole auction."    Gilt dealers noted that it was a basic provision of StockExchange rules that dealing could not take place in a stockuntil it was listed by the Quotations Department. However, thiswas mainly designed to prevent a grey market springing up inequities prior to listing.    They pointed out that in contrast to the many uncertaintiesconnected with an issue of equity securities, there would befew imponderables relating to bonds just about to be issued bythe Bank of England.    Senior market sources noted that in any case "when issued"trading would be supervised by the Stock Exchange and would besubject to Bank of England supervisory guidelines.    Since the Bank of England and market-makers themselves areknown to be in favour of the idea, the sources said, there wasnow a presumption that there would be scope for "when issued"trading to take place.    Gilt sales now are effected by means of large-scale stocktenders or by tap issues of stock tranches direct to themarket. But greater market capitalisation following the "BigBang" restructuring last year provided an opportunity forchange.    A combination of both systems would enable the Bank tobenefit from both the flexibility offered by traditionalmarketing methods and the guarantee of a steady supply of fundsimplied by auctions.    The Bank said in a consultative document published inFebruary that possibly two or three experimental auctions mighteach raise between one to 1-1/2 billion stg.    The remainder of the funding would be conducted bytraditional tender and tap issue means. Total gross officialsales of gilt-edged stock were 11.9 billion stg in 1985/86.    Nissen said that market-makers had agreed unanimously withthe bank's view that auctions would be more easily conducted ona price basis, rather than based on yield.    He said that the odds were also in favour of adoption of abid price form of auction, where successful bidders wereallotted stock at the various prices at which they bid, ratherthan a common price allotment whereby stock was allocated atthe lowest accepted price.    Hartnell said that while a "when issued" facility was crucialto market-makers' adaptation to the new system, he would alsohave liked to see an extension to the "fallow" period proposalmade by the Bank of England.    The Bank said that it would not sell by any method stock ofthe same type as that to be auctioned between the time of theannouncement of auction details and a period ending 28 daysafter the auction itself.    Noting that in the case of long bond auctions, U.S. Primarydealers have as much as three months between successive salesof stock, Hartnell said the Bank's proposal was "very tight."    Nissen said that following a meeting between GEMMA and theBank of England on March 3, which he described as "very helpful,"GEMMA submitted a note making several further residual points.    Market-makers are now awaiting a further, fairlydefinitive, paper from the Bank which would contain details ofauction procedures. Although the Bank has not yet formallyannounced a definite intention to proceed with the auctions,most market participants assume that they will go ahead.    "My own view is that we are on course and the firstindications from the original paper - an auction at the end ofApril or in May - must be the best assumption," he said. REUTER&#3;

The measure, which the administration opposes, would needHouse approval before any aid would be stopped.    Panama is due to receive 28.5 mln dlrs in U.S. aid thisyear.

reut2-012.sgm, EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND, The European Commission's decision torelease an additional 300,000 tonnes of British interventionfeed wheat for the home market will provide only moderaterelief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.    Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender themarket sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonneswere granted.    The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely tosatisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition forsupplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.    The release of the feed wheat followed recent strongrepresentations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage ininterior markets.    The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at theApril 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May andJune.    News of the release produced an early downward reaction inlocal physical markets, but by midday some sections had halvedearly two stg losses while others were unchanged.    Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mlntonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in thefree market. However, some traders believe these figures areoverstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, thebulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also offthe market in futures stores.    A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has beensold for export or to the home market since the season startedJuly 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59mln tonnes.    Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mlntonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.    This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed allearly expectations and has created the present nervoussituation in domestic markets where the fear now is free marketsupplies may not last out until new crop becomes available inAugust.    The market is sticking to its recent prediction of totalbarley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a newrecord and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnesachieved in the 1984/85 season.    Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln andbarley around 4.50 mln tonnes.    The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mlntonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traderssaid.    Other EC countries have bought large amounts of Britishgrain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mlntonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compareswith 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.    The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to staybuoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If suppliesbecome more difficult and prices strengthen further, feedcompounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said. Reuter&#3;

Total investment this year, the country's second as amember of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct,again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said.    It added that Portugal's current account was forecast toshow a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.    Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil andraw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar.    Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this yearand exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.    The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that thenon-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the currentgovernment would be maintained, particularly in budget spendingand income and in wage policy.    The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based onthe assumption that the international economic situation andPortugal's world trade relations would remain more or less thesame as in 1986.    The central bank said the high rate of investment estimatedfor 1986 was due to government policies and to increasingoptimism among firms whose financial situation had improvedsince 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year,especially in the construction and public works sectors.    Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boostinvestment last year, the bank said.

The studies covered a total of about 6,000 workers employedat the plant from 1948 through 1981.    Mortality rates from two other types of cancer, respiratorycancer and leukemia, had declined compared to earlier studies,the plastics and chemicals company said.    Potential causes and incidence of pancreatic, colon/rectal,prostate and bladder cancer will be studied further, a companyspokesman said.    The studies found elevated mortality rates from the fourcancer types. But the finding does not appear to be linked withproducts or processes at the plant, Rohm and Haas said.    The reports revealed no new evidence of health risk fromoperations at the plant, it added.    Respiratory cancer deaths among workers exposed to certainchemical operations before 1971 remain elevated but havedeclined from levels reported in 1974. And deaths from leukemiahave fallen to near normal levels from those reported in 1975.    A study completed in 1974 after an outbreak of respiratorycancer among employees linked the disease to exposure to acarcinogen, bischloromethyl ether, which is made at the plant.    The production of the chemical, an intermediary used inmaking industrial fluid cleaners, was isolated in 1971 soworkers were no longer exposed to it, the spokesman said.
