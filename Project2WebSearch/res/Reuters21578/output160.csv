He told reporters that volumes in North America increasedsome 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pctafter being flat for some years.    Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentratingactivities on core businesses, had now been completed, henoted.    But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategicacquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.    The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-taxprofits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level droppedthree pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.    Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc&lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring anyearnings dilution.    However, it would not add much to profits, with much of thecompany's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.    Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about40 pct by end-1987.    The same divergence was made in full year dividend, withUnilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and UnileverPlc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line withthe change in attributable profit.    Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts ofChesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he saidthat there was no target date for completing the process.    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped torealise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough hadpaid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, whichoperates outside Unilever's core activities.    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,considerable expansion in the household products business andin margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.

The official International Business newspaper todaypublished China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with thevisit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.    "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce itsrestrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilitiesfor them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chineseexports," the editorial said.    "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice againstfavourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit Chinainto the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).    "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports inrecent years, control of them is still extremely strict andinfluences normal trade between the two countries," it added.

reut2-001.sgm, KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS, The Kenyan economy is heading fordifficult times after a boom last year, and the country musttighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swingingtoo far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.    In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi saidhigh coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growthof five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.    The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance ofpayments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in1985, he added.    "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As aresult, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchangereserves during the year," he said.    The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreignexchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from apeak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.    Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs abarrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.    Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general declinein the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it moredifficult to finance the government's budget deficit.    Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget onservicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter ofcapital for the first time in its history, he added.    "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficultphase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative thatwe raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreignsources to finance our development," he said.    "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline onexpenditure ...

The company said information management products will bethe focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-businesscommunications campaign under the threme "The New Vision ofKodak."    Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company,Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded fourbillion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating thosesales were independent, that company would rank among the top100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out.    The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communicationscampaign, it added, is to inform others of the company'scommitment to the business and industrial sector.    Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on theinformation management systems unveilded today --    -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store morethan a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).    - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked informationmanagement system using optical disks or microfilm or both.    -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based systemthat allows users to integrate optical disks into their currentinformation management systems.    -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based,computer-assisted system which can be a starter system.    Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is awrite-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division willmarket on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in1988.    Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate upto 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytesof randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointedout, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.    Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies,including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media,fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected tosell in the 700,000 dlr range.    Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical diskversion which provides data storage and retrieval through adisk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing2.6 gigabytes.    Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member ofthe family of KIMS systems.

reut2-001.sgm, COFFEE TALKS COLLAPSE EASES NEED FOR U.S. BILL, The collapse of International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes theimmediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing thecustoms service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.    The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislationoffered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffeeimports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. Abill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).    However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reachagreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is notimmediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of thecoffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.    "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now)this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.

Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or"certs," will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16,Tom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA's stateand county operations, said.    The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certsratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will bedelayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computerprogram, von Garlem said.get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts incerts and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman).    Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments atsignup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than halfof this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he saidthis will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since mostfarmers got advance payments.    "The final certificate payments will be very close to 300mln dlrs," he said.    When asked if the Office of Management and Budget hadresisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that "weproposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it." Reuter&#3;
reut2-001.sgm, FORD CANADA &lt;FC> PROFIT DOWN ON CHANGEOVER COST, Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd,90 pct owned by Ford Motor Co &lt;F>, said the earlier reporteddecline in full year net profit was mainly due to changeoovercosts at its Essex, Ontario engine plant.    Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarterresults were due to improved cost recovery and lower productprogram costs, partially offset by lower engine production.    The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fellto 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarterprofit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prioryear.    Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadianoperations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0, while fourthquarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs inthe prior year.    Ford Canada reported a full year loss of 2.9 mln dlrs fromits overseas operations, compared to a 19.6 mln dlr profit in1985. Fourth quarter earnings from overseas operations rose to18.6 mln dlrs from a loss of 11.6 mln dlrs in the prior year.    The company reported full-year domestic sales in Canada of4.35 billion dlrs compared to 3.95 billion dlrs in 1985,excluding export sales to its U.S. parent.    Ford Canada said it had 1986 export sales to its parentcompany of 7.97 billion dlrs, up from year-earlier 7.18 billiondlrs.    The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mlndlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985.    The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarterresults from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies,cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery, which werepartially offset by lower industry volumes.    Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseasoperations resulted from lower industry volumes and increasedinterest costs, the company said.    Despite increased competition, Ford Canada's market shareof car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985, it said.The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct.    Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo carand Ford light truck, both manufactured in Oakville, which wereCanada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986. Reuter&#3;
reut2-001.sgm, FIRESTONE &lt;FIR> TO CLOSE THREE TIRE PLANTS, Firestone Tire and Rubber Co hasnotified the United Rubber Workers the company will close itsDes Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tireplants on or before September 15.    A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will becovered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the companytook in the fourth quarter of 1986.    The company said it was notified by the union March onethat the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma Citytire plant had been rejected by union members at the otherplants.     Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale ofits Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyersfor several months.    Those discussions are continuing, the company said, addingit could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing towork with any organization wishing to consider the purchase ofthe three tire plants, it added.    Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plantsin Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were beingdesignated as "distressed" under the terms of its masteragreement with the rubber workers.    Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with theleadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plansto reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefitsand work rules.    Union procedures, however, require approval by theFirestone section of the union's International PolicyCommittee, membrs of other locals covered by the mastercontract and by the rubber workers' executive board.    The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City packageby union locals at Des Moines and other locations and thelimited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural andoff-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to concludethe parties would be unable to reach agreements that wouldpermit the continued operation of the Des Moines andBloomington plants.

reut2-001.sgm, VENEZUELA PLANS NEW BORROWING WITH LIMITS, Venezuela will limit new loans to 50 pctof the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlrforeign debt, President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders.    Speaking last night at a new session of congress, he saidlast week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in publicsector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflectedVenezuela's improved credit image.    "Our priority is development, but I insist that there cannotbe development if we don't fulfil our obligations," he said.    Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisorycommittee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over liborfrom 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion.    "The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is amarker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs thisyear," Lusinchi said.    He said the country had been loyal to the principles of theCartagena group of Latin American debtors but had "decided toreach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case,because of the vulnerability of its economy."    Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord inFebruary, 1986, but immediately sought new terms because offalling oil income, which dropped 40 pct last year.    Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes tosign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter,but that in any case it would become effective from April 1.    Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have beencontacted with details of the new agreement, and that PublicFinances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres toround up support.    Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalisedwere the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and theoutlines of a government plan to allow public and privatesector debt capitalisation.    He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loansto Venezuela, a fundamental achievement in the new accord.    "Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will nowhave to define more precisely what projects can be financedfrom foreign borrowing," he said, adding that loans for steeland aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first tomaterialise.

He told a news conference that more options contracts weretraded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market'sexistence.    Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contractstraded in February this year almost tripled to 53,056 from19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growthwas expected.    "We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of1988," said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligibleconstituents of the FT-SE 100 share index.    Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to beintroduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc&lt;SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc &lt;PLYL.L> fromMarch 19.    The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the UnitedStates for options trading. Forty-five equity options, twocurrency options, two government bond (gilt) options and anoption on the FTSE-100 index are available at present.    Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidatethe London options market's leading position in Europe,especially important with French and Swiss equity optionstrading planned to start this year.    "I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth areconservative," one leading options analyst said, predictingcontinuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at leastthe next year.    He said much of the recent growth in options had come frominter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. Butnow the retail options market was beginning to take off.    The market trades from a corner of the now largely desertedfloor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been leftalmost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes inthe equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which haveencouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading.    Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor toequities trading altogether, and said it expected to make afinal decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987.    The floor space could be used for a purpose-built optionsmarket, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that theoptions market would need more than half of the availablespace. REUTER&#3;

"Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, anda solid capital position...combined with the restraint ofnon-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in theperiods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.    The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarterended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a yearago.    Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue tosubstantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank'sinternational operations remains weak, reflectingresource-related difficulties of private and public sectorborrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital marketactivities.    The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago whileearnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrsfrom 42 mln dlrs last year.    Royal Bank said first quarter international net interestincome declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenuesfrom international investment banking as well as a significantloss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.    Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs lastyear. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retaildeposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue butlower securities commissions from international investment bankoperations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.    The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth inconsumer lending, particularly residential mortgages. Reuter&#3;

De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textileimports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."    And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.    Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it wasvetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports toprotect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliationU.S. trading partners.    A similar bill has been introducted this year, in aCongress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a Presidentweakened by the Iran scandal.    De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials andCongressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way wecould react would be retaliation, and it would cause moreretaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems."    He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxeson a lot of American products."  He said "it would be stupid. Wehave to avoid that."    He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because ofits massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not withEC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted shipments of Asian textiles.

World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mlntonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higherif the Indian government did not artificially curb domesticdemand.    Oil World said it did not expect the European Community(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax wereintroduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption. Reuter&#3;
reut2-001.sgm, COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL, Coffee producing countries must quicklymap out a fresh common strategy following the failure of theInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement onexport quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's privatecoffee exporters' association, said.    Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing nowwould be to seek a unifying stand from producers, includingBrazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.    An ICO special meeting ended last night in London withexporting and consuming nations failing to agree on aresumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago afterprices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.    Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe butpredicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedlyplummet.    However, he said the market should also take into accountevident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of thenear totality of the Central American crop.    Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past10 years.    Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understandthe true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nationsas well as for industrialized countries.    It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made tosolve the problem of the developing world's external debt,decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repayingthose debts, he said.    "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that,while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countrieswhich support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,"Cardenas said.

reut2-001.sgm, TALKING POINT/AUTO SUPPLIER STOCKS, The 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales isclouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts whofollow the industry say it is also true for companies that sellparts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers.    But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakerswhose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousandsof big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original andreplacement parts.    Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are manyopportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry'sintensified competition and the large volume of production inNorth America planned by Japanese automakers.    But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicatedthan for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit BigThree - General Motors Corp &lt;GM>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> andChrysler Corp &lt;C>.    Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales willdecline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels, Wall Streetfinancial experts are still generally bullish on Ford andsomewhat less so on Chrysler.    And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM, theindustry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with itssales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitableparts-making businesses. more&#3;

Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reducesoybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.    At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from theEuropean Community and South America in the January/Marchquarter, with additional large quantities likely to be importedin the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, itsaid. No figures were given for imports in the correspondingperiods of 1986.    The change made sense in view of the recent purchases ofprobably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseedand large scale butter imports that were expected from Marchonward, it said.

He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be anumber of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan soughta tax increase to help balance the budget.    However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax ratesenacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.    There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.    Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general taxincreases.    On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect themajor trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industryfor special protection.

This apparently ruled out congressional approval of anothertextile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as wasproposed again this year. Reuter&#3;
reut2-001.sgm, AMR &lt;AMR> AIRCRAFT FINANCING SEEN POSITIVELY, The deal AMR Corp cut to buy 40 newplanes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts thefinancial burden on aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co &lt;BA> and&lt;Airbus Industrie>, a European consortium, analysts said.    "The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of themanufacturers," said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley andCo. "They're called walkaway leases."    AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbusbut said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft,which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers.    AMR declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated atroughly 2.4 billion dlrs. American Airlines will use theplanes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand itsservice in the Caribbean and to Europe.    But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for theplanes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases.The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-yearextension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 daysnotice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairmanRobert Crandall.    "We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms,"Crandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals "offbalance sheet" limited obligation leases, under which thefinancing is provided by the manufacturers.    A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms. "We will ownthe aircraft and they will be leasing them from us," he said.Airbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet,long-range A300-600 planes.    A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit ofBoeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are partof the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements.    Analysts said "walkaway lease" deals have been used beforeby airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations ofplanes, but not to this extent.    Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal willgive AMR financial stability as it grows. "AMR is using themanufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes andconsequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable intothe early 1990s," he said.    "The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines willincreasingly become operators of assets rather than owners" toreduce their exposure to risk, he added. Reuter&#3;

After some deterioration, the situation and prospects forJamaica improved substantially in 1986 and early 1987, mainlyas a result of a decline in energy prices and interest rates,and a strong recovery in the tourist sector, the IMF said.

"We have preliminarily determined that FSLIC needs to establish a contingent liability in the range of eight billiondlrs to handle cases that will require action in the nearfuture," Frederick Wolf of the GAO said.    "When that amount is deducted from FSLIC's reserves, FSLICwould have a deficit of over three billion dlrs as of the endof 1986. Clearly, FSLIC needs additional funds to resolve thelarge backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associationsthat continue to operate," Wolf said.    He urged the committee to support the Treasury Department'splan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalizeFSLIC.    Wolf said as of Septmember, 1986, about 85 pct of FSLICinsured savings associations were solvent, while 15 pct wereinsolvent.    He said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable,earning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first threequarters of the year, while the other 20 pct of associationslost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period.

The improvedoutlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 newplanes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.    "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," saidNicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangementsfor its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>twinjet long distance aircraft.    But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allowit to operate the aircraft without adding to its debtstructure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of theplanes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protectsAMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severedownturn in the economy.    From GE's point of view the package looks like a good dealfor several reasons, Heymann said.    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time ofdelivery, Heymann noted.    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planesGE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,would have little trouble rounding up another airline thatwanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the dealappears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.    GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares bymidafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Uphamand Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no oneorder will have much of an effect on the stock."    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said theorder "will help to maintain a good level of production andprofitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE.    Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet enginebusiness rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrsby 1991.    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs lastyear, with well over half of the business in the militarysector, according to analysts' estimates.    The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincideswith an upbeat performance in other segments.    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the firstquarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corpthat it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business andreshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with otherelements of its 14 business areas.    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the currentquarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by theNBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in partcrediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition." Reuter&#3;

The Rochester, N.Y.-based company unwrapped a series of newelectronic data and image storage systems that can create vastcomputerized libraries of documents and pictures.    Analysts said Kodak made a good start in the emergingmarket for such systems, sales of which are expected to reachfive billion dlrs by 1990. But they warned several years maypass before the new systems contribute to its bottom line.    Kodak also launched a 50 mln dlr advertising campaign topromote its new image. "We want to be to the imaging marketwhat IBM is to the data processing market," said Edgar J.Greco, vice president and general manager of Kodak's businessimaging systems division.    While more than 45 pct of Kodak's 11.55 billion dlrs insales for 1986 came from photography products, Kodak said salesof copiers, electronic storage systems and other businessproducts will exceed four billion dlrs this year.    "We're launching a major attack on these new markets,"Greco said.    "Kodak perceives that these new businesses will be itsbread and butter," said Wertheim and Co analyst Michael Ellman.    But Richard Schwarz, who follows Kodak for E.F. Hutton andCo, said the company will find the profit margins much slimmeron sophisticated imaging systems than on its consumerphotography products.

Woolworth Co, once known only as a five anddime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases forthe New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 yearsago.    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrsper share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrsper share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion comparedwith the prior year's 5.96 billion.    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters thatincome generated by the company's specialty store operationsaccounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty storesoperating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, itoperated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated byWoolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richmanapparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chainof discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discountdrug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, ofwhich 1,200 are in the United States.    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying asthey are an improvement over last year's record earnings."    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings ineach quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlierperiod.    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount storeindustry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworthopened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the UnitedStates, although Woolco still operates in Canada.    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy andannounced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square footthan general merchandise stores.    Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY, Canadian economic growth is expected toslow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture shouldkeep the country from recession, economists said.    "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growthover the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist atDominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.    Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,but down from 1985's four pct.    In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualizedrates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in thethird quarter.    "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin,deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.    Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt ThomsonBongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along verysteadily, it's not a very promising number."    "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarterin Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," sheadded.    The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast byFederal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget lastmonth. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct thisyear.    Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth willlikely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.    Statistics Canada also reported the country's tradeperformance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit inthe current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrsfrom the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.    "The sharp increase in the deficit originated frommerchandise trade transactions where imports continued toadvance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," thefederal agency said in a statement.    The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billiondlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.    But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, andhelp fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct ofCanada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year. Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, BANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSES LIMITS ON UNDERWRITERS, The Bank of England proposed that banksin Britain for the first time will have to seek authorizationto be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets.    In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount ofcredit risk that firms can take on with each new issue theylead manage.    The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultativepaper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks anddeposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said.    The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobondsecurities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs ofnew eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled byEuromoney magazine.    Up until now, there have been no restrictions on leadmanaging eurobond issues.    However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank ofEngland is concerned about intense competition for market sharewhich may have caused some firms to expose themselves toimprudent credit risk.    Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers asbanks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rulessuggest that some constraints may be placed on competition asregulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more riskthan it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank ofEngland is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing toaccept some constraints in order to ensure that underwritersact prudently.    "The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank'slead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skilland experience of the lead underwriter in the particular marketconcerned...," the Bank's proposal said.    Once a firm has received permission to act as leadunderwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of theface amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and itmust be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct ofcapital.    The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. Afterthat, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will beassessed at their full face value.    The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said.    The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthenits supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which calledfor comments from professionals by March 31 to allow theirpossible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its plannedfinal discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer.    The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is thethird leg of the Conservative government's legislation for thesupervision of financial institutions.    It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act,aimed to bolster investor protection, and the BuildingSocieties Act, which put these institutions on an equal footingwith banks.    The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions betweenrecognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legalcontrols, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.    Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England inadvance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of theircapital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.    However, preliminary consultations with bankrepresentatives had shown some of the initial proposals to beflawed, it said.    Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on acase-by-case basis rather than along general lines.    Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment ofexposures by financial institutions acting as banker to otherunits of their own group of companies, the paper showed.    They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure tolocal governments and other public sector entities, and ofexposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.    Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor ascollateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.    Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within theirown group of companies would usually be looked into on acase-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.    The paper said exposures to state-owned industries andother public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad shouldbe given the more lenient treatment of credits to governmentsprovided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.    It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities andthose guaranteed by the British Export Credit GuaranteeDepartment would probably not qualify for such treatment.    On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary ofanother bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceilingcould be exceeded in individual cases.    But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertakingto take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and statein writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary'sbalance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.    On collateral security, it said this "should normally onlybe taken into account when considering the acceptability of abank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base."    "The presence of security taken on its own will beconsidered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposurein excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptionalcircumstances and even then to a very limited extent," it said.

Reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in theWhite House briefing room that he was summoning Ambassador MaxKampelman and the other top U.S. arms negotiators home forconsultations later this week. He said they will then return toGeneva for detailed negotiations on the arms pact.    Welcoming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's offer Saturdayto proceed with a treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear forces(INF) separate from strategic and space weapons, Reagan said:"This removes a serious obstacle to progress towards INFreductions."    "To seize this new opportunity I have instructed ournegotiators to begin presentation of our draft INF treaty textat Geneva tomoorrow," Reagan said.    He said he wanted to stress that of the issues remaining tobe resolved in the negotiations on medium-range U.S. and Sovietmissiles, "none is more important than verification ... Anyagreement must be effectively verifiable."    The United States has been working closely with allies andfriends in Europe and Asia to develop a proposed treaty onreducing these weapons with an eye to their eventualelimination, the president said.     He said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreedupon with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last October inReykjavik, Iceland, which was shelved when the Soviet leaderinsisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement onlong-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense.    "I remain firmly committed to these objectives," he said.    He said Gorbachev's new offer Saturday ending the linkageof the three areas of negotiations removed a major barrier toagreement and was consistent with the Soviet position at theearlier Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva in November 1985.

Goodyear also paid him 37 mlndlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for overtwo billion dlrs.

reut2-001.sgm, SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE, Soviet winter grains could be off toa faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry falland cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.    Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in theSoviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature toforecast any major crop problems, analysts said.    But the situation bears careful watching over the next sixweeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply andfuture buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.    "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty thatthe Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have alower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologistfor E.F. Hutton said.    The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas willbe the crucial period that will determine the final outcome ofthe winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.    "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead ofus," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectaresof winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter cropand would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, theUSDA analyst said.    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be ableto reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analystsnoted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcovercombined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has beendue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.    "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlationbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said.    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normalin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over theentire winter crop area, she said.    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which thesnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, seniorforecaster for Accu Weather, said.    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of thefall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring wouldrequire longer off-pasture feeding, they said.    "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... theydon't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said.    But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops andif they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was aone-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Sovietbuying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.    Bad weather during the next six weeks could push theSoviets back into the market, weather analysts said.    "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month anda half," Martell said.

reut2-001.sgm, OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT, Crude oil prices rallied today, movingover 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determinedeffort to support prices, analysts said.    "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this withoutanother meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due toseasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attemptto get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount fromthe official prices agreed to last december.    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministersof the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at theCooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.    The Saudis have also offered to support members havingdifficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.    "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and toprevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPECmember will allocate some of their oil sales to help membersthat lose sales," Margoshes said.    He added that the allocations would probably be in the formof loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in linenations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But itis also likely that such assistance would be provided toNigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPECpresident Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPECmeeting for fear that it would give the appearance that theDecember pact is falling apart.    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, UphamHarris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have beenoversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a shortcovering rally."    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, whichrefused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refinersinto the market to cover their short positions.    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the marketto but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideastsours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after tradingyeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into theNorth sea crude oil market.    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors todaythat Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brentfor Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vesselsbeing fixed to make such shipments.    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with tradesreported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over theirquotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPECproduction was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to lastdecember but he gave no details on OPEC production againstclaims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.    "The production probably is about their quota level andlargely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sellits oil as a result," Margoshes said.    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of thecurrent rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise ifSaudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.    But others said that despite the rally today there werestill several fundamental factors, including demand, whichcould cut the rally short.    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, saidslow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keepdemand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to riseabout 1.4 pct over 1986.

reut2-001.sgm, COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS, Coffee prices may have to fall even lowerto bring exporting and importing countries once more round thenegotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates andtraders said.    The failure last night of International CoffeeOrganization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agreeexport quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffeefutures markets today with the London May price reaching a4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne beforeending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previousclose.    The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.    Pressure will now build up on producers returning from theICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hopethe negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floorunder prices, some senior traders said.    The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb forMarch 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 centsa lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended inFebruary last year following a sharp rise in internationalprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and saidthey need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failedat the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now itis time to go and sell coffee."    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plansto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop nextmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Tradesources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with aprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of publicselling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures marketlast year.    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to themarket "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months.    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a splitbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick forfuture quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like averageexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,Dauster said.    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation butconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" wayof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongstproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members andnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas andthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a setratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.    It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate"policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcometo participate they cannot dictate quotas which are verydifficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achievedifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICOand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared toaccept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it provesimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.    "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and toencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock ifsupplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said.    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumerargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICOsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapseand how much producers will sink their differences shouldprices fall further and remain depressed.    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 butboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if realnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet inIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces andpolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries couldbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner thanmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force duringthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas beforeOctober are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO hascontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.    A clear difference between the pressures already being feltby importers and exporters was that consumers would have beenhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it couldnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they couldshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug theseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these tolapse should lasting agreement not be found.    "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after theirfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficientand we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY BRAZIL SHOULD DEAL WITH BANKS, The U.S. is sticking for the momentto its policy that Brazil, which two weeks ago suspended debtpayments to private banks, should deal with its creditors andnot with governments, U.S. officials said.    "I don't see any desire here to scurry around and helpBrazil until we get a better sense of what they are trying todo," a senior administration official stated.    "Brazil has to do business through the banks at this point,"said another official following an assessment of that country'slatest debt crisis.    The official, who asked that his name not be used, said theNational Security Council, the Treasury and State departmentsand other agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss thesituation.    In a related development, small regional banks that havemade loans to Brazil and other heavily-indebted Latin Americancountries, will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volckerhere tomorrow.    Brazil, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked bankslate last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billiondlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems.    Brazil's trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchangehas dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to serviceits debt.    The official said the interagency meeting was called todiscuss "the general debt situation and compare notes on(Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro."    Funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a politicaldiscussion with industrialized nations on Brazil's debtproblems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending fromofficial sources, held discussions here on Friday with Volcker,Treasury Secretary James Baker and other officials.    Another senior administration official said he wasperplexed by Funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisiswith governments and not with creditor banks, at a time whenBrazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines.    "We are not clear at all on his tactics. To me it seemsbizarre, just bizarre," the official said.    One official today described Funaro's argument as "nonsense,"and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to Brazil,for which that country was in arrears.    Funaro has said Brazil acted to protect its reserves butwanted to avoid a confrontation.    The consensus among administration officials seems to bethat Brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domesticeconomic problems.    "Brazil is a special case, but there's no doubt they wouldnot be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up theireconomic policy," a senior official added.    Several of the regional banks that will meet with Volckertomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held atthe Fed's suggestion.    "Since they are the hosts, we feel it's up to them if theywant to say something," one regional bank official said.    But other banking sources said that regional banks, many ofwhich are refusing to continue lending to Latin America, aredissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as Citibank, inthe refinancing of foreign debts.    The sources added that Volcker, for his part, isdissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interestrate concessions to Brazil and other Latin American debtors,and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actverole in the rescheduling process.

In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Departmentsaid Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shownsharp gains to date.    The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably beaffected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, onwhether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S.have caused injury.    Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruitcoupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that growerprices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.    The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storageat the beginning of February were moderately larger than a yearearlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm.    In view of the strong demand and seasonally reducedsupplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.    During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processednoncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.    Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remainingsuppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as aconsequence prices have strengthened, the department said. Reuter&#3;

Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat whose committee is incharge of tax legislation, met this afternoon with HouseSpeaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, to discuss a variety oftax and budget issues, an aide said. He added that Wright didnot endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterdayas a possible way to cut the federal deficit.    The aide to Wright added that Wright asked the Ways andMeans Committee to look into the securities transfer tax.However, he said Wright had not recommended it as he hadanother tax proposal to hold income tax rates at the 1987 levelrather than allow the 1987 tax rate cut to take place.    Wright brought up a 0.5 pct tax on all sales and purchasesof publicly traded securities as a way to raise about 17billion dlrs a year, the aide said.    The New York Stock Exchange said it had not seen theproposal by the House Speaker but added that it is "stronglyopposed to any proposal to impose a transfer tax on securitiestransactions."    NYSE vice president Richard Torrenzano said in a statement,"Such a tax would be paid by millions of investors nationwideand would be counter-productive, making America's securitiesindustry vulnerable to foreign competition at a timewhen financial markets are becoming increasinglyinternational."

reut2-001.sgm, U.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS, Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs indeficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificatesand 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs andsorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.    Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject tothe 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudmanbudget deficit control act of 1985, it said.    Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiencypayments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.    The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 centsper bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum werereceived by producers requesting advance payments.    Deficiency payments are calculated as the differencebetween an established target price and the higher of the basicloan rate, or the national average price received by farmersduring the first five months of the marketing year --September-January.    National weighted average market prices for the first fivemonths of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers willbe paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.    Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 centsper bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs perbushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loanrate.    The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are themaximum permitted by law, the department said.    Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national averagemarket prices received by farmers during the entire marketingyear for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, thedepartment said.    The payments will be issued through local AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-001.sgm, PENNZOIL &lt;PZL> SAYS IT HAS MADE SETTLEMENT OFFERS, Pennzoil Co chairman J. Hugh Liedtkesaid the company has made several proposals to Texaco Inc &lt;TX> to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to Pennzoil andthat a settlement was "in the best interests of bothcompanies."    Liedtke, in a letter mailed today to Pennzoil shareholders,said Texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recentpublic statements that Pennzoil was not interested in settlingthe case.    "Pennzoil has made Texaco several proposals, both beforeand after trial, to settle this dispute," Liedtke said in theletter. "We do not know why Texaco's officials would now makesuch clearly untrue statements."    Last month, a Texas state appeals court upheld a juryjudgment that Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's planto acquire Getty Oil in 1983. The appeals court reduced by twobillion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awardedto Pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed thetotal amount back above 10 billion dlrs.    Pennzoil said that Texaco had made four unsatisfactoryproposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit.    "Other than to put on the record that it has made offers,Texaco's proposals make no sense," Liedtke said in the letter."In fact, two of Texaco's offers were identical and wereproposals that Texaco knew in advance Pennzoil would notaccept."    The letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers madeby either Pennzoil or Texaco.    "If and when Texaco's management changes its position anddemonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt tosettle this matter, Pennzoil will make every effort tocooperate," Liedtke said. "Such a solution, I believe, isclearly in the interests of both companies, even if it notattractive, as a personal matter, to Texaco's management anddirectors."    Liedtke said that cash flow from the Getty Oil assets andprofits from those assets that have since been sold"approximately equaled" Texaco's purchase price of 10 billiondlrs for Getty.

That ruling by the IRS allowed the Foundation, set up bythe late Conrad Hilton, to hold onto 27 pct of the Hilton Corp,worth approximately 164 mln dlrs, according to Hiltonattorneys.    Barron Hilton, Conrad's son, is making a bid to purchasethose 6,782,000 shares, the company said.    However, in an effort to hold onto the stock, theFoundation changed its tax status from a private foundation toa public support organization, freeing it from the constraintsof the excess business holdings limitations imposed on privatefoundations by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, according to theHilton Corp.    That act said that a private foundation could not own morethan 20 pct of a corporation, lawyers explained. Anything overthat figure had to be sold.    The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died, the lawrequired that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct ofthe common stock should be sold. Under Conrad Hilton's will,Barron had the option to buy the seven pct,  according to theHilton lawyers.    Now Hilton lawyers contend that through a clause in the taxlaw, Barron Hilton is entitled to buy the entire 27 pct blockof stock. The Hilton lawyers explained that Barron wasattempting to keep the large block from going public, leavingthe family in control of the corporation.    Reuter&#3;
reut2-001.sgm, AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA, The Australian Government will likelyreimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, thedepartment said the sharp fall in world wheat prices hasreduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levelsinsufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated ataround 98 dlrs per tonne.     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below thebreakeven export price, it said.    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advancepayment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculatedat 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the currentyear and the two lowest of the previous three years, thedepartment said.    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling andstorage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.    But the department said the Australian Bureau ofAgricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production willdrop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in1989/90.    The decline will result from low world grain prices leadingto shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.wheat exports, the department said. Reuter&#3;

The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows aperiod of severe droughts, which at one point required SouthAfrica to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, itsaid.    Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facingincreased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.    But if South Africa is perceived as lacking availablesupplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, thedepartment said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS, Chicago Board of trade grain traders andanalysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned tohandle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of newcrop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeansin the futures markets.    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers willbe more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans becausecorn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That givesdeficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if theysign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thingrather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new cropsoybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans moreattractive under normal circumstances.    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift thelimited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mlnmore oat acres this year than last without being penalized,traders said.    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking ofshifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to themore attractive deal from the government, they added.    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just sixmonths ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South toput soybean land back into cotton.    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybeanproduction in recent years has been a general shift of acres intraditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

reut2-001.sgm, GM &lt;GM> BUYBACK SEEN CALMING SHAREHOLDERS, Wall Street analysts said a sharerepurchase program announced by General Motors Corp is in partan attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recentrepurchase of shares from Texan H. Ross Perot last year.    "He (Perot) was obviously the big trigger" said analystJoseph Phillippi of E.F. Hutton Co. "There was a firestorm ofcriticism from people on the institutional side."    Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost theshares in the near term but some had reservations about thelong term effects of the plan.    "They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated bythe buyout of Ross Perot," said analyst David Healy of DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.    Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had beenhinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutionalinvestors. He said the plan, which could cost more than fivebillion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to Ford MotorCo's &lt;F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basisthan that of Chrysler Corp &lt;C>.    Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buyback stock on a large scale.    The General Motors plan, announced after a board ofdirectors meeting in New York, calls for repurchase of up to 20pct of the common stock by the end of 1990.    The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mlnclass E &lt;GME> and class H &lt;GMH> shares. GM shares closed at75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company'sannouncement. However subsequently Jefferies and Co, whichtrades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours, said it wasmaking a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78.    "The stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow," saidRonald Glantz, analyst at Montgomery Securities.    "I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is comingfrom unless they borrow," Glantz said. "Their credit rating isgoing to fall." GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotivecapital spending.    Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall bygoing ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked forclosing. After deciding against a profit sharing bonus forworkers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs "this will beseen as rubbing salt into the wound," Glantz said. "GM must bechallenging the union to make it the strike target."    Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GMand expects the shares to rise. But he said he did not thinkthe overall plan was "prudent."    "Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap inthe stock tomorrow," Hutton's Phillippi said.    He says GM apparently believes as a result of a costreduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels"they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within theconfines of their cash flow." Phillippi, who has been tellingclients to hold GM shares mainly for income, said on balance"we've got to feel they're doing something constructive." Reuter&#3;

Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter endedDecember 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, comparedto 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago.    Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, andanalysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell'sAllen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in theindustrial automation market.    "It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. Itis moving forward with market development and is enhancingmarket share," Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit.    Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technologymanagement conference, said first quarter sales for theAllen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. Hesaid the company does not break out operating earnings by uniton a quarterly basis.    Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in theresearch and development phase of government contracts shouldnot have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance.

In a report to Congress, he called for immediate approvalof 300 mln dlrs in new 1987 economic aid for four CentralAmerican democracies and eventual full-funding of a totaleconomic program costing 8.9 billion dlrs through 1992.    The report, mandated by Congress, explains how theadministration intends to carry out the recommendations of theReagan-appointed Kissinger Commission, which in 1984 developeda blueprint for U.S. policy in the region that was meant tooffset Reagan's military aid program for Nicaraguan rebels.    The commission, headed by former Secretary of State HenryKissinger, had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989.    "The Soviet Union and its allies have provided theSandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aidto keep Nicaragua's failed economy afloat," Reagan said.    Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who briefedreporters, said the administration will not try to linkapproval of military aid for the rebels, known as contras, withthe vastly more popular economic package for the region, assome Republican leaders in Congress have suggested.    He also expressed optimism that despite the Iran-contrascandal, Congress would approve this year's final 40 mln dlrallotment in military aid for the rebels, who are fightingManagua's leftist Sandinista government.

reut2-001.sgm, SWAP DEALERS UNVEIL STANDARD CONTRACT, The International Swap DealersAssociation has developed the first standard form contract foruse by arrangers of currency and interest rate swaptransactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association'sco-chairman.    The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expectedto make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient,he said. "The contracts wil accelerate the process and reducethe expense of swap documentation," Japsper said.    Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct ofall new issues eventually become part of either an interestrate or currency swap.    An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usuallyacting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other'sinterest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of afloating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and viceversa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remainswith the original borrower.    Bank regulators have become concerned about the use ofswaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on someportion of the risk but is not required to show it on thebalance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficientcapital to cushion it.    Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and presidentof Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank ofEngland and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected latertoday to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capitalstandards for counterparties in swaps.    The standards are part of the recently announcedconvergence agreement between the two countries in whichregulators have attempted to set similar capital requirementsfor institutions.    McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a"level playing field" be maintained in the swaps market.    He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold moreprimary capital against swap transactions than is the currentpractice, the additional costs would have to be passed on toissuers.    The issuers might then choose to do business withlower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Bankingrules.    He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct forswap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort.    That code should be completed within the next few weeks, hesaid. REUTER&#3;

Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for whathe said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals forcuts in EC farm price cuts, notably in cereals, in the comingseason.    The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecupackage of measures to help farmers in difficulty and paycompensation to those who opt for less intensive productionmethods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objectionshad forced him to withdraw sections of this package, for whichhe had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years.    He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow olderfarmers to take early retirement, either taking their land outof agricultural production or passing it to successors.    The Commission is also working on proposals to enable theEC and member states to provide direct income supports tohard-pressed small farmers. Andriessen said he could not givefull details, but member state aid would be subject to "strictcriteria to avoid distortion of competition." Reuter&#3;

He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceededimmediate needs, but Greece wanted to take advantage of lowinternational interest rates in order to make servicingpayments at a lower cost.    Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs atend-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, Halikias said.    He said the extra funds available to Greece this year willgo towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did notgive figures.    He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-yearausterity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its currentaccount deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record3.3 billion in 1985.    Halikias said he was "fairly optimistic" Greece would reach acurrent account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year.    He said domestic demand has fallen, reducing the need forimports, while Greek exports are becoming more competitive.    Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billiondlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in thesame. 1985 period, while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrsfrom 11.4 billion.

The company said the credit facility is extendable undercertain circumstances, with annual principal payments of fivemln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvalsand completion of formal documentation.

Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount ofthe March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferredshareholders, with payment expected in early April toshareholders of record March 31, the company said.    If future dividends are not declared after the Aprilexchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment willdepend on the amount of dividends received from WestcoastTransmission Co &lt;WTC>, B.C.

He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billiondlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageableamount which will assist in development plans.    The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bankadvisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year reschedulingaccord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct.    In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano saidhe thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to dowith the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decisionto suspend interest payments.    "I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of theU.S. Government, which urged several major banks to softentheir position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazilannouncement came later," he said.    Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile,objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pactwith Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day beforeVenezuela's.    Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditorsseeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans,which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. "Wecannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the newagreement and present the financing programmes we have," hesaid, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s.    Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreignborrowing, which would come from banks and multilateralagencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the nexttwo years. According to the restructured accord, this wouldwork out at around 2.5 billion dlrs. REUTER&#3;

Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand indeveloping countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.    He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went toOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)countries.    The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to theCommunity rose seven pct last year. The government plans toconcentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.    "The problem is convincing businessmen that exports arevital to survival in the context of EC competition," he said.    He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to thedomestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, whileturning their backs on foreign markets.    "They have to realise their share of the home market isgoing to shrink with growing deregulation," he said. "Foreigncompanies are taking up positions in the domestic economy andit is it vital to secure a market share abroad." REUTER&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, PS NEW MEXICO &lt;PNM> STUDIES SYSTEM PARTNERSHIP, Public Service Co of NewMexico said it is evaluating placing its electric distributionsystem in a limited partnership with assets of about 400 mlndlrs.    The utility said it advised a customer task force this isone restructuring alternative being considered for thecompany's electric business.    The structure is being evaluated as part of the company'soverall initiative in response to several goals announced byNew Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers, it explained.    Public Service New Mexico said a central feature of itsreorganization concept would be to separate the company'selectric utility operation into independent generation anddistribution entities, creating the opportunity for a targeted35 mln dlr a year rate decrease.    Noting the use of the limited partnership structure by avariety of businesses recently, the company said it believes"the concept may well have an application in the utilitybusiness and intend to investigate it fully."    The generation company would provide projected power needsof the distribution entity under a 30-year "power securityagreement" which would have a federally regulated ratestructure, the company said.    Public Service New Mexico said the restructuring couldprovide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utilitycompanies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding companyapproved by the company's shareholders in May 1986.    This holding company would be the general partner of thelimited partnership, the company said.    The company said its limited partnership concept waspresented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by Gov.Carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals.    It said the reorganization and limited partnership are analternative structure that would  help reduce rates through alower overall cost of capital.    Last month the governor said "I have outlined to PNMcritical goals which I have asked them to cooperate with mayadministration in achieving" adding the goals include immediaterate reduction, stabilization of future rates and stimulationof business expansion.    The company told the task force the new distributioncompany, under the limited partnership alternative orotherwise, would continue to be fully regulated by stateregulators.    PNM's proposed generation company would continue to beowned by common shareholders through the holding company. Itsrates would be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissionwhich regulates for wholesale electric power sales andtransmission services. The generation company would have noretail customers.

The bondsstarted trading this morning at 20 stg pct.    Dealers noted the market had seen vigorous demandthroughout the day, prompted mainly by sterling strength.    Dealers said that demand had been seen for the tap fromboth domestic and overseas sources, including from Japan andthe U.S.    Although the issue had not been designated as free of taxto residents abroad (FOTRA) widespread bullish sentiment forthe market in general had generated foreign buying.    The stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when itwas announced and dealers said that even first thing thismorning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparableexisting stocks.    However, sterling's continuing firm performance hadprompted interest in the tap right at the outset.    The issue's value had been enhanced by its partly-paidstructure, which not only enabled investors to defer payment ofthe major part of the price until April 27, but also conferreda substantial gearing element.    This meant, dealers explained, that investors who boughtthe bonds benefitted fully from price gains registered by themarket in general, although only 20 stg pct of the totalpurchase price was tied up initially.

reut2-001.sgm, LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER, A leaf disease affecting seven pct ofSri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year andraise currently depressed prices, industry officials andresearchers told Reuters.    About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the RubberResearch Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus"corenes pora" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills theleaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago.    Trade sources say prices might boom once again if thecrisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000tonnes.    Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubberclones if no immediate action is taken.    "The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the treesseriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to usechemicals to kill the disease," an Institute spokesman said.    Senior industry and research officials met yesterday atPadukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling thefungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the StatePlantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.    The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubberland with the balance belonging to small private producers witha total of 145,600 hectares.    The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the ResearchInstitute as high yielding and recommended two years ago forplanting. Only the two state groups seriously planted theseclones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but olderPBX Malaysian clones.    Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decidedto uproot only some of the affected trees while others would betreated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.    Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past weekbut prices had hit their lowest since last December. "If thereis a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise," a spokesmanfor a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.    Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by aboutfour rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepeone-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at thisweek's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the sameperiod.    Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an averageof 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes inDecember because of wintering in early February in producingareas.    Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction withthe supply position showing improvements.    Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber lastmonth did not raise prices as on previous occasions.    "Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed ofthe rubber we already had," one buyer said.    Other sources said there were few forward contracts andspeculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivalsaggravated the problem.    European buyers delayed their purchases because of winterclosures of factories and also in the hope that prices wouldease further.    They said another problem that could hit the industry isthe dry spell in producing areas. "If the inter-monsoonal rainsexpected in late March/April are delayed, we would have furthershortages," one official said.    "But this again could benefit prices," a buyer said. Reuter&#3;

Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and General Motors Corp &lt;GM> sell cars inEurope, where about 10.5 mln new cars a year are bought. GMalso makes a few thousand in North American plants for Europeanexport.     Now Chrysler Corp &lt;C> is saying it will begin exportingAmerican-made vehicles before the end of this year to Europe, amarket it left in 1978 when it was near bankruptcy.    Ford's European operations in Britain and West Germanymanufactured and sold about 1.5 million cars in Europe lastyear -- the largest U.S. Manufacturer's share of the Europeanmarket.    Opel/Vauxhall, with factories in West Germany, Spain andBritain, accounted for most of GM's sales in Europe with about1.3 million vehicles in 1986, officials said.    James Fry of GM overseas distribution system said GM hopedfor a five-fold rise this year in sales of North American-madevehicles in Europe, selling between 7,000 and 8,000 (NorthAmerican-made) units in Europe for the year to August 1987. "Alow dollar makes our prices very attractive," he told Reuters.    Using an average price of 13,000 dlrs per car, hisprojected sales figure would translate into between 91 millionand 104 mln dlrs in turnover, Fry added.    That would be a jump from 1986 when GM sold 1,500North-American made cars for revenue of 19 mln dlrs.    Ford has 41 factories in West Europe, which manufacture allof its cars sold on the continent.  But Walter Hayes, vicepresident of Ford Europe, told Reuters he did not expect alarge rise in sales this year as a result of the weak dollar. "We have concluded that despite the dollar difference.... Europeis inevitably a small volume market."    Hayes said the cost of changing American cars to conform toEuropean environmental specifications cut into profit margins.    But Robert Lutz, Chrysler executive vice-president, saidthe weak dollar would now help Chrysler compete in Europe. "After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about tore-enter the European market," he said.    "We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture herebecause it will allow us to take full competitive advantage ofthe favorable exchange rates due to the declining value of thedollar."

reut2-001.sgm, BUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM, The Bundesbank is planning changes inthe system by which banks bid for funds in securitiesrepurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key openmarket instrument, central bank officials said.    Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tenderprocess to two days from three currently, enabling theBundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if itchooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly.    The changes will probably come into force in April.    Under the current system, banks must themselves specify atthe tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbankfor subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business.    Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custodyaccounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks,which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level.    Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in suchaccounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area.    The change to come into force next month will allow theBundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself,in a process legally comparable to direct debiting.    At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender onMonday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces theresult early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday.    The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts orlonger tender periods being necessary.    For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Fridayto be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow(Thursday). The advance announcement took into account thecarnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurtyesterday (Tuesday).    Central bank officials and money market dealers said theshortening of the tender process should be seen as purelytechnical, with no direct implications for interest rates.    "It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,"said an official at the Hesse LZB.    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last Decemberthat security repurchase pacts had proved a much greatersuccess since their introduction in their present form twoyears ago, and praised their flexibility.    The tender process changes will make the repurchase pactinstrument even more flexible, banking economists said.    By speeding up the tender process, they will make itpossible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts forperiods of less than a month, something long sought by banks,to respond to changing money market conditions.    "With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will berefined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates," saidBerliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist HermannRemsperger.    The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to moneymarket developments, but by steering liquidity, not interestrates, he said. REUTER&#3;

The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from thefading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and thevalue of the dollar, the institute said in a report.    The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in thecourse of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as awhole because year on year rates will remain negative in thefirst part of 1987.    Provisional inflation figures for February released lastweek showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lowerthan in February 1986.

reut2-001.sgm, FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE, The Federal Reserve Board votedunanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk ofinterest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effortto come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks thattakes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and otherassets.    Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issuestoday by the Bank of England.    The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.    The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risksassociated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchangecontracts and similar financial instruments.    Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelinesfor calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activitiesthat banks would be required to take into account incalculating the minimum financial cushion they would need tomaintain.    Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loansand other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk thatwould establish a bank's minimum capital needs.    The additional guidelines proposed today would determinethe amount of capital support required for a bank's currentexposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.    The current exposure would be measured by themark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect thereplacement cost.    Potential future increases in the replacement cost would becalculated using credit conversion factors based on statisticalanalyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. bankingregulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of theasset.    The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balanceconflicting needs for precision and simplicity.    They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of theparticular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.    Board officials said the new gauge could increase thecapital required of the largest money center banks, which arethe principal participants in these types of activities.    They cautioned the Fed board to take account of thepotential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks tocompete in world financial markets.    However, the staff concluded, "The credit risks inherent insuch contracts now constitute a significant element of the riskprofiles of some banking organizations."    The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largestparticipants in this market, on grounds the benefits ofincluding the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.    Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchangecontracts traded on organized exchanges.    Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan wasnot involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capitalrules. Reuter&#3;

The ministers agreed that under this "extensification"scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cutoutput of specific products by at least 20 pct.    The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal andwine, they added.    Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts byreducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce theirnumber of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case,farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacityfor output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.    The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed butwill be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit onthe production they forego.    The sources said the package also contains provisions forpayments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protectingor improving the environment.    It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favouredfarming areas would be extended to crops. At present suchallowances are available only for livestock.    The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research intoalternative farming techniques, the sources added.    At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessensaid the Commission is also working on proposals to enable theEC and member states to provide direct income supports forrelatively poor farmers.    Andriessen did not give full details, but said member stateaid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion ofcompetition."    EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive adifficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplusproduction.    The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last nightproposals to pay "early retirement" pensions to farmers aged 55or over who gave up production. Those who took their landcompletely out of farm production, rather than passing it on totheir heirs, would have received more generous payments.    Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revisedproposals along these lines in an effort to get a schemeagreed. Reuter&#3;

At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of theso-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of acurrency or interest rate contract and an estimate of itspotential change in value due to currency or interest ratefluctuations until the contract matures.    In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balancesheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one offive risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on thequality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of thecontract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, theplans showed.    The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees wouldnot be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.    They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of riskweights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic nationalgovernment agencies, the proposals showed.    The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spotforeign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures andoptions exchanges.    It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of Englandwere keen to encourage banks to "net" contracts -- consolidatemultiple contracts with the same counterparty into one singleagreement to create one single payments stream.    It recognised that "such arrangements may in certaincircumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage theirfurther development and implementation," and said some of thecurrent proposals may be changed to take this into account.

reut2-001.sgm, COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S., Failure of talks on re-establishingInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last weekmay put political pressure on the United States, particularlythe State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. isunlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by"objective criteria", U.S. officials said.    Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and headof Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on hisreturn from London that the United States is willing to resumethe coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.    Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" indiscussing the method of establishing objective criteria andany transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim ofestablishing an objective method of setting quotas.    At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculatedby a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportableproduction and verified stocks, while large producers led byBrazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division ofshares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced themarket share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to supportlegislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to complywith any future coffee quotas.    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing thecoffee policy situation following the collapse of the Londontalks, but "nobody is proposing we change our position."    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffeepolicy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee marketoffensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,to soften the consumer position.    "Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil willkind of want to test the resolve of other producers andconsumers," said one U.S. official.    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, saidBrazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next fewmonths in an effort to drive down prices and pressure othercountries, particularly the splinter group of small producerswho differed with the major producers in London.    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from LatinAmerican countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to theU.S. State department, and to the National Security Council inthe White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.officials said.    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffeepolicy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly frompolitically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.officials said.    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombiaat the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based onobjective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Ricajoined the splinter group, which said it would agree toobjective criteria.    There is a strong feeling among some in the StateDepartment that the United States should continue to supportthe splinter group of producers who have taken thepolitically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objectivecriteria question, U.S. officials said.    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to besome pressure to reassess positions.    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., theNetherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand onthe issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nationsto successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.    However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was attimes qualified and there is some concern that the EuropeanCommunity could come under pressure to be more accommodative toproducers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast andother African producers during the talks.    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.    While political manuevering by small producers andconsuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said thekey to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.    U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for thefailure of the talks and said a more flexible position fromBrasilia would be the most important step toward agreement. Reuter&#3;
reut2-001.sgm, IBM &lt;IBM> DEMONSTRATES NEW CHIP, International BusinessMachines Corp said it demonstrated an experimental computerchip called an opto-electronic receiver that transforms lightinto electrical signals that translate into computer language.    IBM said the chip is two times faster than any similar chipreported and can read 40 encyclopedia volumes a second.    The chip is made of gallium arsenide which moves electricalsignals faster than the silicon used in most computer circuits.    IBM also said that since gallium arsenide is more efficientin turning light signals into electrical signals, it seems tobe an ideal material for the light-based computercommunications expected to be widely used in the future.    The chip's speed is also enhanced through the eliminationof wiring by placing the functionally dissimilar photodetectorand transistor circuitry close together.    Bringing these elements closer together also isolates thereceiver from other electronic circuits and reduces noise anddistortion, it said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST, Torrential rains throughoutArgentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarsegrain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularlyaffected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid tosoybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April orMay.    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghumcrops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yieldsand cut the total volume of this year's harvest.    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume ofthe coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central SantaFe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct oftotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest wasestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two toseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the1985/86 harvest.    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according toofficial figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and ninepct of total planted area.    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowersfor this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figureof 3.14 mln hectares.    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mlnand 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the1985/86 harvest.    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two andfour pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mlnhectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit arecord 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figuresput last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very goodcondition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest isexpected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. Reuter&#3;

Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee thatapplying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops wassupported by the Reagan administration and would saveapproximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in cornpayments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.

Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiencypayments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose notto plant under the decoupling scheme.    If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, marketprices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminisheddeficiency payments.

Samuels suggested that a working party be set up to examinethe dispute, instead of a panel empowered to rule on it.    In another development, Hong Kong, supported by a largenumber of developing countries, attacked the "textile andapparel trade act of 1987" introduced in the U.S. Congress lastFebruary 19.    Hong Kong representative Michael Cartland said the bill is"blatantly protectionist." He added there is "almost nothing aboutthe bill which could be regarded as in any way consistent witheither the GATT or the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA)."    If the bill were to be passed by Congress, Cartland said "itwould forestall any attempt to negotiate liberalisation ofworld trade in textiles."    GATT's council also decided to set up a working party tostudy China's application for full GATT membership. The groupis due to report to the next GATT council meeting on April 15. Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986, Turkey expects a 1986 balance of paymentsdeficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is takingsteps to improve its performance in this and other fields, AliTigrel, director of economic planning at the State PlanningOrganisation said.    He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence ofeconomic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.    Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after adrop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasurywholesale index last year.    This year's target of 20 pct "might be attainable but theeconomic management will have to be careful," he said.    Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programmewhich is central to the government's economic planning, saidTurkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current accountshortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.    "We must alleviate the current account substantially tosustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secureover the last five years," he added.    His comment echoed last October's Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development report on Turkey, which saidAnkara's case for more medium-term financing on better termswould look better if inflation were lower and the currentaccount deficit cut or turned into a surplus.    "In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sectorinvestments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as apercentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visibleimprovement in the current account deficit," he said.    Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year wasalso to blame for the high deficits.    Appropriations to government departments had been cut byeight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreignborrowing by municipalities had been restrained.    "We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to theinvestment programme and do not exceed their appropriations," hesaid. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowingrequirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated5.6 pct in 1986.    More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was alsotargeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourageexports, and production incentives were being considered.    "We must try to make sure that more capacity is injectedinto the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotionpolicy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment andlocal private capital come more into play as far asmanufacturing capacity is concerned," Tigrel said.    He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkisheconomy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still underway. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange ratepolicy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be donein a country where the state still dominates industry and thecurrency is only partially convertible.

reut2-001.sgm, ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION, Drilling for oil in California islikely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levelsdespite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analystssaid.    Because much of the crude oil in California fields isthick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have toincrease to near 1985's levels before any significant recoveryis seen in drilling, they said.    "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.    Few new wells now are being drilled.    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, comparedto about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger OilInformation Services, which tracks California drillingactivity.    "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state'sdrilling activity.    Current prices are not enough to justify increaseddrilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California IndependentProducers Association.    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pactto curb production boosted oil prices early this year, priceseventually fell.    Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, haveslumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a highof about 17 dlrs.    More than half of California's oil comes from stripperwells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and thatmuch of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel toextract, Malmgreen said.    "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"Malmgreen said.    Many stripper wells along the southern California coastproduce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inlandwells frequently require the use of steam injection to spurextraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.    The outlook for future production in California is cloudedby a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.    In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, whichproduces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratorydrilling has slowed to a crawl.    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell ofthe state energy commission. So far this year only fiveexploratory wells have been drilled.    "I don't think they'll even get to what they did lastyear," Mitchell said.    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest ofthe decade, Mitchell said.    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in thenumber of producing wells and overall production.    Between February and October of 1986, the number ofproducing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 frommore than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California EnergyCommission.    In line with that decrease, California's crude oil outputfell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and isexpected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.    Between February and October 1986, California's crude oilproduction slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrelsper day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department ofConservation.    "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,"Guerard said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, OUTBOARD MARINE &lt;OM> RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMOR, Wall Street traders said the stock ofOutboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cabletelevision program that Outboard is a likely takeover target ofSun Chemical Corp &lt;SNL>.    Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8to 31-1/2 Tuesday.    A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to gofor control of the whole company.    An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on therumor.    The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for upto 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.    A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.    Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights planthat will be triggered when a person or group acquiresbeneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or beginsa tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.    Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategicplanning, said management wants to stay independent. "We arenot trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with ourstrategic plans," he said.    That plan includes integrating five boat companies thatOutboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jonessaid all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.    An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a"decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs ashare is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said.    Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is inregistration for a two mln common share offering with MorganStanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemicalto strike before the offering is underway. Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES, The Canadian Wheat Board has advisedthe federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid tofarmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop yearbeginning August 1, a board spokesman said.    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommendedprice drops but said it would not be good news for westernCanadian grain growers.    "They're all lower," he said. "This is really gettingpretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survivaland whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board willrecommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain isdelivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, thefarmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. Ifprices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made inApril, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and thefederal cabinet.    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27pct but last fall the government announced a one billionCanadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.    But federal agricultural officials have already warnedfarmers not to depend on additional government aid this year. Reuter&#3;

David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main partieswould continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope ofresolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.    The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protectthe U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,officially known as semiconductors.    The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules byallowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimumprices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.    The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gaveU.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.    Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the ECcomplaint during the heated Council debate.

reut2-001.sgm, TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM>, General Motors Corp staged an explosiverally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announcedyesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded bystiff competition and erosion of market share.    GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analystsagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.    "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of KidderPeabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancingshareholder value."    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for thebuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker torecapture lost market share.    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buyback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. Theannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on thestock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and atleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on agood performance expected from new car models.    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said therepurchase program is not a positive.    "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook andputs more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM willhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stockshould settle back down to around 76, he added.    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from fourdlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domesticcar and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars arenot selling as well as their competitors," he said.    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from theyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> andChrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said Februarysales showed improvement over January, adding that it expectsimprovement in coming months.    Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fallto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,analysts said. The numbers include imports.    Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and productimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by thefourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.    "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling upits sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a majorearnings surprise in the winds," he said.    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, inpart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is moreconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuationwith respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said.    Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currentlyfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield thanits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cashdividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Incsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, ifsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of itsmarket share.    "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that willonly curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middleof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, hesaid results will not improve until 1988.    "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is atransition year for GM," he said.    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will notaffect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what theyearn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that'simportant." Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN LOW GROWTH MODEL, Healthy growth in corporate profits and inconsumer spending, the two pillars on which Japan rests itshopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at thecore, economists polled by Reuters said.    Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replaceexports as the engine of growth. But close ties betweencorporate performance and wages mean that the alternativeeconomic model promises little but slower growth, they said.    Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turnwill cut sales and further reduce profits.    The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improvedterms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domesticdemand grow steadily.    However, this would happen only if household spendingincreased in line with the value of real financial assets dueto stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered asprofits from domestic sales improved compared with those fromexports.    "No clear sign of such developments has so far beenevidenced," the central bank said.    Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growthwill be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improvedsharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillipsand Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pctwhile output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large pricemargin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companiesdid not pass that advantage on to the consumer.    Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between thefall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop inconsumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms oftrade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors.    The economists, however, believe this layer of fat willprotect companies for only a short while. As more firms seekmore profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domesticcompetition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports.Retail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer.    A December survey by top business organisation Keidanrenconfirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves.    Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in productionvolume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance,said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara.    Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cuttingunprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors(which employ significant numbers of workers), holding downwages, and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fearsunemployment could soon double from three pct now.    Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurtsales. But reduced bonuses, and worries about individualfinancial security could be even more damaging.    Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with whatamounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them tobuy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza.    To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tiedbonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods.    Economists also predict Japanese will not save less thanthe average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary, apoor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen theresolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education,and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary.    The last government survey of public opinion said over 80pct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidlyageing population and minimal social security and its workersfear poverty in their old age.    Faced with such a vicious circle, the government'sreflationary strategies are severely limited.    The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party andFinance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in smallsupplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentivewithout reducing revenue. Independent economists have been lessthan excited at the results.    Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited.    The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politicallyimpossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rateat only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said.    Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in somekind of deposit, official figures show.    Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive whilefirms are planning cuts in capital investment.    The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and landprices are the only current results of high liquidity.    Fear of inflation also limits policy options. Politicalanalysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 bigelection victory largely to a long period of almost zero priceinflation. And he found this year that attempts to impose asales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition. REUTER&#3;

Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house ofrepresentatives that the state must take the initiative inmolding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assisttroubled oil producers.    His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exemptstripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each dayfrom the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that themajority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper wellcategory and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can becrucial in determining if the well remains in production.    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt newwildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five yearsas a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods ofproduction that inject water or gas into the ground to recoveroil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugentsaid. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiarywells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a dayfor three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 abarrel.    "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federaladministrations to develop a coherent energy policy for thenation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugentsaid. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,follow, or get out of the way."

reut2-001.sgm, COLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE, Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviriablamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of lastweek's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on exportquotas.    "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexiblethan the one of Brazil, where current economic and politicalfactors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviriatold Reuters in an interview.    The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the otherfor the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce exportquotas after being extended through the weekend in London.    Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successfuloutcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigentattitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made itimpossible.    In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviriasaid the U.S. attitude would have serious economic andpolitical consequences, not necessarily for a country likeColombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and forsome African countries.    He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relativelyhigh level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.    According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, whichtraditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total exportrevenue.    That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400mln dlrs from 1986.    Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at thestart of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mlnbags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30. Reuter&#3;

Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure toremain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captialspending will be internally financed.    Guinn also told analysts that the company faced someregulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its PacificBell operating company.    In rates hearings before, the California Public UtilityCommission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlrrevenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with thecommission, he said the figure might even be greater.    The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlrrate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculationsand assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneededmodernization costs.    Guinn also said that the company is still studying whetherto join an international consortium that plans to lay atranspacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.    "We have not agreed to anything," Guinn said, but added hewould soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and thecompany would make a decision soon on participating.    Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by theU.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operatingcompanies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn saidthe company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.    "(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.It's a commodity business and becoming more so," he said. "I'mnot so sure we would be interested in getting back into thatbusiness."    However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for theBell operating companies to expand into non-regulatedbusinesses and provide more flexibility to form strategicalliances with other companies.    He added that while the company welcomes the expansion intonew areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusitiontalks. "We do not have anything actively under consideration,"he said.

reut2-001.sgm, NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY, U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are askingbanks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushionthem against the risks posed by the interest rate and currencyswap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.    After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today bythe Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers saidthat in effect, regulators are asking them to set asidereserves twice for the same risk.    Market participants will have 60 days to respond to theproposals.    Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especiallysignificant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volumeof about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiledby Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers ineurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involvedin some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates thatabout 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions areoutstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of theInternational Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President ofKleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Associationhas no comment and will study the proposals.    "What they are proposing is really double counting," Patrickde Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanleyand Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either berequired to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pctper year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost ofreplacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.    "The potential risk factors are very large relative to whatwe had expected," said a director at one U.K. merchant bank."What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you mighthave 10 years from now," he added.(Adds title first paragraph).    Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered bythe agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have acompetitive advantage because they will not have to pass thecosts on to customers.    Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about theexclusion of other countries from the new requirements. FederalReserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of theproposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned thatJapan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft newcapital rules.     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bankregulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a singlecounterparty against each other.    The paper said that regulatory authorities "recognize thatsuch arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reducecredit risk." Furthermore, the paper said, if a nettingagreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, itmight be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on anairtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.     "One problem is that there has never been a major defaultin the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swaparrangements will really stand up in court," said one bankofficial. Reuter&#3;

In a televised interview, Speakes was contrasting thedefensive, much-criticized efforts Reagan made in earlyattempts to cool the scandal with the dynamic speech heexpected when the president addressed the nation tonight.    "When we went into those press conferences and thatnationwide address in November right after the (Iran) storybroke, the president did not have the proper information,"Speakes said.    "And that's why we were misled. And consequently, thepresident and I misled the public, to a certain extent."    "We were badly served by the people that were involved inthe Iranian crisis and running the show."    Asked whom he meant, Speakes said former National SecurityAdviser Robert McFarlane; McFarlane successor John Poindexter;and then-National Security Council aide Oliver North.    Speakes said those three had prepared a false chronology ofevents "that misled us into thinking that we had all the facts..."    McFarlane has said that he, North and Poindexter haddoctored a White House chronology to obscure and minimizeReagan's role in the arms sales. He said they did that as partof an effort to prepare the president for a November 19 newsconference. Reuter&#3;
reut2-001.sgm, BANK OF CANADA MADE AGGRESSIVE USE OF T-BILLS, The Canadian government's reducedborrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make "aggressiveuse" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost offinancing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report.    The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, alsonoted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrsat the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs inJanuary, 1986, and that the country's economy performedunevenly while inflation remained a major concern.    Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of newbond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen thereliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantaillymore through short term treasury bill financings.    "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meantthat the government is now able to maintain lower cash balancesand lower financing costs," said Bouey who was replaced bydeputy governor John Crow last month.    The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over theyear and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.    The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by aneight billion dlr decline in the government's financingrequirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, andgeneration of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchangetransactions.    Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank madegreater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two tofive year maturities, Bouey said.    Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made tobanks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an averageof 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billiondlrs in March, 1986.    The advances were made largely to four banks, CanadianCommercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada andthe Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have beenliquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, andthe remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid theadvances. Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, CME POSTPONES RULING ON DUAL TRADING PETITION, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME,directors have postponed action on a membership petitioncalling for a ban on dual trading, CME Chairman Jack Sandnertold Reuters.    Consideration of the petition was scheduled for a regularboard meeting today, but directors first wanted the opinions ofa special committee that has been studying trading conditionsin the Standard and Poor's 500 futures pit for the last sixmonths.    "We didn't want to preempt the committee," Sandner said.    Instead, Sandner said the board will wait for the findingsof the special S and P committee, which is considering sometype of restriction on dual trading in S and P 500 futures.    Dual trading is the legal practice in which an exchangemember can execute customer orders as well as trade for his ownaccount. Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunityfor traders to "front-run" or trade their own accounts at morefavorable prices before customer orders are executed. Sandnersaid he expects the special committee to report its findingslate next week and the board to act when those findings arepresented.    In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to aban on dual trading, Sandner pointed out that the board alreadyunanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P500 futures at a prior meeting.    The change was withheld, however, at the request of thespecial committee after a study was released and the committeefelt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively,Sandner said.    Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban ondual trading and "the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed toa ban on dual trading."    Last week, CME special counsel Leo Melamed said the specialstudy committee is considering changes only for S and P 500futures and options on futures.    In addition to the dual trading issue, the committee isalso expected to make recommendations on the possibility forelectronic order entry and execution for S and P 500 futuresand rule changes to alleviate crowded conditions in the S and Ptrading pit, Melamed said.    Melamed said at the time that in matters where a specialcommittee is appointed, recommendations from the committee areusually approved by the exchange board of directors. Reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, REAGAN IRAN SPEECH SAID TO ADMIT NEED FOR CHANGE, President Reagan, fighting to recoverpolitically from the Iran-contra scandal, plans to acknowledgein a critical speech to the nation tonight he needs to changehis ways, administration officials said.    "It will be a forward-looking speech in which he will say heaccepts the need for change," said an official who asked not tobe identified. "I think the president wants to give his side ofthe story."    The official said Reagan would tell the public what he isdoing to set things right in the wake of last week's scorchingTower commission report on the origins of the scandal.    It is not clear whether Reagan will heed the advice of manyof his political allies and acknowledge that his Iran policywas wrong and he personally made some mistakes.    Asked at his daily news briefing if the president would sayhe erred, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater toldreporters, "His views are intensely personal and I won't giveyou any advance on what he intends to say in that area."    He said the speech would be 12 or 13 minutes in length andthat Reagan would "look beyond the horizon to a revitalizedWhite House that will pursue an active foreign policy."    "The president will discuss the Tower board report and itsrecommendations. He'll focus on changes he's making in thestructure of the NSC (National Security Council) and his goalsfor the next two years," the spokesman said.    To date, Reagan has defended his decision to sell arms toIran and conceded only there were errors in implementation.    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said tonight's speechmight be Reagan's last chance to repair his presidency.    "It's about the ninth inning ... he has to try and set us onanother course. It's hard to do that, he probably won't be ableto do it," Dole told reporters. Reuter&#3;

"How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreementif the United States does not want to offer us grain atcompetitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy traderepresentative of the Soviet Union to the United States.    "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to theUnited States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitiveprices," he said in an interview.    Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up theagreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain atprevailing market prices.    "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said.    Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales ofcommodities under this Agreement will be made at the marketprice prevailing for these products at the time ofpurchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms."    "The United States should supply to the Soviet Uniondefinite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is theUnited States ready to supply this?" he said.    The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand hasbeen met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which heconfirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn pricesremain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.    Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.    "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to theUnited States to decide how these competitive prices will beoffered," he said.    Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Sovietswas rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.

reut2-001.sgm, LEGISLATORS COOL TO NEW STOCK TAX IDEA, Key tax and budget lawmakersWednesday expressed reservations about the suggested newsecurities tax, which has has aroused concern on Wall Streetand put pressure on brokerage stocks.    Grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cutfederal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit targetof 108 billion dlrs, House Speaker Jim Wright suggested the taxbe studied as one way to raise more federal revenues.    The Texas Democrat's idea as first presented to House Waysand Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski this week wouldtax sales and purchases of securities. A tax of 0.25 to 0.5percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year.    Rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too earlyto back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securitiestransfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review bycongressional tax analysts, a spokesman said.    The Illinois Democrat has repeatedly stressed this year heis reluctant to back a tax increase so long as President Reaganmaintains his staunch opposition.    "First we've got to decide whether to raise additionalrevenues. Only then can we consider the specific options. Atthis point nothing is on or off the table. It's just too early,"Rostenkowski said in a statement.    He made no commitment to Wright in a private meetingTuesday, and in fact was not asked for one, a House sourcesaid. The idea was presented only as something that might ormight not be valuable, he said.    House Budget Committee chairman William Gray agreed it wasanother option to be looked at, if Congress decided it neededto raise revenues to reduce the deficit, an aide said.   The Pennsylvania Democrat does not intend to recommendspecific tax proposals, the aide said. The Budget Committeewill recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decisionon how the taxes will be raised.    The securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount ofrevenue to ease Congress's difficult task of trimming thedeficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target.    But some in Congress feared that such a tax could drivesecurities business offshore and hurt U.S. investment, andthere were uncertainties about the details of the tax.    Democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives sofar this year. This week they are scheduled to discuss thebudget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but nodecisions are anticipated, congressional sources said.    At the same time, without President Reagan's assent to ageneral tax increase, they are left with piecemeal taxes thatare guaranteed to anger those who must pay.    "We could just do all of them," one congressional source saidof the various tax ideas -- excise taxes, securities taxes, oilimport fee and others. Reuter&#3;

"We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has beenin place for just a little over a year and in our judgmentthere is more to be gained at the present time from maintainingthe legislation.    "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farmbill is better on balance than any of the alternatives beingadvanced," Kleckner said.    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much ashe deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeanscompetitive in the world market.    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should beeligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIKcertificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel andthe new loan rate.

Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues ofentertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers andtheir financial backers decided not to top National's bid.    "We've had counsel working for some time in every regionwhere Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reutersin a telephone interview.    Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working veryclosely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seekingapprovals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cablesystems since September when its management group firstadvanced a buyout plan.    But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited biddingcontest which was capped by the announcement this morning thatViacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered intoa defintive merger agreement with National.    National is a family business which operates a chain ofmovie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.    Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on throughthe night but also excited at the prospect of running a leadingelectronic media company. He noted that the number of motionpicture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.    Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone saidexclusive contracts with pay television networks are theemerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motionpicture on any pay channel," Redstone said.    He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studiosand plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.    Redstone said the management group's investment bankerswill be paid what is due for termination of its mergeragreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That willbe a company expense," Redstone said.    He said BankAmerica &lt;BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiriesfrom lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlrfinancing for the deal.

reut2-001.sgm, BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM, A senior British official said thatprotectionist bills being considered by Congress could triggerretaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten theglobal trading system.    Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said ifCongress passed legislation to curb textile imports, whichwould hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asiantextile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."    His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian TradeMinister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, thecommunity would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.    Channon made his remarks at a news conference after twodays of talks with Reagan Administration officials and membersof Congress.    De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.    Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment inCongress since his visit here last year as Congress and theAdministration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. tradedeficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.    Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation toforce Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.    Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyoneproblems - its surplus with the United States last year was51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.    "The more united pressure there could be, the better," hesaid.    Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation toavoid trade disputes.    He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontationearlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain andPortugal joined the community and its liberal importsregulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.    "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," hesaid, ""it does not mean that they would do so on anotheroccasion."    Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment inEurope over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressureof unilaterally imposed deadlines."    He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft andtaxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United Statesmust therefore learn to manage their relations better."    He said another bill to let the United States retaliateagainst a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement onTariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.    He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and notby the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to beinterpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what isto happen to the rest of us?"    reuter&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, TWA &lt;TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> SITUATION, Trans World Airlines Inc complicatedthe bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buyPiedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge withPiedmont and USAir.    Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Streetspeculated the board was discussing opposing bids from NorfolkSouthern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortlyafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. Italso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir andthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offerfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal forUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it saidit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of theairlines.    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairmanCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline intothe takeover arena.    "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWAinto play. There's speculation on the street he just wants tomove onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWAmight just be putting up a trial balloon."    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,but that the airline will probably reject it because the priceis relatively low compared to other airline deals.    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible byrevealing financing arrangements. "They need to show theircommitment and their ability to finance. I think it's acredible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.    "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative valuesof airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs wouldbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. Aspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had notchanged its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct ofthat airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balancefor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mlnshares.    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, alsoremained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck withits offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmontand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeoverof Piedmont.    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir tomake his own airline a more attractive takeover target.    "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and therewere no takers. I think the strategy might have called formaking his investment more attractive. One way to accomplishthat specific objective is to go out and acquire otherairlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.    "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least thisway it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim.    But Icahn's financing ability for such a transactionremains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to dothe offer.    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financialadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements.   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X>and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.    Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan wasimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWAoffer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered withcontingencies and it doesn't even have a financingarrangement," said one executive at another major airline.    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be astrong contender with USAir's east coast route system andplanned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed theintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence inits St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,to the mix would develop an even stronger force.    The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservationsystem.    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it wouldresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.    Reuter&#3;

He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptableas the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.    "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,"Calmon added.    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mlnbags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.    "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this wasbetter than such a quota reduction," he added.    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and greencoffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severedrought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under10 mln bags.    Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, ofwhich 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvestthis year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.    The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for lastyear's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believeit was higher than this. Reuter&#3;

The figures represented a slight recovery for the industryfrom weak mid-February sales, but the eight domestic-based carmanufacturers still saw sales fall 9.1 pct for the full monthfrom last year.    GM, whose sales have been weakening for several months,took only 48.1 pct of domestic car sales in the February 21-28period compared with 55.7 pct a year ago, when sales for theentire industry were depressed from the ending of majormarketing incentive campaigns.    At the same time, rival Ford Motor Co &lt;F> said its carsales in the period rose 29.3 pct and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> was up11.3 pct.    The industry leader's slide was even more marked for thefull month as GM took only 37 pct of all car sales in February,including imports, compared with 43.5 pct a year ago.    Industry analysts said the 198,818 domestic-make cars soldin the seven selling days of late February represented aseasonally adjusted annualized rate of 7.0 mln units while the556,953 sold in the month were at a 7.4 mln annual rate.    Last year, the industry sold a record 11.44 mln new cars,including 8.2 mln domestic makes. But consumers have taken abreather since then and car sales sales have been weaker in1987 due to tax-induced heavy buying in December, a lack ofwidespread sales incentives and intermitent bad weather,analysts said.    GM sales vice-president C.N.

The company said it would sell all of its businesses otherthan the American Air Filter business, make a public financingof more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currentlyoutstanding debt with the proceeds.    Under the plan, which was presented to institutionallenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit GuarantyCorp, "substantial amounts" of institutional debt would beconverted to common stock of the restructured company.    Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferredstock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt andpreferred stock for common equity will cause a "resultingdilution of the existing common stock," Allis-Chalmers said ina statement.    Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existingpreferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.    Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan isbankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors,common and preferred holders,and present and former employees.    Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing "appears torepresent the company's only alternative if agreement upon theterms of the plan cannot be reached."    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he wasnot aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings thatwould result from the restructuring.    "It is too early to talk about a charge" because the planmust still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.    Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' privatelenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligationsincurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.    Payment of health benefits for active and retired employeeswould be made "at substantially reduced levels."    Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipmentcompanies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutzof West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company withbusinesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handlingand solid materials processing.    Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business toAC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.

"For example, by falsifying its books and records, TRWinflated the price of a military engine blade by two to threetimes higher than the price of a virtually identical commercialengine blade," Dingell said in a statement.    Eagleye and two other former employees filed a suit againstTRW last year charging the company with overcharging thegovernment. The Justice Department later joined the suit.    "While employed by TRW and while under investigation by TRW,I disclosed to TRW's legal department and higher management,many flagrant and obvious violations of law, company policy andethical conduct. None of this evidence was included in TRW's(1984) report to the government," he said.    Reuter&#3;
reut2-001.sgm, PENTAGON DELAYS PLAN TO BUY EUROPEAN MISSILE, The U.S. Army has delayed plans tobuy a European anti-aircraft missile to help protect U.S.ground forces from Soviet attack helicopters, DefenseDepartment officials said.    The Army has been considering buying some British Rapiermissiles or French and German Roland missiles as a stop-gappartial replacement this year for the flawed U.S. Sgt. YorkDivision Air Defense (DIVAD) gun which was canceled in 1985.    Despite recent indications by the service that it intendedto buy the missiles soon, defense officials told Reuters afinal decision had been suspended because some Army officialsfavored a more versatile gun-missile combination.    The gun-missile combination would open the competition wideto U.S. firms.    "The missile option is on hold now and no decision has beenmade," said one of the Pentagon official, who asked not to beidentified.    "There is some sentiment to take things more slowly and seeif we can avoid a stop-gap system until we can come up with anintegrated system of our own," said another official.    Army Lt. Col. Craig McNab said, however, that Ronald andRapier "are not out of the picture by a long shot."    There has been strong sentiment in the Army to reject amissile only and to opt for a more versatile combination gunand missile system mounted on a tracked vehicle.    Such a move would throw the competition wide open to U.S.firms, including General Electric Co &lt;GE>, Boeing Co &lt;BA>, FMCCorp &lt;FMC> and Martin Marietta Corp &lt;ML>.    But some Pentagon officials have expressed fears that an"off-the-shelf" gun-missile combination could not be fieldedquickly enough.     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger canceled the Sgt. Yorkgun, made by Ford Motor Co &lt;F> Aerospace and CommunicationsCorp, after the Pentagon had already spent 1.8 billion dlrs onthe system and then decided it could not shoot down attackhelicopters at the proper range.    The Army later expanded the division air defense concept,announcing it would divide the system into five differentcomponents for the 1990s at a cost of more than 10 billiondlrs, including a missile and gun-system combination on atracked vehicle.

reut2-001.sgm, INTERNATIONAL BORROWING REACHES RECORD IN 1986, Record high borrowing of 376 billion dlrsin 1986 on international capital markets was supported by alarge volume of debt refinancing and growing integrationbetween national and international markets, the OECD said.    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes inthe relative importance of the instruments used ininternational financing.    Straight bond offerings, equity related securities andeuro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financingrose to their highest level this decade. The markets forfloating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined.    The OECD said another striking feature of internationalcapital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration oflending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries,which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing.    Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included anotable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowingthrough the flotation of fixed-interest securities.    This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with newtechniques such as interest rate and currency swaps.    Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion ofequity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of arapidly expanding market for euro-equities.    A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowerswas more than offset by a large volume of refinancingoperations induced by improved market conditions and strongerdebt management policies. Growing integration with nationalmarkets meant the arrival of a large number of new players oninternational markets.    It added the development of a smoothly-functioning marketfor short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwrittenissuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative totraditional forms of bank lending.    Turning to 1987, the OECD pointed to indications of apossible slowdown of international markets' expansion andpossibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas.    It said many market participants saw little scope for afurther decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown inthe pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead.    It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline indemand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowerswould try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities providedby the market for euro-commercial paper.    "It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP marketwill be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper fromlower-rated borrowers," the report said, adding that any majoradvance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity wouldrequire a significantly broader investor base.

reut2-001.sgm, NYMEX OUTGOING CHAIRMAN SEES MAJOR CHANGES, Trading in energy futures on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange will change dramatically over the nextfive to 10 years as the market matures, according to outgoingchairman Michel Marks.    "Energy futures trading is going through a tremendousperiod of transition that will last five to 10 years," Markssaid, adding that volume will soar, international participationwill increase, and activity of producing countries, major oilcompanies, and speculators will grow.    Marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure whenboard elections are held March 17. He will continue as chairmanof a long-range planning committee at NYMEX.    "The priority of the next 10 years is operationalefficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new productdevelopment," said Marks.    Marks said it is imperative for NYMEX, which is running outof trading space, to process greater volumes expeditiously inorder to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts thatare already planned.    Marks said crude futures volume could more than double bythe end of the decade to 250,000 contracts daily and combinedproducts volume could soar to  100,000 contracts a day.    Much of the increased activity will come from theinternational sector, according to Marks. "That's a huge growtharea," he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreignproducer countries to foreign independent operators.     He said it would be difficult to develop a futurescontract based on an internationally traded crude although hepreviously said the exchange is exploring that possibility.    "Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crudebesides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task" he said.     Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based onan international product rather than an international crudewill be developed since the products market is more diverse. Hesaid previously the exchange is studying the possibility ofdeveloping a non-U.S. deliverable products contract.    Other sources of growth for U.S. energy futures are themajor oil companies, which already trade on the NYMEX, andinstitutional funds such as investment houses, pension funds,and insurance companies, Marks said.    "The commodities markets have become financial markets andshould pursue a partnership with financial intermediaries,"Marks said.    He said speculators will increase their share of the energyfutures markets in the coming years from the current  share ofabout 30 pct. Hedgers, as a result, will lose some of their 70pct share.

Robert Gerard, managing director of Morgan Stanley and Co,told reporters his group, which mainly represents investmentbanking firms, supported committee members who want the FederalReserve Board to postpone action on applications by three bankholding companies seeking new powers.    "The Fed ought to hold those applications in abeyancepending congressional review," Gerard said.         The legislation before the committee would recapitalize afederal desposit insurance fund for savings and loanassociations and prohibit new nonbank banks.

Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumernations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten anoversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister DenisBra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually beobliged to restore their positions.    "I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April," hetold a news conference here at his return from the failedLondon talks.    Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day inLondon down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, thelowest since 1982.    Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs(1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned byIvory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if theslide on the world markets continues.    He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoaproducer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead anAfrican initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end ofnext month.    Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-basedInter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf ofthe continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks.    "An initiative from IACO is likely very soon," he saidwithout elaborating.    "Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarkedon a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragilemarket," he said.    Questioned by journalists, the minister said PresidentFelix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that hisgovernment would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteedby the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.    Last year, the West African nation announced that thecoffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents)per kilo.    Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversifyits agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent fromworld market fluctuation.    A communique read over the state-run television tonightsaid that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteranIvorian leader reaffirmed "his faith in Ivory Coast's bright(economic) future" despite the commodities price slide.    The Agriculture Minister also announced the governmentdecided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mlndlrs) to support the country's small farmers.

reut2-001.sgm, CHARTS SIGNAL BULLISH BREAKOUT IN DEBT FUTURES, The rally Wednesday in U.S. interestrate futures left the Treasury bond contract above the top of athree month trading range which signals a bullish chartbreakout, financial analysts said.    In addition, sluggish U.S. economic data and little signthat the economy will pick up its pace in the near future maybe enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analystssaid.    "The market is paying more attention to the weakened stateof the economy right now," said Refco analyst Mike Connery.    Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factoryorders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growthwill be slow.    Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in theLombard rate after sluggish West German industrial productionfigures also provided some support.    "The domestic economies of the major trading partners ofthe U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will beforced to ease," thus paving the way for a more accomodativeU.S. credit policy, added John Michael, analyst at FirstOptions of Chicago.    Michael pointed out, however, that trimming the U.S. tradedeficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of majorindustrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices.    "The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish forbonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. Ratherthan translate those into their own currencies and sufferexchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments,"Michael said.    Indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections saidsome of the late strength in the bond market resulted frombuying by Japanese interests.    But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurredafter the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32.    "The breakout is pretty important," said chartist LeslieKeefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston. "Not only did bondsclose above recent highs but they were also above the sidewayspattern we've been in for the last three months."    Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that theJune bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, andthat the rally occurred on heavy volume, Keefe said.    Keefe said the next level of significant chart resistancewill be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. Furthermore, "we still havethe April (1986) highs to contend with," which in the nearbycontract is 105-15/32.    Michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in JuneT-bonds and "there is an outside chance to reach 106."    Keefe warned, however, that confirmation also is neededfrom other technical indicators such as relative strengthindexes and short-term momentum indicators.

reut2-001.sgm, PRESIDENT REAGAN SAYS ARMS FOR HOSTAGES WAS MISTAKE, ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY, 
reut2-001.sgm, REAGAN ADMITS IRAN ARMS OPERATION A MISTAKE, President Reagan, fighting to regainpublic confidence in the wake of the Iran arms scandal,admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as anarms-for-hostages deal and, "It was a mistake."    "When it came to managing the NSC (National SecurityCouncil) staff, let's face it, my style didn't match itsprevious track record," Reagan said in a television address tothe American people.    "I have already begun correcting this," he added in hisprepared remarks.    Reagan's speech, widely regarded as critical to his hopesof repairing his presidency, was his first detailed response tolast week's scorching Tower commission report on the secretsale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to U.S.-backedcontra rebels in Nicaragua.    Reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while hewaited for the truth to come out and admitted, "I've paid aprice for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence."    He said that a few months ago, he told the American peoplehe did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covertoperation.    "My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true,but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not," Reagan said.    "There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses. It was amistake," he said.    Reagan again said that the original Iran initiative was todevelop relations with those who might assume leadership in apost-Khomeini government.    "It's clear from the Board's report however that I let mypersonal concern for the hostages spill over into thegeo-political strategy of reaching out to Iran.    "I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare thatI didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan,"he said.    The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. JohnTower, said Reagan's "intense compassion" for Americans beingheld by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had resulted in anunprofessional and unsatisfactory policy.    It portrayed 76-year old Reagan as a man who did not knowor care much about the wide-ranging, probably illegalactivities of his National Security Council (NSC) staff, whichhatched the operation.    Reagan said he endorsed all of the Tower commission'srecommendations about the running of the NSC, adding, "In fact,I'm going beyond its recommendations, so as to put the house ineven better order."    He noted that he had appointed former Senate Republicanleader Howard Baker as his new chief of staff and said he hopedBaker would help him forge a new partnership with Congress,"especially on foreign and national security policies."    He said his new national security adviser, Frank Carlucci,was rebuilding the national security staff "with propermanagement discipline."    Reagan said that almost half the NSC professional staff nowconsisted of new people.    He said that FBI Director William Webster, his new nomineeto head the CIA, "understands the meaning of 'rule of law'".    Reagan also announced that Tower had agreed to serve as amember of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which actsas a watchdog on the nation's covert activities.    But he said that he had issued a directive barring the NSCstaff itself from undertaking covert operations -- "No ifs,ands, or buts."    Tonight's speech was a far cry from Reagan's initial strongdefense of his Iran policy.    In a televised speech last November 13, Reagan calledcharges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the U.S. war onterrorism "utterly false."    As recently as two months ago in his State of the Unionspeech, Reagan said that "serious mistakes were made" butdefended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals.    By contrast, tonight's speech had an apologetic tone thatwas a marked departure from Reagan's usual upbeat, confidentdemeanor.    He said he took full responsibility for his own actions "andfor those of my administration."    "As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without myknowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. Asdisappointed as I may be in some who served me, I am still theone who must answer to the American people for this behavior,"Reagan said.    Reagan said the message that the nation should move on hadcome from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, from alliesaround the world -- "and if we're reading the signals right,even from the Soviets."    His remark seemed to be a reference to a new Sovietwillingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-rangenuclear missiles in Europe. Reuter&#3;

In a televised address to the American people Reagan saidhe is still upset that no-one kept proper records -- acomplaint made by the Tower commission.    The arms shipment was made in August of 1985 by Israel.    "I did approve it; I just can't specifically say when,"Reagan said.    Reagan added: "Rest assured, there's plenty ofrecord-keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (theWhite House)."

He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first jointproduction venture, to build two hulls for &lt;Onomichi DockyardCo Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have beenheld with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi HeavyIndustries Co Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima HeavyIndustries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T>, he said.    Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twentyfoot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi,which would complete production.    "We expect the successful cooperation between us andOnomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with otherJapanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said.    He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost ofshipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanesetechnology and marketing. This would pose a challenge tocompetitors in Europe and South Korea.    Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrssince beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now standsat about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearlythree mln dlrs.

reut2-001.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - INDONESIA'S ECONOMY, Indonesia heads for general elections insix weeks' time with its economy in the worst shape in 20years, economists and officials said.    The government expects no spillover of "people power" fromthe neighbouring Philippines to unsettle the 20-year rule ofPresident Suharto, victory for whose ruling Golkar party in thecoming parliamentary elections is assured.    However, Western diplomats said it is the country'sdeteriorating economic position that is the main threat to itsstability.    Last year's collapse in oil prices dealt a heavy blow toIndonesia, halving its revenue from oil and gas exports to 6.5billion dlrs last year from 12.4 billion in 1985. Oil and gasaccount for 70 pct of export income.    The result is that in the run-up to April 23 elections,Suharto, far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with payincreases or tax cuts, is busy slashing budget spending.    The government has also recently increased transport faresand frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for thesecond year running, despite inflation now estimated at 8.8pct.    The current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985, while the debt service ratiowidened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986.    Foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account foralmost a third of the 1987/88 budget.    A recent U.S. Embassy report on the economy said 1986 grossdomestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s whenSuharto came to power. Western economists said GDP registerednil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in1985, and predicted only a one pct rise this year.    In its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boomyears of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct,the government is now relying more on foreign borrowings.    Indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance itsshare of new projects being built with overseas money, becauseit cannot afford even to meet local costs.    In the last three months Indonesia has taken out new loanstotalling 1.55 billion dlrs, on top of its external debt of 37billion dlrs. Western bankers said more will be needed, and thecountry now ranks sixth among Third World debtors.    A 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in Tokyo in Decemberwas followed in the first week of February with a 300 mln dlrloan from the World Bank to support the balance of payments.    Last month, Japan's Export-Import Bank agreed a 900 mln dlrloan to meet Indonesia's share of 21 World Bank projects whichwould otherwise have been scrapped or postponed. More loans areon the way, including two more from the World Bank worth atotal 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation.    U.S. Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz said in a recent speech thateconomic growth remains the key to preserving Indonesia'sfundamental stability.    The largest Moslem nation in the world, Indonesia has sofar avoided some of the more extreme paths of other Moslemcountries. But the World Bank has warned that mountingunemployment could start causing severe social strains unlessit is tackled.    It said in its annual report on Indonesia last June thatunless economic growth is revived, unemployment could reachwhat it termed "unacceptable levels."    Unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end oflast year, but those considered underemployed number around 35pct.    What path to take appears to be a matter of some disputewithin Suharto's government, with his Western-trainedtechnocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supportedby the international financial community.    But another group supports a protected economy, with moreimport substitution, the U.S. Embassy report said.    The government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against thedollar last September to help exports and curb imports, and iscurrently working on a series of measures to further encourageforeign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector.    The direction Suharto takes could affect Indonesia'sability to raise new loans in the future, Western bankers say.    So far, despite three packages of economic measures overthe past nine months, he has not touched key monopolies thatare linked to businesses controlled either by his family or bybusiness associates, diplomats and bankers say.    Diplomats and investors are now looking for action onmonopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs thatSuharto is serious about tackling the country's problems. REUTER&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EUROYEN BOND ISSUES INCREASE, The easing of rules governing overseas useof the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity buthas failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency,bond managers and traders said.    Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues inthe Eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keepingthe yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but theJapanese, they said. This lack of real yen demand through thefreer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japaneseaccord to internationalise the yen, they said.    The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japaneseinterest rates but have no need for yen. They arrange primarilywith Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into othercurrencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. More than 85pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added.    "The borrowers don't care which currency they use. They areonly after attractive money," one bond trader said.    Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previousyear, boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of thetotal Eurobond market, Koichi Kimura, managing director ofDaiwa Securities Co Ltd, said recently.    Traders said some of the activity stems from battles amongJapanese and foreign securities companies and banks for theprestige of placing a larger share of issues. Many even resortto "harakiri" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing.    But the fever continues and the number of offerings coulddouble again in 1987, said Naoki Yokoyama, manager of NikkoSecurities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation.    The Euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up byJapanese trust banks, one trader said. After a 90 day waitingperiod the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite isstrong, he added.    Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when moreattractive yields are offered on dollar and other currencyinvestments, traders said.    "Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing(in yen)," said Masaki Shimazu, manager of Daiwa's bonddepartment.    While few foreigners are interested in the secondarymarket, Japanese commercial banks, regional banks, lifeinsurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy thebonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offerlittle currency risk, traders said.    The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waitingperiod before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from180. A ministry official said it verified through sampling thatreflow was fairly small.    "We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in theEuroyen market," he said.    One trader said that although demand from Japaneseinvestors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. He saidmany investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S.Interest rates decline further.    To encourage further international use of the yen, theministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyencommercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studyingdemand from potential borrowers.    Securities company sources believe the ministry will permitnon-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the nextfew months. But they expect it to continue to ban domesticparticipation in the market for some time to come. Japanesebanks object to the short-term paper market which they seeencroaching on their business territory.    Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur moredemand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shiftinto shorter-term securities if need be.    "Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps," one bondmanager said. If more financial instruments were available,there might be more trades in yen, he added.    Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, thoughsome recent issues which are callable in three years work as ifthey had shorter maturities, traders said.    The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bondmaturities within a few months.    One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authoritiesare giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rulesgoverning international transactions of the yen. But freer useof the yen could encourage more trade settlements in theJapanese currency, he said. "If exporters or importers can raisefunds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using theJapanese yen as a settlement currency," he added.    The Finance Ministry official said the government mustconstantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit ofborrowers and investors. "No major market can keep its statuswithout change," he said. REUTER&#3;

Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last yearranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will beannounced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for aone-for-five bonus issue.    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonusissue this year, probably one for three or one for five.    The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK>is to report its 1986 results on Friday.    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of morethan one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to12 pct.    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrsfor a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed innerreserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of theHong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew bynearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.    "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at MansionHouse Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.    Government figures show that total loans and advances roseby 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.    Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay ofthe local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of fivepct in 1985.    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest receivedon loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank andHang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the bankingsystem, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.    The strength of the real-estate market was another majorincome source for the bank group. Loans to finance propertydevelopment and instalment mortgages rose sharply.    "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgagebusiness despite tough competition from the Bank of China groupand other foreign banks," one analyst said.    The high level of activity on the capital and equitiesmarkets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in HongkongBank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel andCo>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting asfinancial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said.    Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlrflotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which HongkongBank owned 30 pct at the time.    The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in returnfor 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stakein &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of twoEnglish-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and willnot show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reducedneed to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was muchlower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong LeongSecurities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions."    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said thebank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against itsshipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County SecuritiesAsia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. Sheforecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.    The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to haveimproved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrsfrom 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985. REUTER&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN, The highly visible drama involving theyen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the factthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against majorEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange ratedistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statementsby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters thecurrency movements of the past two years are also creating afundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up newtrade tensions and imbalances.    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments arealready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.    In many ways, not least in terms of rare internationalcooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact betweenthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut downthe value of the dollar was a historic one.    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the majorcurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in whichthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but notnecessarily central significance, the officials said.    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement tookplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreementsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert inTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.    "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,and that was well before Plaza," he said.    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention andperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, thedollar trend has been down, down, down.    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical crossrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. TheEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.    The close relationship between exchange rates and tradeflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, butundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three ischanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the ECboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half ofof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exportsand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.    "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have atremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unitsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is importantto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that islaying the golden egg," said de Hora.    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable yearin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to itsstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive thanU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rateimbalance, and which will cause problems.    "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC isreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. Buttherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitiveedge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First InternationalEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you wantmy objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in ourtrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

reut2-001.sgm, JAPANESE BANKS SEEN AGREEING DEBT RISK SCHEME, Japanese creditor banks are close to adecision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which theywill transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverabledebts owed by developing nations, international financialsources told Reuters.    Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and thefirm set up before the end of the month, they said.    The scheme is intended to improve financial management atthe banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debtsturning bad, the sources said.    Last week's announcement by Brazil that it wouldindefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanesecreditors to finalise the project, the sources said.    Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoida debt crisis since the start of the year, they said.    There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, andperhaps as many as 28, they said.    About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loanstotalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil, accounting for about15 pct of all commercial loans to that country.    The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is theCaribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, the sources said.    The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm withparticipating creditor banks holding the firm's stock.    The firm will then use the funds to buy from itsstock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreignloans which are potentially bad, the sources said.    The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans.    Subject to the scheme would be loans extended todebt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina, they said.    The financial sources said interest payments to the firmwould not be taxed because of its location. Japanese banks haveasked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan lossreserves, but the ministry has not yet complied.    A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said itmay encourage new lending to developing countries.    The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for upto five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubledcountries, but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accountingfor one pct of the loans.

In the absence of the opposition, LDP members of parliamentdecided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee tohold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14,parliamentary officials said.    The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations lastTuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over acontroversial government-proposed sales tax plan.    Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have beendelaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales taxon which the budget plan is based.    A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would againboycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind.    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who has vowed to pushthrough the tax reforms, told reporters: "Watching closelynegotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, I wouldlike to avoid ... Passing (the budget) singlehandedly."    The five pct tax, part of Nakasone's tax reform plan, isplanned to start next January to help offset cuts in individualincome and corporate tax.    The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearingbecause the LDP could technically stop deliberations on thebudget and ram it through the budget committee and then a LowerHouse plenary session, political analysts said.    The four opposition parties called the LDP move "anunforgivable, rash act" and said they would fight to scrap thesales tax. REUTER&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT, The outlook for the WestGerman economy is relatively bright, with gross nationalproduct expected to expand by three pct this year, KielUniversity's Institute for World Economy said.    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leadingeconomic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimisticthan that of the other institutes, some of which have recentlyreduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's exportoutlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark'sstrength against the dollar and other major currencies.    "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all inall, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight risein exports can be expected."    The institute said past experience has shown West Germanexporters will move to counterbalance currency factors bycutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjustingtheir product ranges.    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise ineconomic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, thedecline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slowthis year.    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewedadvances in domestic consumption and investment spending, bothof which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetarypolicy, the institute said.    However, it said the labour market would see only a slightimprovement because companies will be reluctant to hireadditional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly byagreed reductions in working hours.    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance ofmonetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a markedacceleration of inflation.    It also warned that what it called the worldwidesynchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a newglobal recession. It said central banks in industrializedcountries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the FederalReserve Board's expansionary course.    The institute said this in turn was bound to leadeventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central bankswere likely to follow suit, causing a recession that couldaggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well asincrease protectionism around the world.    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from thenegative effects of the global synchronization of monetarypolicy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces ofgrowth at home.    The institute said this could be done by ensuring thatfiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxesshould be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, andwage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower thanin 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationarypressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supplyto about four pct. REUTER&#3;

reut2-001.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS, Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost itseconomy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washingtonto take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remainingrestrictions two weeks ago.    Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdownof the figure, saying it takes into account a number ofhypothetical losses. Some of them are "too sophisticated toconvert into financial terms," one banking source said.    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions isimpossible to calculate.    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland'seconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.    "Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they onlycontributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said.    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most FavouredNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliationfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union undermartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy wasoriginally devised several years ago by the Institute ofNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planningcommission.    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polisheconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growthtrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases incredits from Western commercial and government lenders.    But the calculations were based on a time when trade wasbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissingthe estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point,which has no real scientific evaluation."    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports tothe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrsannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions wereimposed.    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling tradesurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrsagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland importantU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say creditsdried up for economic not political reasons.  "Poland isaccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate forpolitical reasons," said one expert. "It's an illusion based on amisunderstanding of Western economy."    "There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someonewho has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding thatPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy creditsin the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," onediplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical ordersand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing ofscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say thelifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impacton Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrsand lacks the means to modernise its industry.    "MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will notbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult toregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces arein play now," said one Western envoy.    He said Polish products were not competitive, and theirquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionistmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamperPoland's efforts to regain entry.    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognisedthis fact recently.    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Makingup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonlydifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period oftwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level ofexports by only about 100 mln dlrs."    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says ithas a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S. Which it saysimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoingof the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans willjust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushingSolidarity."    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, intalks in Washington last week with the International MonetaryFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland waslooking for a lead from the United States.    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet itsfinancial obligations to the United States, "but not in a shorttime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of itsforeign economic partners."    He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity toplay a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partnersinterested in the settlement of Polish debt."    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamedWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF andParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years andsaid it should now play a more positive role.    "As a major superpower the United States can influenceinternational organisations," he said, citing recent meetingsaimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent towhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.    The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarterwas due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg anda reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSOsaid.    However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stglower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil tradeincreased by 2.1 billion.

This follows a steady decline in the callmoney rate over the past 10 days and signals from the FinanceMinistry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.    The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead ofthe meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Fiveindustrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restoredconsiderable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeksof turbulence.    The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadilydown to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,where it has now stabilised.    Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorbliquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.    While call money has dropped by well over a percentagepoint, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate hasremained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eightpct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.    The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.    The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchaserate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, whileusing the intervention rate to set the floor.    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur saidthat he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealerssaid any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to comewhen the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,although an earlier cut could not be excluded.   A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as earlyas tomorrow morning, banking sources said.

Dlrcertificate of deposit issue for the Chinese state-owned Bankof Communications Ltd Hong Kong branch suddenly surfaced,bankers said.    Disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the roadto recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in earlyFebruary but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue.    Brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and allmajor players stopped making markets in existing issues.    The fixed rate market, which consists mainly of CDs tied toswaps or asset repackaging, began to fall about a month ago dueto indigestion after 18 CD issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrsflooded the market in January.    Bankers said the shake-up was a result of participantspushing the market up too fast in January amid intensespeculation that the Hong Kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate againstthe U.S. Dollar would soon be changed.    The speculation depressed local interest rates andunleashed a flood of new issues.    But the speculation faded in early February and interestrates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintainingthe peg, thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed ratecapital market.    By late February the market had recovered considerably butDai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New Yorklaunched their issues and pushed the market down again. Sincethen there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks untilChina Development Finance Co (H.K.)

Brokers said the market was steady early this morning butbegan to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a newissue circulated.    When the deal was launched the major players quicklysuspended trading and refused to quote prices for their ownissues, brokers said. "We just don't know where the market isgoing," said a European banker.    They said the Bank of Communications issue traded at a lowof 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10basis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sisterbanks in the Bank of China group.    An official with one of the Chinese banks said the deal waslaunched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with themarket at that time.

"Any trader should recommend his bank against joining thedeal," said a dealer. "But there are other considerations such asrelationship." He admitted his bank has joined as co-manager.    A banker said he saw no reason why the market makersdecided to shut down if they were willing to join the newissue.

The post of chief operating officer is now vacant atHughes.  Chairman W.A. Kistler Jr. is chief executive officer.

Hughes said its proposal would have been conditioned on itnot being required to license the purchaser with any Hughestechnology and on the imposition of no more adverse conditions.    Hughes said "For reasons Hughes does not fully understand,Baker declined to proceed in this fashion and insisted that itwould proceed only if Hughes signed the consent decree."    The company said its board found the consent decree to beunreasonable because some "unusual terms" in the decree posed asubstantial risk that control of the divestiture of Reed wouldbe passed to a trustee owing no duties to the shareholders ofthe combined company, which would have been called Baker HughesInc, and would include all of Reed's international assets andits coring and diamond bit assets.

reut2-001.sgm, EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING, OPEC crude oil output in the first fewdays of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpdceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.    The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oiltraders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the MiddleEast, Africa, Latin America and Asia.    They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that thegroup is producing within its ceiling to support the return toa fixed price system, which came into effect last month.    OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpdabove the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by theUnited Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.    The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,was also producing above quota in the first days of March, thesurvey reveals.    But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fallin Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability toexport as much as its quota allows.    Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.    Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, wasestimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 inearly March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its shareof Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by someOPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,both substantially under quota in February and early March.    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"sprices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for anyshortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, downfrom 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonnygrades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudesfrom the U.K. North Sea.

reut2-001.sgm, U.S. EXPANSION THREATENED - CONGRESSIONAL REPORT, The U.S. economy is facing severalserious problems which threaten its continued expansion,according to a Congressional report released today.    The report by the Democratic majority of the CongressionalJoint Economic Committee said the outlook was for sluggishgrowth in the U.S. and the rest of the world for the nearfuture.    Committee Republicans released a separate, more optimisticreport predicting continued stable growth with low inflation.    Democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee,which is made up of 10 Senators and 10 Representatives.    "The annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trilliondlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the dangersignals that lie just below the surface," Committee chairmanSen. Paul Sarbanes said in a statement.    "A close inspection of the economy reveals that the currentrecovery, while long, is fragile, and we are skating on thinice," the Maryland Democrat said.    He said the danger signals included a decline ininvestment, increased demand for borrowing which was strainingthe financial system, a possible increase in inflation fueledby higher oil prices and the depressed condition of thenation's farmers.    Republicans said most private economists saw no likelihoodof a recession and were predicting a growth rate of aroundthree pct for this year and next, similar to Administrationforecasts.    "The economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. We'recomfortable with the current low rate of inflation, hopefulthat interest rates will continue to decline, optimistic thatemployment opportunities will continue to improve and confidentin this nation's resilient, innovative and diversified economy,"the Republican report said.    "The greatest economic challenge facing the 100th Congressis reducing the federal deficit," the Republicans added.    Democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced butalso wanted the government to spend more on education, jobtraining, research and development and health care.    They said pressures on the dollar might make it difficultfor the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate theeconomy if this becomes necessary.    "There is now substantial concern about the inflationaryeffects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetarypressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the moneysupply," the Democrat report said.    "At the same time, the increased reliance on foreign sourcesof capital in American investment markets means that theFederal Reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the pastin lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down."    "Taken together, the outlook for fiscal and monetary policyis thus not very encouraging," the Democrats said.    The Democrats called on the Administration to be moreaggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seekingnew initiatives to solve the international debt problem.    The Democrats said much of the U.S. trade deficit had beencaused by misalignment of the world's currencies, especiallythe overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982.    Both Democrats and Republicans called for policies toincrease American productivity including incentives for savingand investment in plant and equipment and development of abetter educated work force.
