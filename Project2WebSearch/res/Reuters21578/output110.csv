He said the Treasury expected a current account balance ofpayments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pctat the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct bythe summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of theyear.

Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterlingM3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to betaken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well asthe exchange rate.    The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due tothe buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and thecorporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable businesssector in particular.

Association president Ulrich Wagner told a news conferenceWest Germany's rate of self sufficiency in the feedstuffssector is expected to fall below 70 pct this year from around75 pct in 1986.

Helsinki analysts said the outgoing centre-left coalitionhad introduced major reforms of money and stock markets in itsperiod of government between 1983 and 1987.    They said Finnish conservatives bore little resemblance toother European conservative movements and had, for example,shelved privatisation policies to increase their popularity.    Finnish trade affairs are dominated by its special tieswith its neighbour, The Soviet Union, and a new centre-rightcoalition could alter this relationship, the analysts said.   The two countries have a long-term pact under which trademust be balanced in value. The 1987 accord signed in Januaryagreed bilateral trade totalling about 30 billion markka.    Finland exports finished products to the USSR, with crudeoil accounting for 80 pct of imports.    The Centre Party said before the elections that Fenno-Soviet trade would have to be cut because Finland had to trimexports when the value of Moscow's oil exports to Finland fell.    Finnish financial markets reacted cautiously to theelection news, with little movement in the markka or on theHelsinki stock exchange.    Securities analysts said the market would respond positivelyif a centre-right coalition was formed, but added it was tooearly to exclude the possibility that social democrats wouldhang on to power.    The spokesman said conservatives favoured legislationgoverning the stock market to prevent "casino-style behaviour."    He said the conservatives also favoured the establishmentof an internal market between the Nordic countries.     International capital markets were becoming more and moreimportant, he  said, adding conservatives would speed up thedevelopment of Finland's capial markets.   He said the conservatives supported the bilateral trade tieswith Moscow, but that links with western Europe should bestudied. Finland is a member of the European Free TradeAssociation ( EFTA).    Negotiations between the major Finnish political partiesare likely to be protracted, and the shape of the newgovernment will probably not be established before the start ofApril.    Conservatives hold 44 seats now, The Centre Party gainedthree to 40 and the social democrats lost one, and now hold 56seats. REUTER&#3;

Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in themediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day andPort Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.

Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc saidthat with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and theimprovement in the European refining situation, its futureprofits there should be good.    "Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch ofrefineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of theindepedents out of the market. Now with demand for productsrising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superiorearnings," Mlotok said.

Fluegel, heading one of three U.S. Soybean producerdelegations currently on a lobbying tour of EC countries, toldReuters in an interview meetings with officials from theItalian Foreign and Agricultural ministries had not yieldedmuch to encourage hopes that Italy would vote against theproposed tax.    Fluegel said his delegation had received a negativeresponse from the Italian Agriculture Ministry, but that theattitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared "more realistic."    He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S.Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance theEC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds.

"This is thefirst hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternativeto the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal."    The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and ByronDorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrsper bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receivedeficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but notmore than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons notactively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over fiveyears, protect family farms and eliminate governmentaccumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would behalted.    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who afamily farmer is."

Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeksof negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) thatthere would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactionsand a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other typesof business.    The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions todistribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determinethe kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the endof January.    President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he wassuspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluationand violent fluctations of the exchange rate which hadresulted.    Business and banking sources said another reason forsuspending the auction was that the central bank was low onforeign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successfulbidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction systemwas first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.

reut2-006.sgm, LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE, Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oilproducers, announced today, are aimed at encouragingdevelopments in the North Sea to go ahead and boostopportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the InlandRevenue said in a post-budget statement.    Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announcedin his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companieswill be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).    To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on anindividual field itself, when its income stream began, but wasnot immediately available against other developmentexpenditure, the statement said.    The new relief will apply to fields outside the southernbasin for which developmentconsent is first given on or after today, and will improve thepost-tax economics of new developments and encourage companiesto proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.    Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allowcertain expenditure on oil related research which does not atpresent qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRTliability.    This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on theU.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in aparticular field within three years of being incurred, to beallowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the InlandRevenue said.    This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs morein line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned toencourage general research into ways of reducing fielddevelopment costs, it said.    In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mlnstg a year, it calculated.    The Inland Revenue statement also included other technicalmeasures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.    These included measures to allow companies to balance theirshares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in twopast periods of allowance utilisation.    Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefswere announced, while there were also ammendments on rules oncorporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to theso-called "ring fence" of activities in the U.K. And itscontinental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions forthe implementation of measures announced in November, it said.    Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokersWood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefson PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.    He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief wouldfavour chances that development of smaller North Sea fieldssuch Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.    Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fieldsmight also be encouraged, he said.    Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshoreconstruction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offsunder the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.    He pointed out that the relief only applies to thedevelopment of new fields outside the Southern Basin.    This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in thecentral and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper thanin the south and thus have greater capital and labourrequirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.    He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditurewould help fundamental research in the oil industry, althoughthe benefits of this research would not be seen for severalyear. REUTER&#3;

The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company madeup of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi &lt;MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds.   Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost theirstake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.    The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject toclose discussions within the government due to legal queriesover the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministryofficial said.    Although bought by French citizens they are managed byforeign banks &lt;Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and&lt;Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA>, controlled byAlgemene Bank Nederland NV &lt;ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.    CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephoneswitching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mlnfrancs by private tender.    Five groups are bidding for the company and the governmenthas said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.    APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference acapital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, butdeclined to give details or say how an increase would affectforeign stakes in CGCT.    In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales ofthree billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.    A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committedto investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and productionplants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT toproduce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it toFrench standards.    The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement forATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introductionof the French government privatisation laws which reopenedbidding among a wider range of applicants.

reut2-006.sgm, ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE, British bank base lending rates arelikely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct thisweek following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set intoday's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.    The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and moneymarkets had already started to reward.    Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and moneymarket interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budgetmeasures came through, the analysts said.    Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said heexpected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.    "This is very much a safety-first budget in order to getinterest rates down," he said.    Bootle said the money markets had almost entirelydiscounted such a one point cut, with the key three monthinterbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, andit would be rather conservative for banks to go for ahalf-point cut now.    Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.    "This budget is designed to please both the markets and theelectorate. The implications for interest rates are veryfavourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and anothersuch cut before the end of the week," Simmonds said.    Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, hesaid Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cutin income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target."There is no real need to boost private consumption," he said.    National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern saidthe lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased thelikelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.    Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve thesharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-pointbase rate cut could be implemented. But providing the budget small-print was convincing, "and Isuspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see onepoint off base rates by the end of this week," Kern said.    Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pavethe way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumerprice inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.    U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, moneyand government bonds (gilts) markets.    But building societies said they would not cut lendingrates until base rates had fallen by one full point. REUTER&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS, The western industrialised nations haveagreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit forexports to developing countries, the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) said.    The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid tosubsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECDsaid.    The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July thisyear and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixedcredits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct forcredits covering exports to the world's least developednations.    Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculatingthe aid element in mixed credits, to take account of differentinterest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,which hosted the reform negotiations, said.    Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised tradeloans have also been revised with the aim of cutting thesubsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relativelyrich developing countries by July next year.    The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. Tostop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aidto subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.    OECD officials said the agreement was based on aprovisional accord reached in January subject to ratificationby member governments. Some governments, including Austria, hadlinked their final approval to other trade credit issues whichwould be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixedcredits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies toocostly for frequent use.

reut2-006.sgm, DOLLAR VALUE APPROPRIATE, BUNDESBANK OFFICIAL SAYS, The dollar is near appropriate levelsagainst European currencies and the yen, and a further fallcould damage confidence in the currency while endangering worldeconomic growth, a top Bundesbank official said.    Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Associationconference current exchange rates of major currencies "can beviewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective."    He said the recent Paris agreement on currencystabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Fiveand Canada may herald "an era of greater exchange ratestability."    The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set uppermanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed,adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree andenforce on an international level.    "At present levels the dollar can no longer be consideredgrossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies andthe yen," Gleske said.    He said the dollar had fallen much less against currenciesof important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan andHong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary.    But "a further dollar depreciation against major Europeancurrencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore thedollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by itsweighted external value," he said.   In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate wouldhold two major dangers, Gleske said.    First, in countries with large balance of paymentssurpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened tohamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of realincome and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe outsurpluses.    Second, in the United States, it could damage investors'confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness tofinance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleskesaid.    Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an internationalsystem of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating innarrow bands against each other, can be established. Suchtargets threatened to cause policy conflicts, "both withincountries and between them."    For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fundits deficits requires interest rates there be set at highlevels, but domestic considerations call for low ones.    If target zones were established, this would put "pressureon other countries to reduce their interest rates even more,even though this may be in conflict with their own domesticsituation and priorities," he said.    Gleske added, "targeting the exchange rate even within awide margin will meet with serious objections where there is aclearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic andexternal policy priorities."    Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said itschances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on currentinterest rate differentials being maintained.    These chances "seem to me to rest critically on theexpectation that the current configuration of interest rates,and the monetary policies behind them, will assure smoothfinancing of current account imbalances in the months ahead."    Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments hadlearned "that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thustend to overshoot." He said this "would seem to be unnecessaryand should be avoided if at all possible."    Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only ifmarkets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies willlead to balanced international payments, he said. REUTER&#3;

Moreover, Chairman Hugh Hefner, who owns 71 pct of the morethan 9.4 mln shares outstanding, has no interest in selling hisstock, spokeswoman Robyn Radomski said.     Articles in two weekly business publications have saidPlayboy is a takeover candidate because of what financialanalysts see as its undervalued asset base.    Radomski said there were no corporate developments toaccount for the recent unusual trading in Playboy's shares butthat there seemed to be a correlation with the two articles.    Playboy shares are currently trading at 13-5/8 on turnoverof about 40,100 shares. For the past 52-weeks, the stock hastraded in a range of 5-7/8 to 13-1/4 on light volume.    The reports, based on an asset evaluation by analyst MarkBoyar, place Playboy's worth at about 280 mln dlrs, or 30 dlrsa share. Boyar estimated Playboy's publishing to be worth about130 mln dlrs, its product licensing, 50 mln dlrs, its realestate, including a mansion in Beverly Hills at 30 mln dlrs andits excess working capital after debt repayment of 70 mln dlrs,according to Business Week.    According to Boyar, the licensing division, Playboy mansionand artwork alone make the firm worth about 20 dlrs a share,the Forbes Magazine article said.    According to Advertising Age, the Playboy logo is the mostrecognized symbol after Coca Cola, another analyst noted.    Radomski, noting that the articles were written withoutcontact with Playboy, said that "from time to time people dospeculate about the company."    She said she had spoken with majority shareholder Hefner inthe "last day or so" for a reaction to the articles.    American Securities analyst David Leibowitz believes"anyone who bought in thinking takeover or lbo (leveragedbuyout) is likely to be disappointed because the chances arenil." Management has repeatedly stated it will not take thecompany private, he said.    But "shareholders who held the stock prior to all thepublicity have gotten a heck of a ride for their money," hesaid.    Leibowitz said he also believes that the true asset valueof the company is likely to exceed the current price of thestock. "But a leveraged buyout is not in the cards. I takemanagement at their word," he said.    While Playboy's cable television operation is considered adrain on the company by some analysts, Liebowitz seespotential. "They do have a management plan for the cableoperation and the company as a whole," he said. "Were this planto, in fact, translate into reality, the opportunity forearnings is significant," he said.

The Energy Department study discusses several options tocurb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruledout a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to helpthe depressed domestic oil industry.    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that"although we have made gains in energy security in the last sixyears, this report shows that there is justification fornational concern both over declining competitiveness of ourdomestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreignoil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing adetermination that the country never again become captive to aforeign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages andsharp prices increases of the 1970s.    The report said an import fee would raise prices and helpmake it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce newoil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax woulddepress the nation's economy. reuter&#3;

In a letter to shareholders appearing in the company'snewly-issued 1986 annual report, Coastal chairman Oscar Wyattdid not elaborate on how much earnings were expected toincrease.    The 1986 profits of Coastal, a natural gas production andpipeline company, were halved from 1985 levels due to slumpingenergy prices. The company's sales totaled 6.7 billion dlrslast year.    Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an averageprice of 2.17 dlrs per mcf in 1986, a drop of 18 pct from theprevious year. Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average14.20 dlrs a barrel in 1986, a reduction of 37 pct.    The Houston-based company, which produced a daily averageof 120 mln cubic feet of gas and 11,149 barrels of oil, said ithad proved reserves at yearend 1986 of 28.6 mln barrels of oiland 954 billion cubic feet of natural gas.

reut2-006.sgm, U.S OIL TAX WOULD NOT AFFECT PDVSA-CHAMPLIN DEAL, an eventual oil import fee in theunited states will make no difference to champlin petroleumcorp's joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos devenezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.    "this was an aspect which was discussed at length during thenegotiations, but we can say our contract covers alleventualities in this regard," he told reuters during thesigning ceremony here.    Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandezgrisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsabuys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as "one morestep in the maturation and presence of our oil industry inworld markets."   union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement willbe beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source ofsupply with a modern refinery and access to markets.    "we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a timeof protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there areclear benefits to both sides," he said.    Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even withan oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily overthe years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelanheavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities andobtain a competitive product yield.    "therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been aconsideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seenwhat such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impacton today's agreement," adams said.    He said the refinery could run crude as heavy asvenezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without anydifficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier dietto take advantage of bigger margins.    The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd ofvenezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pctyield of white products. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN, The International Cocoa Organization,ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draftproposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.    The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director KobenaErbynn, represented a compromise between producer, EuropeanCommunity, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stockshould operate, they said.    The proposal involved three key principles. First, thebuffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa ratherthan using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.    Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would befree to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.    The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa couldcomprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the thirdlaid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock managerwould pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to beset by a formula, the delegates said.    After the plan was presented, working group delegates metbriefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and allconsumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reactionto the scheme and will respond to it when the working groupmeets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.    Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base towork from, one consumer delegate said.    Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point fornegotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change. Reuter&#3;

The governors agreed in January on a denominator on whichto base currencies of the six states. Any decision will beforwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due inSaudi Arabia late this year.    The six states have different currency systems. SaudiArabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to theInternational Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- thespecial drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar.    Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, whileKuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised byitself.    The denominator chosen by central bank governors has notbeen disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to belinked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket.

reut2-006.sgm, U.K. BUDGET SEEN BOOSTING GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET, Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson's budget contained virtually everything the governmentbond (gilts) market had hoped for and is likely to help pricesrace ahead in coming months, analysts and traders said.    Indeed, in the first half hour after Lawson completed hisspeech, gilt prices soared about 1-1/2 points, an extremelysharp gain in such a short period of time. Overall, they roseabout two points on the day.    "This budget was incredibly bullish for the gilts market,"Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd economist Stephen Bell said.    Analysts said that in the light of the reaction to thebudget in the gilts and U.K. Money markets, U.K. Commercialbank base rates are likely to be cut by as much as a full pointtomorrow.    Analysts said the market's euphoria was simply a reflectionof supply and demand. The crucial piece of news in the budgetwas that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement would be heldto 4.0 billion stg.    By comparison, a year ago, the PSBR was set at 7.0 billionstg.    The lower PSBR means the Bank of England will have to offerfar less new stock to the market to meet its funding needs andthe scarcity factor is sure to drive prices up further,analysts said.    "The PSBR at four billion is lower than anyone realisticallyexpected," Bell said. Most market expectations called for theChancellor to announce a PSBR of about 5.5 billion stg.    S.G. Warburg Securities Co Ltd economist John Shepherd saidthat overall, the Bank will have to sell about two billion lessin new securities next fiscal year -- a cut of about 15 pct intotal new issue volume.    Chase Manhattan Securities Ltd international economist AndyWrobleski noted the Bank has already raised about 1.8 billionstg of next year's funding needs this year via a series of tapissues.    The issues have been in a partly-paid form where the fullprice does not have to be paid until the start of the newfiscal year and therefore they are not counted in the currentyear's fund raising.    But the Bank of England will also be constrained fromissuing gilts in the conventional form by its promise to tryout a U.S.-style auction system in which firms bid for newstock.    The Bank will also have to offer at least one index-linkedissue where the rate paid to investors is tied to the RetailPrice Index, leaving about one to two billion stg, in total, tobe raised in the form of traditional stock.    Analysts noted that the budget contains provision for a twopence in the pound cut in the basic rate of income tax, in linewith most market expectations, although some operators hadexpected a cut of up to four pence in the pound.    The gilts market approved of the more modest tax cut,Shepherd said, because "If it was more than two pct, they wouldhave become concerned about the economy heating up again."    Also, a cut of two pence in the pound suggests that if theruling Conservative party is re-elected, another two pence cutcan be offered at budget time next year.    Analysts said the gilts market may also be building steamon the political implications of the budget which suggests anearly election.    "All the goodies in this budget will be in place by themiddle of May," Morgan Grenfell's Bell said. "This makes a Juneelection very likely."    Bell said some politically popular provisions omitted fromthe budget, such as lifting the ceiling on the amount ofmortgage eligible for tax benefit and some provisions onpensions, could not have been implemented until autumn anyway.    At that rate, they would have been of little use for apolitical party expecting to call an election in June.    Also, analysts noted, the budget does not go overboard withmeasures that are seen as generous to the wealthy.    "This will be a difficult budget for the (opposition) Labourparty to attack," Shepherd said. REUTER&#3;

In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agencysaid mixed rain and snow covered Greece.    Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italyremained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.    Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy inearly April, it said.    Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areasof northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.    Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in centralIndia and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas bylate April.    Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India,reversing February's below-normal trend.    Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in mostsouthern areas, it said.    In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to thecentral islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzonand southern Mindanao.    Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia asrainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands.    In February locally heavy showers may have caused floodingin Java, it said.

reut2-006.sgm, ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS, Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balancedby analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expectedtomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. Afollow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.    "Worthy but boring would probably sum it up," Peter Fellner,U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. "It wasa very, very prudent fiscal budget."    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was awell-balanced budget within the confines of the government'sphilosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscalside, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.    As was widely expected, Lawson split his "fiscal adjustment"between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stgfrom 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to27 pct.    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, waskept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broadSterling M3 aggregate was dropped.    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way fora half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but theauthorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a fullone-point cut tomorrow.    "The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action whichit will have to reverse later," Jeffrey said, though he added afurther half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook forinflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy containedin it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.    Holt noted the "rather loose" inflation forecast of 4.0 pctat end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to resultfrom the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.    "A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,"he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back offalling base rates would have an offsetting impact oninflation.    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence butit was "not a good budget for inflation," he said    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more aboutthe dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was nottoo concerned about a revival of inflation.    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the"leading edge" of monetary policy, but said the authorities werelikely to be extremely cautious on this front.    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interestrates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed anysigns of excessive weakness.    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibilityof the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility bythe favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecastto be 4.0 billion stg.    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give anyclear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,which has to be held before June, 1988.    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that thebenefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raiseduties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.    But others said it kept several options open and it was notpossible to deduce too much from it.    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election inthat there would be no "chickens coming home to roost."    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a Juneelection, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone fora Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.    Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boostto the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity. REUTER&#3;
reut2-006.sgm, TAFT &lt;TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL, Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almostthree points today as its vice chairman and an investment groupproposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.    However, several arbitragers said they would shy away fromthe stock at its current price levels since it is unclear howhigh bidding for the company would go and whether the companywould agree to a takeover.    "There are too many uncertainties," said one arbitrager.    Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.    Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett CapitalInc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating theywere committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast companyand were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150dlrs per share.    The company responded that the proposal would be submittedto the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet beenmade on a sale of the company.    "Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs pershare)," said one arbitrager.    Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at currentlevels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per sharerange. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this levelwould be chancy since it will take a long time for anytransaction to be completed because of regulatory approvalsnecessary for the broadcast properites.    Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billiondlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejectedthe bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternativessuch as restructuring.    Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,which has two large shareholders in an investment group led byRobert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American FinancialCorp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50years ago, has about 12 pct.    Lindner last week told the Securities and ExchangeCommission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.    "I could see if things got really crazy that it might gofor 175 (dlrs per share)," said one arbitrager, but hespeculated it probably would not even be taken over for morethan a price in the 160s.    Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but hespeculated the investor would not really be interested inrunning the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, saidhe had speculated the company might be considering a leveragedbuyout.    "Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy allthe interests involved," he said, adding the two largestshareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.    He said the highest takeover price he calculated for thecompany has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highestestimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said thelatter would be based on more optimistic expectations for thebroadcast industry. Reuter&#3;

The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except theagro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fallin January, while construction and civil engineeringexperienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over thenext few months.    Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, inparticular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said.    Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exceptionof the agro-food industry, improved substantially.    In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised lastmonths.    Production rose in all sectors except agriculturalmachinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and shipconstruction, where it declined.    The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn inactivity in February, with both domestic and export ordersrising.    In the consumer goods sector, actitity rose sharply despitea fall in the household goods sector and stability inpharmaceuticals.    Among semi-finished products, output rose sharply, helpedby a strong growth in construction materials.    But activity in the retail sector declined slightly overthe past two months. REUTER&#3;

He said also at a news conference that he would recommendto the White House that the fill rate of the StrategicPetroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrelsper day.    The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels aday.    Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill ratefor the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept downbecause of budgetary constraints.    Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he mightadvocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in taxbenefits for oil and gas exploration and for research anddevelopment into new ways to extract oil which is nowconsidered uneconomical to produce.    He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of theEnergy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.    Herrington said that before he disclosed whatrecommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industryhe might make, he would raise the matter with the White HouseEconomic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increaseoil production made good tax policy.    He said he would like to increase U.S. production by onemln barrels a day.

reut2-006.sgm, U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL, A White House-ordered report said that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000could have potentially damaging implications for nationalsecurity.    The Energy Department study discusses several options tocurb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruledout a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to helpthe depressed domestic oil industry.    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that"although we have made gains in energy security in the last sixyears, this report shows that there is justification fornational concern both over declining competitiveness of ourdomestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreignoil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing adetermination that the country never again become captive to aforeign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages andsharp prices increases of the 1970s.    The report said an import fee would raise prices and helpmake it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce newoil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax woulddepress the nation's economy.    The study was outlined in a New York Times report today. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL, OPEC believes world oil prices shouldbe set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPECAssistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today.    In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminarin Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: "OPEC believes...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictionsand should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs."    But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level hadcaused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced tocurtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPECstates could not be sustained in some cases.    "For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is nowconsidered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its membercountries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailingproduction," Al-Wattari said.    "Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,"Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,some states depended on associated gas output for domestic useand oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below theorganization's agreed ceiling for all member countries inFebruary, although this had meant sacrifices.    The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,though restored to a good level, was still under pressure,Al-Wattari said. "A lasting stability in the world marketrequires a wider scope of international cooperation," he added.    He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown apolitical willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.    But although cutbacks announced by these states werepolitically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they wereinsufficient in terms of volume, he added. "The overall majorityof non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC'scalls for supply regulation," he said.    Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as itallowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC tocontinue, while not generating excessive cash flow forotherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a pricewould no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.    Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, alsoaddressing the seminar, added that discipline was still neededto prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.    Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageousfor both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperationwould ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, BUDGET SEEN PAVING WAY FOR EARLY U.K. ELECTION, The budget presented by Chancellor ofthe Exchequer Nigel Lawson was described by MPs and analysts asbeing politically astute, combining tax cuts and fiscalprudence which promised to boost the Conservative government'sstanding with both voters and financial markets.    The 1987/88 budget contained a two-penny cut in thestandard rate of tax, and a three billion stg reduction in thePublic Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), to 4.0 billion stg.    Parliamentarians said the budget would pave the way for afall in domestic interest rates and an early election.    Conservative MP Anthony Beaumont-Dark said the budget "isnot glamourous - but it is sound and sensible."    Lawson told journalists later that it was "a budget built onsuccess, for success."    But opposition MPs did not agree .    David Steel, leader of the Liberal Party, said "this was astrangely deceptive budget.    The Chancellor had six billion stg to give back - he haschosen to give half of that to reducing the PSBR, whereas we inthe SDP/Liberal Aliance think it would have been wiser to usethose revenues to reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty."    Steel said "the cunning thing in this seductive budget isthat all the good things will come in the pre-election period -the fall in interest rates, the fall in mortgage rates, thelower income tax, relatively cheaper whisky, beer, cigarettesand petrol."    David Owen, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP)which with the Liberals make up the centrist Alliance grouping,said "this is a good attempt at an electioneering budget but ithas failed in its objective. It has given money to the "haves" asopposed to the "have-nots."    Labour leader Neil Kinnock called it "a bribes budget."    Kinnock said the budget "had little to do with the generalgood, and everything to do with the general election."    Roy Hattersley, the Labour Party's Treasury spokesman, said"the Tories should have used available resources to invest inindustry, in health and in education."    He added that "we know that whoever is elected (to power inthe next general election) will reverse these tax cuts."    But Lawson rejected that. Rather, he said the Treasuryexpected to have at least 3.0 billion stg in fiscal 1988/89 foruse in cutting taxes or raising public spending.    Lawson rejected claims by opposition MPs that thegovernment would be forced to call an election by adeteriorating economy.    In his financial statement to Parliament, Lawson had saidthat "the setting for this year's budget is more favourable thanit has been for many years. We are now entering our seventhyear of steady growth and the fifth in which this has beencombined with low inflation. The public finances are sound andstrong, and unemployment is falling."    He said that "these are the fruits of the government'sdetermination, in bad times as well as good, to hold firmly toour policies of sound money and free markets."    Lawson later said the Government felt no compulsion toplump for an early election.    Asked by political journalists what effect the Budget wouldhave on election timing, he replied "I think we will hold theelection either late or early. I must confess I am ratherrelaxed about it all.    "There is not any compulsion to go for an early election.    But he added that "if the Prime Minister decides to go foran early election, it will bring to an end all this ratherridiculous pre-election atmosphere and fever - and there issomething to be said for that."    Industry also welcomed Lawson's budget. Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) President David Nickson said "This budgetwill reinforce business success. Lower government borrowingmeans lower interst rates for business. This is what the CBIwanted."    "We have always said we would judge the budget on how itaffects the cost of borrowing. This should do the trick." REUTER&#3;

Rostenkowski, the chief House taxwriter, said his committeewas reluctant to back a tax increase without certainty that itwould pass the full House and this would require Republicanvotes.    "Chairman Rostenkowski still says its an uphill fight unlessthe president signs on," the Illinois Democrat said in remarksfor delivery to the Tax Executives Institute.    Rostenkowski predicted the tax increase will concentrate onincreases in federal excise taxes while leaving the income taxintact.    The taxwriters will not consider delaying the income taxrate cuts for upper income persons scheduled to take effect in1988, he said. The top rate will fall from 38.5 pct to 28 pctnext year.    In addition, he said "they don't have the energy or appetiteto endorse a radical new tax like a VAT (value added tax),"which he also opposes. "The real question is where theRepublicans will be when the tough vote comes," he said.    Rostenkowski said his committee will not approve any taxcredits to provide incentives for exports as part of a tax ortrade bill this year.    He added that no extension or expansion of the research anddevelopment tax credit for business is expected since it wouldcost billions of dollars.    And, Rostenkowski told the tax executives that Howard Bakeras Reagan's chief of staff would make it more likely the WhiteHouse will ultimately back a tax increase this year. "There arestrong suspicions that the Baker boys will lead the presidentdown the slippery slope of moderation," he said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-006.sgm, U.S. HOUSING DATA FAIL TO CLARIFY ECONOMIC PATH, Surprisingly strong U.S. housingstatistics for February cannot be taken as an indication thatthe economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficientcause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth,economists said.    Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusuallymild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said thatseasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to theeconomy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. Andafter a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to aseasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April1986.    The rate at which permits were issued for future buildingclimbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.    "February's weather is usually more adverse for homebuilding. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult todetermine what this means for the economy down the road," saidAllan Leslie of Discount Corp.    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate forweather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperaturesinflate the statistics.    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur tobuilding last month. But several believe that rates will nowconsolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.    "Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying'Let's do it now'," said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League ofSavings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply muchof the financing for home building.    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downwardpotential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the U.S. economy.    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in earlysummer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. LastNovember, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated inthe single-family sector. The multi-family area -- whichtypically represents rental units -- remained weak due to highvacancy rates and increased capital costs of such unitsfollowing tax law changes effective January 1.    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.    "Strength in the single-family sector indicates that lowmortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably notlooking at a great deal of growth potential," said WardMcCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together withlarger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrialoutput and retail sales in February, may cause some observersto start waving "four pct GNP banners" for the first quarter.Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP tocome in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is notconvinced that growth will pick up in future.    "The big story is the inventory re-building that's going onnow, not all of which is intentional," he said. For example,U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in Februarycompared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the firstquarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weakergrowth in the second, he said.    "If most of the first quarter growth is inventory buildingand we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, thenthere is the potential for softness in the second quarter,"agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluatingfirst quarter GNP prospects.    Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week thatcurrent data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.    "At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in thefirst quarter, we could foresee production slowing in thesecond," cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and MaffeiInc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.

reut2-006.sgm, U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88, The U.K. Government forecasts that oilrevenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in1985/86.    The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement andBudget Report issued after the Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.    The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oilrevenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remainingclose to current levels, the Treasury document said.    The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall willreflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporationtax is paid after a time lag.    The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel differencein oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mlnstg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a fullyear.    Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes inproduction would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are nowestimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billionstg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of theovershoot.    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion thisfiscal year.    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscalyear is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised164.9 billion in the current year.    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market andoverseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total PublicSector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasurysaid.

Ananalyst familiar with the two mines said "the properties,together, have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a sharefor Reynolds."    The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the risein the stock today was likely the result of "U.S. investorsthat were not completely cognizant of the size or theimportance of the (Reynolds') holdings in Australia."

The contract with the New England Power Pool was signed in1985 and runs from 1990 to 1999. A spokesman for the Quebecutility said hearings are normally held on major contracts upto two years after the deal is signed.    Hydro-Quebec, which last month agreed to sell 15 billiondlrs worth of power to Maine starting in 1992, has to convincethe board the electricity is surplus to Canadian needs.    Utilities in at least three Canadian provinces have saidthey are opposing the New England deal. The Ontario and NewBrunswick utilities said they are objecting becauseHydro-Quebec did not offer them the electricity before going tothe New England Power Pool. New Brunswick said it is alsoconcerned that Hydro-Quebec is taking all the U.S. exportmarkets.    Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said severalprovinces, including Newfoundland which wants to renogotiate apower agreement with Quebec, routinely oppose the Quebecutility's export contracts.    Hebert said the National Energy Board has ordered changesto contracts in the past but has always left the agreementsessentially intact.    He said the utility was not prepared to comment on whetherit believed the board would call for substantial changes to theagreement with New England.    He said the hearings, which began today, will probably lasttwo or three days and a decision made in about two weeks.

reut2-006.sgm, U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM, The House of Representativesapproved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrainsfarmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive atleast 92 pct of their federal income support payments even ifthey did not plant.    The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmersin Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passedby a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.    Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.    USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buyingcrop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposedbroad-scale revision of farm programs.    The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented fromplanting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of thedeficiency payments they would have received.    To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant adifferent crop on that land this spring, although they coulduse the land for grazing or to plant hay.    USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.    The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producersalong the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were preventedfrom planting crops this year because of residual damage fromlast fall's flooding.    In addition, the measure would require USDA to make fullpayment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approvedby Congress last fall.    Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrsin appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in theregion 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.    The administration said it opposed the bill because, byexpanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwartefforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as analternative to federal disaster assistance.    USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill werenarrower than the administration's proposal to offer the optionto all major commodities and would produce insignificantsavings.    USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmerswould produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while therequirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers wouldcost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated byCongress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mlndlrs.    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mlndlrs.    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option towheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceilingon the disaster assistance program. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, NO POLICY FOR OR AGAINST CERTIFICATES -- OMB, The U.S. Office of Management andBudget does not have a policy position one way or another onwhether the Agriculture Department's commodity certificateprogram should be expanded or contracted, an OMB official said.    Speaking at the National Grain and Feed Association'sannual convention, Ron Landis, chief of OMB's agriculturalbranch, said instead of an across the board policy for oragainst certificates, OMB has worked and will continue to workvery closely with USDA in determining how many certificatesshould be sent out in each government farm payment.    "Recent evidence by the General Accounting Office and theCongressional Budget Office suggest that certificates can anddo increase budget exposure," Landis said.    But Landis also noted that certificates have numerousbeneficial impacts.    These benefits are helping maintain U.S. pricecompetitiveness, freeing up storage space and saving thegovernment storage and handling costs.    The major drawback to certificates, said Landis, is thatthey increase budget exposure relative to cash through use ofthe pik and roll marketing strategy.    In the pik and roll strategy, a farmer puts his grain underloan, redeems it with certificates, then keeps the differencebetween the price he paid for certificates and the county loanrate.    However, if the benefits of certificates outweigh the addedcosts, OMB officials said they will support continuation of theprogram.    "OMB says certificates have a very positive effect on themarket, but the question is do those positive benefits outweighthe added costs. If they do, then the certificate program isgood," an OMB official told Reuters.    Landis calculated that the redemption of each certificateworth 1,500 bushels results in 176 dlrs in storage savings forwheat farmers, 270 dlrs for corn farmers and 92 dlrs forsoybean farmers. The pik and roll strategy represents a benefitof about 35 cents per bushel per farmer, he said.    But Landis also noted that recent studies by CBO suggestthat an additional one billion dlrs of certificates released tothe market could result in outlays of 1.15 dlrs in cash forevery dlr released in certificates.    OMB is concerned that too many certificates released ontothe market could cause prices to drop too low and governmentcosts to increase too much.    But Landis said OMB has not determined what amount ofcertificates would be excessive. Reuter&#3;

This helpedincrease marketable supplies, so farm-level corn pricesaveraged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than theywould have otherwise.    The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40to 50 mln bushels, it said.    The department said government spending on farm programs infiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.    During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first halfof the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from lastyear's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.    The department said the President's budget proposals for1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24billion dlrs.    In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remainclose to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pctaverage of 1980-86, it said.    Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volumeis expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in sevenyears, the department said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, FAVOURABLE TAX TREATMENT GONE ON CERTAIN UK LOANS, An Inland Revenue ruling accompanyingtoday's U.K. Budget would eliminate a favourable tax treatmenton certain foreign loans by British banks and may be a"nightmare" of practical application, banking sources said.    This is because banks will only be able to offset the taxcredit for foreign withholding tax paid on the interest theyreceive against the corporation tax on the profit of a specificloan. Currently, the tax credit is calculated against a banksprofits as a whole.    For banks, compliance with the ruling could indeed be anightmare since they don't fund loans on a individual basis.    Many of the loans that would be affected by the tax changeare those to less developed countries, such as those in LatinAmerica. Bankers could not estimate how many loans wereinvolved expect to suggest it was a "sizable number."    In a statement, the Inland Revenue said that on loans madeon or after April 1, the new measures would apply to interestarising from that date. On existing loans at that date, themeasures would apply to interest arising from April 1, 1988.    Government sources noted that the existing treatment ofwithholding tax on interest has enabled some banks to reduceinterest rates on overseas loans, thereby lowering the revenueto the U.K. Treasury.    The new measures, they said, are designed to  reduce thesubsidy given to overseas lending through the tax system andbring the U.K. System more into line with those of overseascompetitors.    The Inland Revenue estimated that the income to theTreausry would be negligible in 1987/88 but could build up overtime from about 20 mln stg in 1988/89 to 60 mln stg in 1990/91.    But while compliance with the new measures couldnecessitate hours of clerical work, bankers said the end returnto the Treasury may not prove as lucrative as anticipated.    They noted that most documentation accompanying these loanscontains a clause allowing for a loan to be restructured if thetax treatment changes. However, they were unsure to what extentthe loans would and could be changed.    Bankers said they would seek clarification from the InlandRevenue, particularly on how to calculate the cost of theseloans. Revenue said it hopes to keep costs of compliance to aminimum. Reuter&#3;

His resignation was accepted during a meeting with President Jose Sarney this afternoon, the spokesman said.    No official reasons for the resignation were immediatelyavailable, but sources close to the government said Sayad hadpressed for a three-month price freeze and sharp governmentspending cuts to combat inflation.    Neither Sarney nor Finance Minister Dilson Funaro acceptedthe proposals, the sources said.    Sayad was one of the architects of last year's "PlanoCruzado" program, which froze prices, ended widespreadindexation of the economy and introduced the new cruzadocurrency to replace the cruzeiro in a bid to cut the 250 pctannual inflation rate.    After holding prices for nearly nine months, the plan wasunable to withstand the inflationary pressures of boomingconsumer demand and widespread shortages. In the first twomonths of this year prices rose by around 30 per cent.    A sharp deterioration in Brazil's foreign trade surpluscaused President Sarney to announce last month the suspensionof interest rate payments on 68 billion dollars of commercialdebt.    Finance Minister Funaro told reporters last week newmeasures to correct the economy would be announced within amonth, although he gave no further details.

reut2-006.sgm, COURT BLOCKS INJUNCTION SOUGHT AGAINST COASTAL, A U.S. Bankruptcy Judge ruled that&lt;TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp> can not seek an injunction inTexas State court to block Coastal Corp &lt;CGP> from presenting aplan of reorganization in TransAmerican's bankruptcyproceeding.    However, U.S. bankruptcy judge Manuel Leal also ruled thatTransAmerican could pursue its two billion dlr lawsuit againstCoastal that alleges the Houston based gas company isattempting to unlawfully gain control of Transamerican's Texasgas reserve and pipeline system.    Leal told both Coastal and TransAmerican that he plans tomaintain jurisdiction over TransAmerican's bankruptcyreorganization proceedings that began in 1983.    After the hearing, John Nabors, a lawyer for TransAmerican,said the company would pursue its state court lawsuit seeking2.0 billion dlrs in damages from Coastal.    Nabors contends that Coastal has unlawfully attempted toreplace TransAmerican's negotiated reorganization plan payingsecured creditors in full with a plan of its own.    "They're not going to pay any money under their plan,they're just going to operate (the gas wells) and give profitto the creditors," Nabors said.    He said Coastal's plan, which has not yet been submitted tothe Bankruptcy Court, offered to pay creditors 50 mln dlrsannually for seven years.    TransAmerican's plan would repay a total of 770 mln dlrs indebts to secured creditors and the equivalent of 30 cts on thedollar to unsecured creditors.     A Coastal unit is among Transamerican's unsecuredcreditors and is owed about 600,000 dlrs.    Transamerican said it is the second largest producer ofnatural gas in Texas with reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feetand more than 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.    Coastal, one of the nation's largest gas producers, earned71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion dlrs in 1986. Reuter&#3;

"He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talkabout an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to theSoviet Union," said Glen Hofer, vice president of the NationalCouncil of Farmer Cooperatives.    Another participant in the meeting, who asked not to beidentified, said Lyng was "unresponsive" to the group's request.    Participants in the meeting included Cargill Inc,Continental Grain Co, Louis Dreyfus Corp, Union EquityCooperative Exchange, the National Association of WheatGrowers, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, amongothers, participants said.    Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and UnderSecretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30-minute meeting.    Hofer described Lyng as "sympathetic but noncommittal," andsaid he thought he detected "a sense of frustration" on Lyng'spart at not being able to respond more positively to thegroup's urging.    A grain industry representative said some participants were"puzzled" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before thecabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.    "There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to theidea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,"this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referringto an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.    This official said there was not a significant amount ofpressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEPoffer to Moscow.    Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman PatrickLeahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such anoffer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phonecalls from lawmakers on the subject.    But Hofer said other important matters at the White House,rather than an absence of political pressure, might haverestrained Lyng. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, U.S. OTC MARKET PROPOSES ONE-SHARE, ONE-VOTE, The National Association of SecuritiesDealers said all stock exchanges should require that listedcompanies adopt a "one-share, one-vote" rule, but with a fewexceptions.    In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASDPresident Gordon Macklin said the group would be happy to bethe first exchange to adopt a uniform rule but with certainexceptions.    "Clearly the NASD would willingly be the first to do so. Ifa voluntary private sector resolution is not practical, thenthe commission should adopt the rule to apply to all markets,"the NASD said.    An NASD study found that 95 percent of the companies in theOTC offered only one class of stock.    The NASD proposal calls for all stock markets to have auniform rule which would emphasize the principle of equalvoting rights, but allow for legitimate variations.    The NASD would allow companies to issue shares that do nothave voting rights as long as the limitation is clearly spelledout to investors. It wants to prevent listed companies fromturning voting shares into non-voting shares, withoutshareholder approval, Parrillo said.    "A uniform rule should be written to cure what has beenconstrued by some to be an abusive practice involving the useof stock with other than full voting rights," the associationsaid in the statement.    Exceptions would include:    -- shares in a registerd public offering where all factsconnected with the company's capital structure are clearlyspelled out in the prospectus.    -- shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisitionor recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompaniedby detailed proxy material.    The NYSE rule would allow companies to have a dual class ofstock only if a majority of publicly held shares and a majorityof independent directors on the board approve the move. TheNYSE has allowed its few listed companies which have dualclasses to continue trading, pending approval from the SEC.    The NASD specifically wants to disallow issuance of dualclass shares where those with superior voting rights are notresalable. Parillo said such a provision would in effectprevent a firm from ever being purchased by anyone else. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, YEN USURPS GODZILLA AS JAPAN'S FAVOURITE HORROR, "Endaka," the strong yen, has usurped"Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster" as Japan's favourite horrorstory.    The yen's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last twoyears has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon,the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrsa month.    But "endaka," like many Japanese products, is for foreignconsumption, locals and long-time foreign residents said.    "It's not really that expensive. I don't pay attention tothe cost of living," said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-oldCanadian teacher of English in Tokyo.    Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by "chatting" 40hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn thelanguage. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiettwo-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one ofTokyo's prime business and entertainment districts, and hasmanaged to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month.    She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eatingout once a day.    "For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comeswith soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, misosoup, rice and tea," although she takes only coffee forbreakfast and a sandwich for dinner.    No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residentssee no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent byforeign firms to house executives in Western-style homes.    The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay theprice to bring over the best people needed to back up theirpush into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets.    "You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney andtrade down. It's not reasonable," said a spokesman forInternational Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supportsWestern lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo.    Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for businesstravellers, a survey issued this month by Employment ConditionsAbroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend onaverage more than 300 dlrs a day.    While the businessmen have little choice but to come here,many tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting tovisit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia.    The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates "endaka" caused an 11.5pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year.    Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly bycurtailing shopping, it said.    To help combat "endaka" and the slump in tourism, the TouristBureau prepared a pamphlet, "Economical Travel in Japan."    It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-pricedbusiness hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and publicbaths while getting a "revealing glimpse of Japanese in theirdaily lives."    Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo'sShin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice.    For 9.80 dlrs a night, Scott Perry, a 23-year-old buddingEnglish teacher from New Zealand, shares an unheated,berth-sized twin-room in the Japanese "flop house."    Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks forwork. "Normally I eat 'teishoku' for 400 yen but sometimes I'llsplurge at Shakey's where for 550 yen you can eat unlimitedpizza for at least two hours."    Still, there are the extras that dent the budget. "I had tospend 600 yen today to dry-clean my suit coat," he said. REUTER&#3;

A man died in Miyazaki prefecture when his truckoverturned, and another was seriously hurt when his roof cavedin, police said. Two primary school children were hurt byflying shards of glass as they sat in their classroom. Theextent of their injuries was not immediately known.    A police spokesman in the western Kyushu city of Miyazaki,one of the worst hit areas, said walls cracked all over town.    Weather officials told Reuters the quake's epicentre was 50km underground and 40 km offshore east of the city of Hyuga, onKyushu's eastern coast.    Maritime Safety Agency authorities ordered fishermen alongthe Kyushu coast to return to port, and dispatched a fleet ofsix search boats to see them safely back.    Telephone links with the island were badly disrupted andall trains in the area were been stopped as a precaution,police said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-006.sgm, INDONESIA TO IMPORT PALM OIL, FEARS MAY SHORTAGE, Indonesia has issued licences totraders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage ofcooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May,Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh told Reuters.    "We have given permission for a small amount of imports toprevent a shortage during Ramadan," he said. He gave no figuresfor the amount of palm oil to be imported, but said it wouldcome from Malaysia.    Indonesia, the world's second largest palm oil producer,earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences.    Saleh was replying to a question from Reuters after tradersin London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around135,000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April.    Indonesia, with 168 mln people, is the world's largestMoslem country. During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day andhave large meals after sunset.    Indonesian crude palm oil exports in the first 11 months of1986 were 469,100 tonnes, according to central bank figures,against 652,000 tonnes in the whole of calendar 1985.    Indonesia is expanding palm oil output, and Saleh did notexplain why there might be a shortage during Ramadan. REUTER&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS, More U.S. And European firms will befalling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash andeager to extend their reach further overseas, according tomerger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.    Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.Banks, steel and other businesses.    In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan'sbiggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;FairchildSemiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which suppliescomponents for supercomputers.    Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities CoLtd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seekinga niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while thecountry's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseasbanking, the takeover specialists said.    Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporatingin the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, allhave foreign businesses on their shopping lists.    Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the mostpressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big automakers they subcontract for as these move offshore.    "The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy uppotential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal," atakeover specialist at one trading company said.    Japanese companies have become among the world's richestafter a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbedagainst the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.    But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs ofJapan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move intoits traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,the specialists said.    Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect morebarriers against Japanese exports.    Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoidthe gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer littleinvestment opportunity.    "Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, butthe recent economic factors have become a driving force," said abanking industry source.    So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.    While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number inthe thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies havetotalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.    Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japaneseacquisition activity was originally expected five years fromnow, but that time span appeared now to be too long.    Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.    A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and ChemicalsInc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, headded.    Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bidfor the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entirebusiness after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate allbut its graphic arts-related businesses.    Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned uponby the Japanese, the trading company official says. "Japanesepeople don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicabledeals." But now after some experience overseas, Japanesecompanies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. "This isa healthy progression."    However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run theboard meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.    "Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing alarge U.S. Or European corporation," one banker said. "They willexpand their operations only gradually, a typical way forJapanese business."    A foreign merchant banker also noted, "There are not manymega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the bigdeals there have already been done."    But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets ofJapanese companies, the specialists said.    Japanese will be aiming for new businesses inhigh-technology areas. "Japanese companies had used technologyand quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviatefrom that trend," one takeover specialist said.    Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. Ifthese succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.    But few such specialists are going to sit back and waituntil the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese tradinghouses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages andforeign merchant banks have set up research sections to act asgo-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

The state-run construction bank will review all investmentprojects now under way or scheduled, and immediately halt thosedeemed unnecessary or with a poor economic return, Zhou said.

reut2-006.sgm, THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT, Officials of five Thai commercial banksare expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cuttinginterest rates, banking sources said.    They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spurdomestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidityon the money market.    Many bankers have been urging an average half percentagepoint cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lendingrates, they said.    Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan andoverdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, thesources said.    Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since earlylast year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The currentgross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank depositand the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.    Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have createdproblems for many banks in managing their money effectively.    Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partlybecause of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thaibanking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansionin bank deposits.    Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts havefurther buoyed the Thai stock market this week.    The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Mondayrecorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.    Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will registermore gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.    Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem willgrow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission forlocal banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct ofbank capital.    If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expirydate, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreignexchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.    Bankers said such that could add another five billion bahtof surplus funds to the local money market. REUTER&#3;

It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profitto 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14cents a share.    But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net financecharges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.    A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraftdeliveries in 1986.    However, the company said in a statement good returns fromfunds placed with investment managers had partly offset higherinterest costs resulting from additional lease financing andother borrowing.    It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuelprices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in1985.

reut2-006.sgm, GLOBAL TRADING IN YEN BOND FUTURES EXPECTED SOON, Global trading of yen bond futures isjust around the corner and they are expected to be listed soonon the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE)and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said.    "Internationalisation of the yen through expansion ofoverseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success ofglobal trading of yen bond futures," said Katsuyuki Okayasu,general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond division.    "But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulusfor the LIFFE yen bond futures market," said Tetsuya Dezuka,deputy general manager of the money market section of New JapanSecurities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers inLondon.    Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets dependsbasically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond marketsoverseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there,dealers said.    Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said.    An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February onmutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bondfutures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move wasmade with yen bond futures trading in mind.    LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futuresafter receiving approval from Japan's Finance Ministry lastDecember.    But futures markets will never take root unless they arebacked by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealerssaid.    Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market nowstand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor-linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said.    "Japanese corporations have been actively setting up theirfinancing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly areengaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,"Dezuka said.    The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanesesecurities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. AndU.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market'sgrowth, dealers said.    Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to bepromoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later thisyear, securities managers said.    The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to applyto the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bondfutures contract, they said.    The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited tradingfutures of designated foreign government debt securities notlocated in the issuing country.    Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers' broker, hasdecided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in NewYork as early as April.    CBOT's start of an evening session, planned for the end ofApril, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a NomuraSecurities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are stillobstacles to trading on the London market.    "Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing aremajor obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE," said KokiChiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd'sbond administration division.    Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanesesecurities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFEon these matters.    Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds withcoupon payment of either March and September, or June andDecember from April 1, matching futures delivery months.    The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July andDecember. When delivery months and coupon payments do notmatch, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earnedby non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securitiesmanagers said.    LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount ofbonds with matching months increases to over several billionyen, bond managers said.    These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they areexpected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to lowinterest rates, they said.    Market participants here expect a clearing organisation tobe set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cashissues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of1987. REUTER&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, FRN TRADING SEEN RETURNING TO MORE NORMAL PATTERNS, Conditions on the floating rate notemarket appeared to be returning gradually to normal today withprices static to a little better generally, dealers said.    The market was showing limited signs of recovery from thecollapse in trading last night and the calmer tone wasreinforced this morning as the first significant retail ordersfor some time emerged, one senior FRN trader noted.    In fixed rate bonds, the tone was likewise quietly firmerwith euroyen and eurosterling maintaining their recent bullishtrend and activity in dollar straight and ECU-denominated bondsalso picking up slowly.    Although a handful of FRN market makers were expected toremain on the sidelines for the time being, dealers noted atangible return of retail interest from the Far East, luredback by extremely attractive yields and bargain prices.    "We are seeing from Singapore, and from Japan clients keento use up their quotas for purchase of particular instrumentsbefore the end of the fiscal year," the senior trader added.    Any investors not buying to their full limit would run therisk of having that limit reduced next year, he explained.    However, he pointed out that mainly sovereign paper was indemand with U.S. Bank sector paper largely ignored.    Prices of reasonable quality floaters had firmed by anaverage of 10 basis points in early trading but FRN dealerscautioned that the mood was still nervous.    "If prices rise by too much too quickly, everyone is morethan well-aware of the danger the selling could set in again,"commented another FRN market source at a large Japanese house.    The other sector commanding market attention today waseurosterling, which soared in line with U.K. Government bonds.    Both markets were pushed higher by an ebullient pound andrenewed buying by U.K. Institutions following Chancellor of theExchequer's Nigel Lawson's well-received budget yesterday.    "This was definitely a budget for lower sterling interestrates," said a sterling analyst at a U.K. Merchant bank.    "It has been exceptionally well-received by the city, looksgood to foreign investors and we are sure to see a rush to tapthe eurosterling markets now," he added.    News that next year's Public Sector Borrowing Requirementwill be held at 4.0 billion stg from an earlier projected 7.0billion was influential for fixed rate stg investment markets.The government's reduced need to tap the gilt-edged marketswill create a perennial shortage of stock, maintaining upwardpressure on prices, a sterling bond dealer commented.    This could further boost demand for eurosterling bonds, aslong as yield margins remain attractive in relation to gilts --often the case with newer, if not with more seasoned issues.    Bullish predictions on the U.K.'s general economic healthwere also expected to boost foreign interest in eurosterling.    Market sources said attention would now switch tomonitoring the fortunes of the ruling Conservative party inopinion polls ahead of a widely-anticipated general election.    Although several new sterling deals are expected, in earlytrading the only sterling denominated one to emerge was a 30mln convertible deal for British Land Co Plc.    Other new deals this morning reflected the recent primarymarket trend with little activity in dollar-denominated issuesalthough the currency sectors were busy.    Hot on the heels of yesterday's two Canadian dollar issueswas a 75 mln dlr six-year bond for Chrysler Credit Canada,guaranteed by Chrysler Finance paying 9-1/4 pct and priced at101-1/2 pct.    A 15 billion euroyen issue was launched for Associates Corpof North America paying five pct at 102-3/8 pct due 1992.

The shares would be offered at 205p, compared with Turner'sprice which fell to 227p from last night's close at 241p.    The group said the funds would be used to cut borrowings,which had risen to 234 mln stg at end-February, largely as aresult of the takeover of &lt;AE Plc>.    The company also reported pretax profits rising to 44.7 mlnstg from 39.6 mln previously.    It noted that the purchase of AE involved the payment ofsome 125 mln stg cash as well as taking on AE's own borrowingsof some 85 mln stg. The net debt/equity ratio at the year endhad risen to 59 pct from 23 pct the year before, it added. Therights issue would cut borrowings and also allow furtherdevelopment through investment and acquisition.    But it said that the purchase of AE -- which was won aftera long and acrimonious battle last year -- greatly strengthenedthe group's position in the automotive components andengineering materials sectors.    In the 15 months to end-1986 AE produced pretax profits of27.4 mln stg compared with 25.6 mln in the 12 monthspreviously.   As the offer for AE was not declared unconditional untilDecember 5, it made a negligible contribution to Turner's 1986results.    Turner said the prospects were good and it looked forwardto taking advantage of the opportunities available.   1986 operating profits were higher in all areas apart fromZimbabwe mines, which were hit by the strength of the localcurrency against the dollar.

"In my opinion, it is significantly higher," Sergeyev, whoworks at the Economics Institute of the Soviet Union's Academyof Sciences, said.    Most Western economists have for years allowed for acertain padding of figures when analysing Soviet statistics forindustrial production.    Sergeyev said about 600 mln roubles was lost annually inraw material industries by paying wages and bonuses for workwhich was not in fact performed.

Sony will have an irregular five-month business term endingMarch 31, as its financial year will be changed to run fromApril 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.

The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recentappreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in marketprices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.    The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.

Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from onemln due to lower exports to China.    Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrssales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the threemonths compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.    Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its totalproduction in 1990 from the present 20 pct.

Babcock, which has set an unchangedthree mark a share dividend on 1985/86 business, announced lastweek that Iran was selling its 25.2 pct holding in the company.These shares will be placed with institutional investors.    The rights issue will bring Deutsche Babcock 330 mln marks,which share market analysts said was likely be used partly tofinance expansion, especially in environment technology.    However, one analyst who follows the stock for a majorFrankfurt bank said the capital increase would also be used tobring capital ratios back into order after the company sufferedheavy losses in the early 1980s.    This analyst said Babcock had used reserves to cover theselosses, which were due to problems linked with three majorcontracts in the Middle East. The parent company made a netloss in the year to end-September 1982 of 389 mln marks.    Deutsche Babcock has not yet presented details of itsresults in the 1985/86 period, but it has said profits rosefrom the group net of 32.1 mln marks in 1984/85.    The share market analysts saw no particular problems in thepricing of the new Babcock shares but said the timing wasunfortunate.    The government is planning to sell its 25.55 pct stake inVEBA AG &lt;VEBG.F> this month, in a transaction worth a likely2.5 billion marks. The Babcock rights issue also coincides witha large capital increase by the Aachener und Muenchenerinsurance group.    The heavy volume of new stock coming on to the market hasgenerally put pressure on West German stocks which have alsosuffered because of export problems caused by the high mark.    Analysts have linked the pending capital increase withIran's decision to sell its holding in Babcock, held since1975.    When the Iranian decision was announced last week, themarket took the news calmly. Analysts said today thecombination of the Iranian sale and the rights issue would nothave a negative effect on the Babcock share because the directplacement of the Iranian holding with institutional investorsboth in Germany and abroad would shield the price from falls.

Stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of the Committee fora Currency Union in Europe, whose key members are former WestGerman Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French PresidentValery Giscard d'Estaing, founders of the EMS.    He said, "One failing of the EMS is important countries,like Great Britain, are not members. Other partners should giveup their split currencies or abandon broader fluctuations."    EMS member Belgium has both a "financial" and a "commercial"franc and the Italian lira is allowed to fluctuate by six pctagainst other member currencies, compared with a permittedfluctuation of only 2.25 pct for other currencies.

reut2-006.sgm, ZAIRE AND IMF IN ECONOMIC RESCUE TALKS, Talks are underway between financiallytroubled Zaire and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aimedat rescuing the economy of the second largest nation insub-Saharan Africa.    Diplomatic and banking sources in Kinshasa agreed that acompromise formula could be reached in the coming weeksenabling pro-Western Zaire to obtain a much needed injection ofcash.    For its part the government is expected to increasebudgetary discipline, which in turn is likely to attractforeign investors, the sources said.    "Barring last-ditch obstacles, which can't be totally ruledout in an issue involving a nation's pride and substantialpolitical and economic interests, Zaire and its creditors arebound to come to terms soon," a Western diplomat told Reuters.    "The Zairean economy won't survive without massive IMFassistance. Similarily, the West has no interest to see Zaire'sstrategic minerals fall into communist hands," the diplomatsaid.    Zaire defied its creditors late last year by saying itwould limit repayments on its five billion dlr external debt to10 pct of its export earnings from January 1987.    The government also announced an end to the floatingexchange rate for the zaire currency and a return to a fixedparity against special drawing rights (SDRs) with periodicadjustments.    Until last year, Zaire devoted up to 28 pct of its exportrevenue to servicing large foreign debts contracted during thecopper boom of the 1970's to finance largely non-productive andoften extravagant investment projects.    Zaire, the world's leading cobalt producer and the sixthlargest supplier of copper, depends on the two minerals fortwo-thirds of its export earnings.    "A young country cannot go on indefinitely sacrificingeverything for the sake of servicing its external debt,"President Mobutu Sese Seko commented in October when heannounced his government's decision.    As early as January 1986, Mobutu had warned that "one doesnot feed on austerity and praise. I have another debt, onetoward my people and my people's efforts must not backfire," hetold diplomats.    Zaire pointed out that during four years of IMF-backedausterity (1983-86), it had become a net exporter of capitalwithout receiving appropriate financing from abroad.    Economists said that since the large devaluation of thezaire currency in September 1983, the country suffered a netoutflow of 830 mln dlrs each year.    Zaire's medium and long term public debt in the past fewyears reached an equivalent of about 100 pct of its GrossNational Product (GNP), one of the highest such ratios in theworld, banking sources said.    Mobutu accused the IMF of "strangling" his country at anOctober meeting of the ruling MPR party and said his peoplecould not long endure the hardship caused by austerity.    Zairean officials blame their present difficulties on theIMF recovery plan's two basic assumptions which, they said,failed to materialise last year,    - a world economic recovery pushing up commodity prices andboosting Zaire's export revenue and debt servicing capacity,    - substantial, additional financial help from the country'straditional donors.    In 1983 Zaire set out on a major economic reform aimed atcurbing its soaring debt. It floated its currency, slashedspending and privatised industry, gaining praise from Westerncreditors and obtaining debt rescheduling.    As a result, the overall economic and financial situationimproved markedly, with inflation down to 41 pct last year from100 pct in 1983.    But it also led to a severe and steady fall in livingstandards for Zaire's 35 mln population, fuelling widespreaddiscontent among poorer city dwellers, diplomats said.    Economists estimate the drop in purchasing power at between20 and 35 pct for an average household over the last 12 months,despite a pay rise of up to 67 pct for civil servants announcedlast May.    The World Bank has released in the last two months half ofa previously-agreed 80 mln dlrs industrial sector loan and lent27.6 mln dlrs to modernise the country's vital river transportsystem.    Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler and its main tradingpartner, recently agreed to release a total of 17 mln dlrs toease payments difficulties and finance imports of spare partsfor industry.    A new agreement between the IMF and Zaire would pave theway for another debt rescheduling, probably at the next meetingof the Paris Club of Western creditor nations, diplomats said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-006.sgm, JAPAN TO ADOPT ITS LARGEST-EVER PROVISIONAL BUDGET, A parliamentary boycott by oppositionmembers has forced the government to compile its largest-everprovisional budget, finance ministry officials said.    The 7,900 billion yen budget for the first 50 days offiscal 1988 starting April exceeds the previous record of 3,040billion yen for an 11-day budget in fiscal 1984.    An on-again, off-again parliamentary boycott by oppositionparties over a proposed five pct sales tax has preventedpassage of the full 1987/88 budget within the current yearending March 31.    The stop-gap budget, which is expected to pass parliamenton March 31, is designed to respond to mounting calls foreconomic stimulus from domestic industries, hard hit by theyen's sharp rise, officials said.    It will include as much as 1,800 billion yen for publicworks, about 30 pct of the 6,000 billion yen earmarked for suchworks in the full budget. Traditionally, a provisional budgetcovers only day-to-day mandatory expenses.    The government also expects the budget to meet pressurefrom trading partners for an expansion of Japanese domesticdemand, they said.    The budget includes expenditures for a program to create300,000 jobs and other reflationary measures, the officialssaid.    They quoted ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretarygeneral Noboru Takeshita as telling opposition party officialsyesterday that the budget should include as much pump-primingas possible.    Economists said confidence of opposition members in theircampaign to scrap the sales tax has been heightened by theirsuccess in forcing the adoption of a stop-gap budget and couldlead to even further delays in passing the full budget.

reut2-006.sgm, LAWSON HAPPY WITH STERLING, BACKS LATEST RATE CUT, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid he was content with the current level of sterling andwelcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut inBritish bank base lending rates to 10 pct.    However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach todeclines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism infinancial markets might push for big moves quickly.    He told a briefing of economic journalists that "I don'tthink we should rush anything." Lawson stressed the themes of"gradualism and steadiness" as economic policy.    Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rateswere in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiledyesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for thekey Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct ofGDP.    Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both madethis month in the form of half percentage point declines, were"perfectly consistent" with monetary conditions now in Britain.    He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supplyaggregate was "safely inside" its flucuation band of two to sixpct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson setno explicit target range for the broader sterling M3.    Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining theexchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS),Lawson repeated that "it is most unlikely we will enter beforethe next election."    He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMSmembership under constant review. But he would not indicatewhat the chief considerations for this were for the government.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said adecision on whether or not to join depended on the strength ofthe U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended onother EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls.    Although Lawson denounced what he said was "the current waveof election fever" in Britain, he added:  "It is more likely thatthere will be an election this year" than not.    He said he supported an early election only because itwould clear the air. "Ideally, we (the government) should have afull term," but events could force a premature poll, Lawsonsaid.    The government, which has been in power since 1979, mustcall an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for eithera June or an early autumn election, political sources said.    The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88"was the right balance, economically and politically," he said.    Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rateof tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predictedthat with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would haveallowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move.    But it was being praised today by political analysts as ashrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could notbe seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribethe electorate.    Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how muchthe PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billionstg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg.    Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawsonstressed that "they are not an objective (for the government) -they are an instrument of policy." Consequently the Treasury hadno precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said.    But "there may be interest rate consequences" from changes inthe level of government borrowing, he added.    Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relativelyhigh level of real interest rates had hurt investment inBritain.    He said conditions created by London's role as a leadingfinancial centre had caused sterling interest rates to behigher in real terms than in other countries.    Three factors had caused the higher level in relativeinterest rates in Britain, Lawson said.    First, control of credit in Britain rested on interestrates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets.    He said the second reason was political uncertainty causedby proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party.     Thirdly, he said "we do not have as long a track record oflow inflation" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany.    Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminentfinancial centre, because it was more international incharacter and more favourably placed in time zones than NewYork or Tokyo. REUTER&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY FORECAST TO IMPROVE IN 1987/88, New Zealand's inflation and interestrates should decline and the balance of payments improvesignificantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, theInstitute of Economic Research (NZIER) said.    The independent institute said in its quarterly March issuethat it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domesticproduct (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pctdrop forecast in December.    Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct inthe quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter.    The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June andSeptember quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure andthe introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services taxand is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87.    The government's tight fiscal position is not expected tochange, it said.    Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, isforecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct incalendar 1986, it said.    "Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope forreductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates arealso expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance ofpayments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, fallsaway," the NZIER said.    Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over thesecond half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-termrates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.    Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct andthe key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct.    The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in theearly part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 onthe Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on abasket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4.    "A marked improvement in the balance of payments isforecast," the NZIER said. "The current account deficit isexpected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88."    The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and3.33 billion in 1985/86.    The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billiondlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87billion in 1985/86.    This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figureof 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion.    "Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued tocontribute to marked improvements in both the balance ofpayments and the rate of inflation ...," the NZIER said.    "Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealandeconomy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode wellfor future prospects." REUTER&#3;

GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day.    In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said theoffer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended.    General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receiptof sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully dilutedbasis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners atleast 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted.    It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeemingthe defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied thatthe rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtainingfrom the Federal Communications Commission a special temporaryauthorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorpshares.    General Partners said it would set up voting trustarrangements pending review of its long-form application forFCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp'sbroadcasting subsidiary.    The partnership said the offer is further conditioned onGenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend thecompany's articles of incorporation and code of regulations toprovide for an increase in authorized common shares, aclassified board of directors and the elimination of cumulativevoting.  The latter two changes would make it harder forminority shareholders to elect directors.    General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for itsshareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.    GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making thevalue of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.    Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire&lt;Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew theoffer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of theTax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went privatefor 1.66 billion dlrs.    GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospaceas well as broadcasting.

reut2-006.sgm, BUNDESBANK SEEN STEERING STEADY MONETARY COURSE, The Bundesbank is likely to steer asteady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change incredit policies is not expected at tomorrow's regular centralbank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said.    "There is no need for action," Hermann Remsperger, chiefeconomist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank (BHF) said.    Others noted that exchange rates are stable after lastmonth's Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank moneystock growth is still well above the three to six pct targetzone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out.    One money market dealer said comments by BundesbankPresident Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorftwo weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut onlyindicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed.    Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany tofurther ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact.    But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed tostimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Tradedeficit.    Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth alsoprecluded a further cut in official interest rates.    Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January.    Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bankcouncil were worried about the continued overshoot in the moneysupply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates.But Poehl played down the risk of inflation.    Economists said the fact that money stock growth remainedstable last month was a success. Some said it was likely toreturn to within the target range later this year.    "The special factors which boosted money supply growth lastyear are disappearing," one economist said.    He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds.    This trend had been reversed recently and with domesticcredit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stockgrowth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.    These developments were increasing the Bundesbank's scopefor a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said.    Money market dealers said period rates remained littlechanged, indicating no change in credit policy was expected.    Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity.    Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments onbehalf of customers had been less than expected so far. Butrates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effectof this month's major tax payment period is felt. Payments forthe federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market.    The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securitiesrepurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening inrates on Monday by injecting funds through government-ownedbanks.    Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shownthe Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80.    One dealer said, "If the central bank wanted lower interestrates, it would first of all drive call money rates down."    Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserveassets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves onMonday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days ofMarch. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected. REUTER&#3;

Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee withthe Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), told anews conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiumsagreed that the U.S. And British companies will be invited toparticipate in the new merged firm.    The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that onlyone private company should enter the market.    The two consortiums, &lt;International Digital CommunicationsPlanning Inc> (IDC) and &lt;International Telecom Japan> (ITJ),were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly &lt;Kokusai DenshinDenwa Co> (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.    Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministrywanted only one competitor for the time being because of thesize of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreigninvestors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.    He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the mergedconsortium at less than three pct and added that even thelargest shareholders could own only some five pct .    Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house &lt;C. Itoh andCo.> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium whilePacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. &lt;MER.N> jointlyhold 13 pct .    ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Severalfirms including Toyota Motor Corp. &lt;TOYO.T>  belong to both.    Watanabe said progress was being made towards a mergeragreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with thegovernment on having only one private consortium as twocompanies might invest "excessive" amounts.

reut2-006.sgm, MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER, TRADERS SAY, Malaysia's state oil company Petronaswill cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) fromMay 1, trade sources said.    Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct lastSeptember to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latestcut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.    Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.    However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual reportthat Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to anaverage 510,000 bpd in 1987.    The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude pricesat 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permitfurther production cutbacks, the sources said.    Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bblthis year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.    Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add tothe tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reducedIndonesian and Chinese crude output.    The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, asthere is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases dueto the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.    In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering twoto three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each monthfor sale through tender, the sources said.    However, this practice is likely to dwindle given thereduced scale of production, they said.&#3;

The cuts follow nearly two months after theBundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than theusual interim period.    A Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cuttingleading savings rate for private customers on a regional basisby 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>and Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bankfuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG &lt;BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire togauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savingsbanks.    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates couldreduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them todraw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, oneeconomist at the German Banking Association said.    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantiallyundercut by lower savings rates because many customers areparking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvestthem at higher yields in the future, he said.    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move morefunds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-datedsecurities to reduce strong growth in its central bank moneysupply aggregate.    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,unchanged from January.

He also told a news conference Morgan had received informalapproaches about a takeover of the group but was notinterested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would notelaborate.    Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness duringthe brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc&lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year.    The U.K. Government launched an investigation into theaffairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focusedon the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and theTakeover Code by prompting others to support its share priceduring the bid.    Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head ofcorporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate financedirector Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinnessaffair.    Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insiderinformation. He currently faces criminal charges.    Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been "one of themost traumatic in our history," but that clients and staff hadbeen supportive.    "I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We havethe worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet."    Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profitsof 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution fromcorporate finance activities and progress in asset management.    Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference theperformance of the group so far in 1987 was "within reasonabletouch of the budget."    Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a newchief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting asinterim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have anew chief executive within a few months.    He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, butdeclined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were goingon to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.    Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down onyesterday's 375p. REUTER...&#3;
reut2-006.sgm, ENVOY SEES BRIGHT ECONOMIC FUTURE FOR PHILIPPINES, The Philippines is poised for severalyears of stability and economic growth but faces majorlong-term problems from its rapidly increasing population, U.S.Ambassador Stephen Bosworth told Reuters in an interview.    "Medium-term out to the 1990s I am increasingly optimisticabout this country," he said. "But if you look beyond that... Youare jumping off the edge into the unknown."    Bosworth, who retires on April 2 after almost four years asU.S. Ambassador, forecast a real per capita increase indisposable income of more than four pct in 1987.    The Philippines has not seen such an increase this decade.    He said there were reasons to believe the Philippines couldout-perform the world economy by enough to continue to generateincreases in per capita income in the medium term.    "There is nothing big and dramatic yet and maybe big anddramatic won't ever happen. But I think foreign investors arenow no longer saying let's wait and see how the political sideturns out," he said.    Bosworth said much hope had been placed on the land reformprogram promised by President Corazon Aquino, but he warned itwas not a complete cure for the country's ills.    He said even the redistribution of land to tenant farmerswould not be a substitute for the generation of new employmentin the countryside."There is no way even in 1987 that thiscountry can provide employment growth in farming. Certainly itis not going to be able to do so in the future," he added.    "This has to be off-farm employment," he declared.    Bosworth said the population problem produced majoruncertainties for the future of the country. He said that morethan 60 pct of today's 50 mln people are said to live below thepoverty line and official predictions suggest the populationwill double within the next three decades.    The ambassador said he believed population statistics to beunderstated.    Bosworth said he expected current high domestic liquidityto be drawn down during the next six months with somecorresponding upward pressure on interest rates, now at aboutnine pct.    He said his predictions only assumed the Aquino governmentdid not make any big mistakes. They did not assume any greattransformation of the Philippine system. REUTER&#3;

Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with theSEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken privatethrough a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.    "Following announcement of the merger agreement, the companywas informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that itintends to seek authority from the commission to institute aproceeding against the company," Allegheny said.    "The company is cooperating in the commission'sinvestigation which is continuing and now includes the takingof testimony of employes and others," Allegheny said.    In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has askedfor information about company executive compensation andbenefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel andentertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.    It also has asked for information on acquisitions anddivestitures, the company's accounting system "and otherinternal controls," Allegheny said.   The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.    The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines commenton its enforcement actions.    The SEC investigation began just months before Alleghenybecame the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claimingthat the company had violated the federal securities laws byfailing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxystatements.    The suits, later consolidated into a single class-actioncomplaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allegesecurities law violations involving numerous current and formerAllegheny officers and directors.    Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked thecourt to expand the charges to include an allegation that, inthe buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out itspublic shareholders at an unfair price.    Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itselfagainst all charges.    The charges made in the shareholder suits are widelybelieved to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairmanand Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.    In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share. Reuter&#3;

Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a newsconference he expected both profit and turnover to rise thisyear compared with 1986, but he said it was questionablewhether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.    He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted lastyear that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecifiedamount from 1985's record levels.    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10billion this year.    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help theparent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audiwould ensure VW got a share of profits.    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own freereserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 yearsVW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to outputcaused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, oncurrency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. Aboutalleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models.    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pctto 59,800 last year.    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottomout in 1987.    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180in 1985.    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in thefirst two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overallmarket share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in thesame months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Salesfell further, he said without giving details. Worldwidedeliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to57,000.    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise toover 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallencompared with 1985's 392,000.    Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead tofurther new hiring of employees.    At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985. REUTER&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, CATTLE BEING PLACED ON FEED LIGHTER THAN NORMAL, Most of the cattle now being placed onU.S. feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain onfeed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattleprices through the summer because of reduced beef supply.    The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for alonger time blunted the market impact of the high placementsreported in the USDA's latest cattle on feed report, livestockanalysts said.    After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed inseven states as of March 1, cattle futures on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply. The trade hadexpected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago.    Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts notedreports that many cattle put on feed were relativelylightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lightercattle into the autumn, rather than market them during thesummer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normallyplaced on feed.    Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult toobtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledgethat lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas.    The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots,helps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month fromFebruary, 1986.    University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimessaid, "The probabilities are high that in order to place thatmany cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go tolighter-weight cattle.    The only statistics available are from some terminalmarkets which represent only a small percentage of the totalcattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbsin February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said.    Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed,Grimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced.    If the average weight is down, and there is no priceweakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed atlighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much asthree pct.    Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerlyLBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainlybecause of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattleprices.    Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grainsupplies are large, he noted. Also, the higher live cattleprices have been encouraging early movement of cattle fromwheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said.    Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheatpasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions.    Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann andGraham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trendis to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in hisarea benefited from a dry, mild winter.    To the south, however, he said the weather was wetter andsome cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs lessthan normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, STUDY SHOWS ONLY LIMITED OPTIMISM FOR SILVER, Silver looks "unlikely to break out ofgold and platinum's shadow" in the near future, although thisyear is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate thansupply, a study by Credit Suisse said.    The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200tonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to14,050 tonnes. This should cut the global oversupply to 850tonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes.    The study noted that the effects of last year's lowerprices were having a dampening effect on total supply, whichwas now back down to around levels of a decade ago.    However, the study said that primary production, likely toreach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls.    Around a third of silver production comes from heavilyindebted Mexico and Peru.    Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that themajority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.

reut2-006.sgm, U.K. BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON, SAY ANALYSTS, Today's modest half-point cut in U.K.Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England'sdetermination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, butfinancial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.    They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may sheda further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.    Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in ratesafter yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stgreduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billionstg.    Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the keythree-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the startof business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling ralliedto four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.    Government bond prices also surged on the budget, withgains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paperbelow nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.    But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to haveplacated markets for now, analysts said. Money market ratesrecovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterlingand gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.    Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, andthe reappraisal of sterling assets by international investorswas set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher giltprices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.    "Today's cut was slightly disappointing," said Bill Martin,chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. "TheBank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temperthe markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget."    Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cashto U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped tomaintain the new rates for about that period of time.    The analysts agreed success would depend largely on howsterling performs in the near term.    Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initiallythrough Bank of England intervention but eventually the gainswould force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.    "The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for thetime being," said Midland Bank treasury economist DavidSimmonds. "But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to holdup rates for long."    Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Centsthis week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase ManhattanSecurities, said "There is another half point to come in thenear term, this week or next week at the latest...We see awhole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks."    Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain hadvery little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchangerate.    Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect ofa sterling rise on consumer price inflation would notmaterialise for at least nine months while its hampering impacton manufactured exports would show almost immediately.    Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as wellas cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chancesof re-election for the Conservative government and probablyadvanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988.Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, thiswas likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominatedassets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficialtargets.    With mark-denominated investments largely out of favourbecause of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase'sMarshall said "Sterling is simply the best game in town,especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong."

reut2-006.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY, Japan's ailing shipbuilding industryplans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks ofrecession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cutsand greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.    The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsoredrationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of themarket which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Koreathrough currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.    The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pctmore competitive than Japan's due to such factors.    The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct ofcurrent capacity within two years through mergers andregrouping under legislation put before Parliament this monthand likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.    They said from September a semi-government body will assurerepayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurredthrough job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.    Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan appliedto the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnagebuilt to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.    The commission has held several hearings with the industryand approval should be given this month, the sources said.    A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with aplanned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state supportshould help Japanese yards recover their internationalcompetitiveness, they said.    Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable ofbuilding ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build amaximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.    This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced mostyards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.    The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.    The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between1986 and 1989.    Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd'sRegister of Shipping.    However, falling orders and declining internationalcompetitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses inthe industry, the sources said.    Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuildingcompanies reported current deficits in the first half of theyear to March 31 and five of them are expected to reportcurrent deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.    The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raiseproductivity to compete with South Korean yards which have alsobeen hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recntyears, the sources said.    In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting infierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. Thetwo largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T>and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> --account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.    "World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride outthe recession as their technology is the best in the world,"said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.    The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's,has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships,and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said. REUTER&#3;

A company spokesman said the company will file aninvestigational new drug application by the end of the month,requesting the FDA to allow testing of the vaccine in humans.    Scientists at the company's Genetic Systems unit created anAIDS vaccine, which Bristol-Myers said produced antibodies tothe AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine consists ofsmallpox virus remodeled to carry a key gene found on the AIDSvirus.    Drug industry analysts said that that before the FDA wouldallow the vaccine to be tested, a number of safety issues wouldhave to be resolved. Bristol-Myers said that by piggy-backingtwo AIDS virus proteins with the small pox virus, a hybridvirus is created that simulataneously immunizes againstsmallpox and the AIDS virus proteins.    The vaccine uses two proteins found on the surface of theAIDS virus. The AIDS virus contains a number of such proteinsand it is not yet known which ones would provoke immunityagainst AIDS.

The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew20,000,000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supplydeficit caused by a consumption rate of 403,000,000 ounces andproduction level of 382,000,000 ounces.    However, world stocks are huge, totaling 2,267,900,000ounces at the end of 1986, it said.    The review noted that world industrial consumption has beenon an uptrend since 1980, although offtake is still 14 pctbelow the 1978 level of 442,000,000 ounces.    Handy and Harman said 22,800,000 ounces of silver were usedto produce coins last year, up from 12,700,000 ounces in 1985,with the demand getting a big boost from the production of U.S.coins, including the American Eagle.

reut2-006.sgm, SPANISH POWER COMPANY FECSA MAY SUSPEND PAYMENTS, Spain's financially troubled powercompany &lt;Fuerzas Electricas de Cataluna S.A.> (FECSA) maysuspend payments if it fails to reach agreement with creditorson renegotiating its 594 billion peseta debt, a companyofficial said.    "We would only take this step in the event of a lack ofco-operation on the part of our creditors," FECSA assistantgeneral manager Jose Zaforteza told Reuters in a telephoneinterview. "It is unlikely they will refuse to renegotiate."    He said creditors would obtain a better deal by negotiatingthan under a suspension of payments.    FECSA is scheduled to begin formal talks with its creditorson April 6, and foreign banks holding some 184 billion pesetasof debt said they were angered over what they called a lack ofinformation on the company's situation.    The spokesman for one U.S. Bank creditor said in reply toinquiries "It has been two months since we first detected signsof serious trouble at FECSA, and we still have no idea of howthe company plans to restructure its finances."    The spokesman said no foreign bankers had been notifiedwhen FECSA yesterday, in an action unrelated to a possibletotal payments suspension, suspended payment on its debtprincipal.    FECSA's Zaforteza said, however, that telexes had been sentto creditors notifying them of the move, which he said wasunavoidable.    He said the decision did not affect payment of interest onloans and debentures. FECSA faces repayment of 60 billionpesetas in interest and 30 billion on principal this year.    The U.S. Bank spokesman said foreign banks "were now more inthe dark" than ever.    FECSA called for renegotiating its debt when the Madridstock exchange on February 6 suspended trading in its shares, amove which officials said was meant to protect shareholders.    Zaforteza said the company will ask its creditors to switchold debt to new loans at lower interest rates, postponeinterest payments and possibly convert some debt into shares.    Foreign bankers said they assumed the government wasinvolved in the control and management of the electricitysector.    They added that lending policy toward the industry could beaffected if the banks lost money in FECSA.

One provision repeals the reserve method of providing forbad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets andrequires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, berestored to current earnings status, it said.    As a result, those amounts will be subject to federaltaxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed.    Continental said it decided to deal with this change "inits entirety" in 1987.    Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitationrules, and although the impact will not be material in theshort term, the Act will require, for the first time, thatincome from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the reportsaid.    The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.    Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, itsaid.    Another provision of the Act could result in limiting theuse of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continentaltakes place, the report said.    This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpsells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the nexttwo years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.

reut2-006.sgm, U.S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING, Recent purchases of U.S. corn by theSoviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasingthe price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulfexport point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.    Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce thecash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which adealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider thannormal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by makingit worthwhile for farmers to move grain.    By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDAcould encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales,where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under thegovernment price support loan program and then marketed.    If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movementwould break the Gulf corn basis.    "The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine countyposted prices," one dealer said. "It should be taking theaverage of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City," whichwould more closely reflect the lower prices in the interiorMidwest.    "But we don't know when they might do it," an Ohio dealersaid, which has created uncertainty in the market.    The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effortto free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited tothe government and remain off the market and in storage.    Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightlymore than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificatesit has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to datebeen exchanged for grain.    With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIKcertificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, theUSDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grainby adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.    A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise inbarge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwestto the export terminals, cash dealers said.    Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risennearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of theoriginal tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening ofthe mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged thefirmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.    The higher transportation costs have served to depressinterior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained bythe elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well asdiscouraging farmer marketings, they said.    "The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,"which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as muchas 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain tradersaid.    But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,freight rates will settle back down because of the overallsurplus of barges on the Midwest river system. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST, The DIW economic research institutesaid West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reachthe 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.    The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic thanthose of the other four leading German institutes, said theeconomy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and itsprospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.    The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross nationalproduct (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract inreal, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarterof last year.     The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in theremaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand andproduction would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to1.5 pct.    Other institutes and economists have recently revised theirforecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.    In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists thatthe economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demandhealthy but foreign demand weak.    DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand forcapital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumergoods, not between foreign and domestic demand.    It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had beenhit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which hadcaused West German firms to scale back investment plans.    Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, werecontinuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand,it said.    In a separate report the HWWA economic research institutein Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fallmarkedly this year.    However, the nominal trade surplus would show little changefrom 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a furtherimprovement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 comparedwith 1986, it said.

reut2-006.sgm, UK MINISTER SAYS FARM TALKS CAN USE OECD STUDY, U.K. Agriculture Minister MichaelJopling said an OECD study which calculates the level ofdomestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a goodbasis for global agriculture negotiations now underway.    The controversial study, which has not yet been released bythe Paris-based OECD, has calculated a measure of farmsubsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, OECDsources in Paris said last month.    Jopling, in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday,suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducingdomestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of tradenegotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT.    The OECD study shows that there are few countries which donot significantly subsidize farmers, Jopling said.    The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies forthe years 1979 through 1981.    Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as anegotiating tool, however, by saying the European Communitywould want "credit" in the negotiations for recent actionstaken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.    Representatives of other industrial countries told Reutersthey are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept.    An Australian trade official said Canberra has "gravetechnical reservations" about the use of the PSE calculations.U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the studyincluding the necessity to update the calculations to reflectrecent changes in farm programs worldwide.

reut2-006.sgm, FRANCE ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT, The government announced a three billionfranc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculationamong political and economic analysts that it is positioningitself for a period of economic reflation.    The package presented to the cabinet of Prime MinisterJacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister PhilippeSeguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franccontingency fund announced on February 25.    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out areflationary program.    Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work formore than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one thirdof French unemployed, government figures show.    The main measures of the employment program give employersfinancial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of atleast two years and stress retraining to help the long-termunemployed return to the labour market.    Training subsidies and exemptions from social securitycontributions are the main incentives for employers.    "Companies tell us that we have to give them a strongincentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labourmarket and that's why the proposals...Are costly," an aide toSeguin said.    The analysts said speculation the government is consideringa reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman DenisBaudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generallyagreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.    He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling outeconomic stimulation despite the government's revision of its1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.    Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin'sremarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulatethe economy through a boost to consumer spending althoughgovernment policy allowed for increased industrial investmentfrom the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.    The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenuefrom privatisation, to be split between repaying national debtand providing state enterprises with fresh capital.    Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possiblyreflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition onsocial issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.     Divisions began to show last December, when a wave ofstrikes led by transport workers paralysed the country anddrove the government into a new mood of conciliation withlabour.     Officials said that after the success of the privatisationof Cie de Saint Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas&lt;PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-yearprivatisation program with the aim of completing a third of itthis year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in1988.    The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgetedrevenue to boost industrial and research investment andspending on infrastructure such as the national motorwaynetwork.   The government also today revived a proposal, blocked lastyear by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encouragemore flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs byimproving the competitiveness of French industry.    The proposals allowing night-shift work by women andvariations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be putto parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoedfor procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council ofState.

The May one preferred stock redemption will save about 50mln dlrs in dividends annually and will bring ATT's total debtand preferred stock reduction to more than 2.5 billion dlrssince the beginning of 1986, Predergast said.    ATT said it is required by the issues' terms to redeem300,000 shares each year as well as providing for the optionalredemption of additional shares.    The company said it will redeem 600,000 shares of the 3.64dlrs preferred issue for 50 dlrs per share and 7.3 mln sharesof the issue for 50 dlrs per share plus a premium of 2.18 dlrsper share.    ATT said it will redeem each of the 3.74 dlrs preferredshares 50 dlrs a share plus a premium of 2.35 dlrs a share.    After the redemption, 600,000 shares of each issue willremain outstanding, ATT said.    ATT said it will select the redeemable shares by lotaccording to the issues' terms, adding that the record date fordetermining the redeemable shares will be March 26, 1987.    The company said it will pay the May 1 dividend for allpreferred shares, including those being redeemed, in a normalway to shareholders of record as of March 31, 1987.

He said it was too soon to say what the Administrationpolicy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there wouldbe opposition to tax changes.

reut2-006.sgm, SUDANESE MINISTER PREDICTS DEBT DIFFICULTIES, Sudan will find it difficult to meetscheduled debt repayments over the next five years, FinanceMinister Beshir Omer has told parliament..    He said Sudan's foreign debt rose to 10.6 billion dlrs atthe end of last year, an increase of 300 mln from 1985.    Omer said it "will be difficult, if not impossible" for Sudanto pay a scheduled 4.17 billion dlrs in principal and interestpayments over the next five years.    He said Sudan had reached agreement with the Soviet Unionand its East European allies to service half of its debts tothem in commodities, with the rest in hard currency.    Western diplomatic and official sources in Khartoum say 32pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is to the Soviet Union, theEastern bloc and Arab countries.    Sudan is 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears to theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), which last year declared itineligible for fresh loans.    The sources said Sudan, hit by a slump in export earningsand remittances from expatriate workers, had an annual debtliability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June30.    Sudan, its Treasury depleted by nearly four years of civilwar in the south and the aftermath of the devastating 1984-85drought, has a budget deficit of 2.86 billion pounds thisfiscal year.    Diplomatic and official sources said Sudan was now onlyservicing debts owed to creditors bound by regulations banningthem from extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears.    They said these included the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment, the World Bank and its soft loan affiliate, theInternational Development Agency.    Sudan reached a framework rescheduling agreement in 1984with Western government creditors of the Paris Club.    The sources said this pact was to have been followed bybilateral agreements, but fell through when Khartoum becameunable to service debts in 1985.    A Bank of Sudan (Central Bank) spokesman said last monthKhartoum was negotiating a freeze on interest payments withcommercial banks, owed about two billion dlrs.

Prosecutor Carl Hermann Retemeyer told Reuters the broker,Joachim Schmidt, may be able to shed light on the affair inwhich VW says it might have been defrauded of up to 480 mlnmarks.    No charges have been laid in what may turn out to be WestGermany's largest known currency fraud.    The incident has led to political calls for tightercontrols on the free-wheeling money and currency markets.    Retemeyer gave no further details of the investigation. Hisoffice understood that Schmidt was on a business trip.    A spokesman for the brokerage firm told Reuters thatSchmidt had been expected back on Monday from the United Statesbut had not returned yet, and his current whereabouts were notknown.    Brokerage firms fulfill a middle-man function in currencyand money markets, matching buy and sell orders between banksand other large customers who may prefer to remain anonymous.    The financial newsletter, Platow, said today the stateprosecutor, called in when suspicion of fraud first came tolight on February 18, had to date been able to find no evidenceof personal enrichment by VW employees.    The newsletter reported on November 3 last year that VW hadincurred losses in the "three-figure millions" because it had notprotected itself against a fall in the value of the dollar.

reut2-006.sgm, ENERGY/DRILLING INDUSTRY, The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drillinglast year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gasbubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies nextwinter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analystssaid.    Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity thatis difficult and costly to import in large quantities, couldmore than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by1990, some analysts said.    The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilitiesand big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence ofactivity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some ofthe nation's largest gas reserves are located.    "We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent," saidJames Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. "Manycompanies appear to be switching from oil to gas drillingbecause they're betting that the gas market will be back inbalance in a year or two."    The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome newsfor drilling and oilfield service companies that barelysurvived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs abarrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oilprices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur areturn to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rigcount soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfieldroustabouts commanded premium wages.    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> rig count, abarometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigsactive in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 butdived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oilprices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said "In 1986, the UnitedStates replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and thatreplacement rate won't be any better this year."    He added, "We don't have the options we do with oil.Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity andimporting liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasiblein the next 10 years because of the cost."    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserveswere discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Coagreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for anew cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.    "We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need todedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no laterthan mid-1988," Gaspar said.    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging thatcould last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig countto peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to beconducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, wherefederal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to thegovernment unless drilling begins in the next two or threeyears. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as ExxonCorp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum havealready indicated plans to increase spending for drilling laterthis year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, willspend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepestproduction platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet ofgas per day.    But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas andKansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> inrecent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry ison the verge of a recovery.    Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.    "The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil getsabove 30 dlrs a barrel," said Pickens, 58, adding he did notexpect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.    Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.

reut2-006.sgm, SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT, Latin American sugar producersare awaiting further rises in world market prices before movingto boost production, official and trade sources said.    Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below theregion's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.    The recent rise in prices has placed producers on thealert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of LatinAmerican and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),told Reuters.    However, Rico said, it would require another five to sevencents to stimulate notable increases in output.    "Producers are taking measures for increasing theirproduction when the prices are profitable," he said.    Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continuedrise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leadersin Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.    "The prices are ridiculous," said Julian Mateo, vicepresident of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-AgriculturalLeague. "At current prices nobody is going to considerincreasing production."    Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasingoutput, given the instability of world markets.    An official at Colombia's National Association of SugarCane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets."The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yetgiving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modifyanything."    In 1985, the latest year for which full figures areavailable, Central and South American nations produced 28 mlntonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. Ayear earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000more, according to the London-based International SugarOrganization.    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugarindustry in many countries in the region into a recession fromwhich it will be hard to recover.    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic'sNational Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boostproduction even if prices recovered sharply.    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transportand badly maintained plantations were barriers to any shortterm recovery in output, he added.    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugarexporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the endof the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output isrunning well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problemsand poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countriesunder special deals. Last year, bad weather added to itstroubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in1985.    The low world prices of recent years have led manycountries in the region to cut exportable production to levelswhere they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbeancountries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for whichthey receive prices well above free market levels.    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led toproduction stagnating or falling rather than being shifted tothe free world market.    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. Inboth 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this yearits quota is only 37,000.    A national cooperative official said that, as long as worldmarket levels continue at around half of Peru's productioncost, the future of the industry is uncertain.    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officialsstressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar canewhich, according to the group's executive-secretary EduardoLatorre, "grows like a weed" throughout the region.    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane inexcess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined intosugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and AlcoholInstitute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives fromforeign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over thepast year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meantBrazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments tonext year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking pointbeing how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery ofsugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which wouldcost eight cents to replace.    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar exportsales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, withthe Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages ofeither alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuilddepleted reserve stockpiles.    However, the situation could change dramatically if theeconomy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold littlehope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitabilityunless the U.S. And EC change their policies.    "The agricultural policies of the European Community and ofthe United States have caused our economies incalculable harmby closing their markets, by price deterioration ininternational commerce and furthermore by the unfaircompetition in third countries," Brazil's Trade and IndustryMinister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEAmeeting.    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA forwhat the group charges is its continued dumping of excessoutput on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is themain cause of low prices.    GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement whichwould regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling theregion's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreementwould have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialisedcountries would have to see it as a political rather than amerely economic pact.    "They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay theregion's 360 billion dollar foreign debt," GEPLACEA's Latorresaid. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, TALKING POINT/GENCORP INC &lt;GY>, The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tenderoffer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not beenough to buy the company, analysts said.    Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from GeneralPartners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value ofGenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertaintysurrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges toGencorp broadcasting licenses.    Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.    "The expectation is either there will be someone else orthe bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management'scooperation," said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Huttongroup.    Analysts said there is concern about challenges toGencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radiostations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign paymentsand political contributions.    "I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,"said Baker of the offer.    Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issuemight be a stumbling block or result in a long period of timefor any transaction.    A source close to General Partners, however, said GeneralPartners would apply to the Federal Communications Commissionfor special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.The source said if approved, the authority would allow atransaction to be carried out.    If it received the "short-form" approval, General Partnerswould set up a trust which would hold the broadcastingproperties until the licensing situation is resolved.    General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner andBrown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such asGeneral Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution ofthe challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sellthe stations.    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with WaltDisney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to agroup that challenged the station's license.    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV inSecaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.    General Partners said it intends to keep the company'splastics and industrial products businesses and its tires andrelated products segment.    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, saidthat, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth asmuch as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospacebusiness could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billiondlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs pershare, he said.    The company, formerly known as General Tireand Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would beworth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottlingbusiness might also be worth several dollars per share, hesaid.    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, whobecame chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company'sAerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over theyears and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.    "The management's doing a very fine job in trying to dealwith the non-strategic assets of the company," Rose said.    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, butthey declined to predict what steps the company might take.They said it would be possible the company might consider aleveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and therewas some concern about "greenmail." Greenmail is the payment ata premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.    "I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothingsurprises me anymore," said Rose.    GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retainedFirst Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.    Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS, Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL>Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations toreschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to sixmonths.    Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment ofinterest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium isexpected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talksare under way.    "I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil'sdebt," Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.    "I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Justhow long the run is is anybody's guess," Swearingen said.    Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritoriummay force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrsand reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the firstquarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.    The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize theseloans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of theContinental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to aninquiry.    Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and netincome equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.    Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducingoffice rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.    In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts ashare, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.    The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans andother assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the1984 restructuring agreement with the government.    The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that itis entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate lossrather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.    In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle marketrose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.    Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bankwould like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 itbought three small suburban banks.    Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will betaken over because no bank in the Midwest region is largeenough to buy it, and New York money center banks areprohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.    He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over whowill eventually own the firm because it still holds theequivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.    The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and hassaid it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. Theagency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984bailout of the bank.    Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head thestruggling banking firm after a career as an oil industryexecutive, said he will retire when the three-year period heagreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would notcomment on a successor.    The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago optionsclearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said itsdoubtful lending to Japan will occur because that countrydoesn't need external sources of cash.

The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, headof the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski,chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.    A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.    Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backedaspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under theGATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.    But Denman disagreed with other provisions which wouldrequire President Reagan to take retaliatory trade actionagainst nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. andwould set new standards for judging unfair foreign tradepractices.    Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibitmember nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action intrade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.    He said "If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory,then the United States would be in violation of itsinternational legal obligations and on a collision course withits major trading partners."    Denman added that a president should have flexibility inenforcing trade laws, saying "in the last resort, anyadministration must take its decision in light of the overallnational interest."    Otherwise, he said, "the risk would be counter-reaction bytrading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation orenactment of mirror image legislation to be employed againstimports from the United States."    Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if itreduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier forfirms to file unfair trade practice claims.    Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standardsfor findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.    "Changes in these standards must be agreed uponmultilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United Statesalone on the world trading system," he said.    House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-statelegislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curbimports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed twoyears ago but vetoed by President Reagan.    There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto theentire trade bill because of the textile amendment.    Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS, The 1988 agriculture budget willhave to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, thechairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of theuse of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms arepossibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculturesubcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain andFeed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from theHouse budget committee that the agriculture committee will haveto reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billiondlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to bemade very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988budget, Glickman added.    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.    "The administration's target price proposals are dead inthe water," he said.    To cut the budget, Glickman said, "everthing is on thetable," except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committeewill study in order to cut farm spending.    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which hesaid would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or "pik')certificates will also be another option his committee willstudy, Glickman said.    While not committing himself for or against such action, hesaid lawmakers have to examine recent government findings whichindicate certificates cost more than cash payments.    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms andtightening up of the person definition for annual paymentlimitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements byfive pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a movethat could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he wouldnot be in favor of such a change.    Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly beingused up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expandthis program while making cuts in other areas.    Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.    "I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the choppingblock," Glickman said. Reuter&#3;

In 1986, CPC earned 219.2 mln dlrs, or 2.30 dlrs a share,on revenues of 4.55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142mln dlrs or 1.46 dlrs on sales of 4.21 billion dlrs in 1985.The share figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid inJanuary.

reut2-006.sgm, U.S. ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH, The U.S. oil and gas industry is inbetter health than it was a year ago, according to testimonygiven to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state ofthe industry hearing today.     The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gasindustry, heard testimony from a number of high-level companyexecutives reflecting a belief that the recent industrydownturn had bottomed out.     "The attitude expressed here today so far is a great dealmore optimistic (than last year)," Commissioner James E. (Jim)Nugent told Reuters.     "It reflects their (the executives) belief that they areseeing the bottom of the economic cycle," he added, "and withjust a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to moveagain."     The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oilprices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 toas low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied toaround 18 dlrs a barrel.     At the same time, a number of company executives testifiedthat the nation's domestic exploration and production segmentwas still hurting and in need of government help.     Production costs are considerably higher in the UnitedStates than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fellmany domestic producers were forced to shut down theiroperations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigsoperating in the United States compared with an average ofnearly 2,000 in 1985.     Citing a study released yesterday by the Department ofEnergy, many said the falling production of domestic oilcoupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growingdependency on imports, particularly from the politicallyvolatile Middle East.     "In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lowerprices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day(bpd)," said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the SupplyDepartment at Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, the nation's largest oilcompany.     At the same time, Simon said "U.S. oil production declinedby 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years," and "netpetroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd."     Noting that while oil prices were expected to remainbetween 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability tocontrol production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at1986 levels, leading to "a significant amount of spareworldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd."     He said the surplus capacity would lead to continuedvolatility and called for "governmental and regulatory policiesin support of the domestic petroleum industry."     Citing the costs recently imposed by the federalgovernment through the 1986 tax code changes and "Superfund"legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfallprofits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved accessto federal lands for oil and gas exploration.     Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in theindustry have called for as a way of building up the nation'sdomestic operations before imports reach such a level thatnational security might be compromised.     In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said importscould make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding thatPersian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of thefree world's total oil consumption by that date.     Arguing that "oil is a political tool in every nation onearth," Frank Pitts, chairman of &lt;Pitts Oil Co>, today calledfor a variable oil import fee, among other measures, "beforethe treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible andour national security is compromised."     Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co,agreed, saying that like many federal government programs thatwere set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a"shambles."     Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future."For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst isover," he said.     Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refiningand Marketing Co, said he was "enthusiastic about the future,"adding that he expected "an increase in profitability bymidyear." Reuter&#3;

It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.    The utility said these totals exclude spending on NewEngland Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricityfrom Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of thisventure as well as owning 51 pct of the project.    The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mlndlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmissionlines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.    New England Electric said internally generated funds willcover all of its power plant construction costs this year and65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units planto spend in 1987.    The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs onits oil and gas activities this year, adding internallygenerated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.    New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrsworth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additionalhigher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unitplans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this yearas well.    The company said it does not plan to offer common sharesthis year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raiseabout 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under itsdividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.    President Samuel Huntington told the analysts theconstruction spending projection is based on the expectationthat demand for electricity in the New England electric systemwill grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.    However, the utility cannot ignore the potential forsharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.    He attributed this growth to declining electricity pricesand a strong New England economy.    Huntington said New England Elecetric has "all but rejectednew coal fired plants" to supply additional power.    He said the most attractive new power supplies are thosewith short lead times which can be built in modules.    Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility islooking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supplymost of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-firedfluidized bed units.    He explained that fluidized bed technology is available inmodular units, adding that Huntington was referring to thetraditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal. Reuter&#3;

Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unitacquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlawpresident Michael de Groote told analysts.    Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.    De Groote also said the company expects "excellent results"in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be morespecific.    He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does notinclude possible further acquisitions and said that theaddition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988through fiscal 1990.    De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous fourquarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. Therest came from acquisitions, he said.    Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this willnot make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.    He also said he is "not very optimistic" about the ongoingnegotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-basedchemical and solid waste services company with Canadian andU.S. operations, from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.    De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of theproposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within thenext 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemicalwaste business through GSX Corp.    "We feel it is a profitable business with good growthpotential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the rightmanagement," de Groote said.    Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.    De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs incash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.    De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 willrepresent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses willcontribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.    The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performingwell and there are no plans to sell it, he said.    He would not estimate the contribution of each segment toearnings per share for the year. He also said that furtheracquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likelywithin the next few months. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, U.S. BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS, Problems in the farmbelt andoilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overallincome for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal DepositInsurance Corp (FDIC) said.    The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1billion dlrs.    The total was still the second highest ever reported, butit was the first time income had not grown since 1961.    The figures reflected a radical split in the health ofbanks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.    In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, whileone in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.    Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDICsaid in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profilesit planned to issue.    "I don't remember a time when there was such a cleardistinction by geographic area," FDIC Chairman William Seidmantold reporters.    He said that while the figures were not good, they showedthe problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole butwith regional differences in economic performance.    Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as manyas failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubtedthe pace would continue.     On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in thenumber of new problem banks in all regions except theSouthwest, Seidman said.    Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourthquarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from ayear ago.    Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs ormore -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDICsaid.    Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil'smoratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.

reut2-006.sgm, U.S. AGENCY FINDS RAILROAD REVENUES INADEQUATE, The Interstate Commerce Commission(ICC), which regulates interstate freight rail service,concluded that none of the 24 largest U.S. freight railroadshad adequate revenues in 1985.    The finding is important because it means the ICC is likelyto look favorably on requests for rate increases by theserailroads made during the current year.    Under federal law, the ICC must give harsher scrutiny torate increase requests for railroads with adequate revenues.    Though freight rates are no longer strictly regulated bythe government, the ICC can still block a newly proposed rateif it finds it to be unreasonable.    In past efforts at calculating revenue adequacy, the ICChas been accused of favoritism by both the railroad industryand shippers. This year, the ICC used a new approach but two offive commissioners nonetheless voted against the finding.    "For the period from 1979 to the present, railroad returnshave fallen well short of their cost of capital, howeverdefined," commented ICC Chairman Heather Gradison, who votedwith the majority.    The ICC concluded that the freight railroads with thehighest rates of return on investment were the Chesepeake andOhio with an 11.1 pct rate, the Burlington Northern with a 10.3pct rate, the Kansas City Southern with a 9.2 pct rate, and andthe Norfolk and Western with a 9.1 pc rate.

Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pctrise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due togreater domestic business and wider margins on schillinginterest rates.    The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividendto 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capitalfrom 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.    Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: "We will endeavourto maintain the higher dividend in 1987."    Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreigncurrency business last year accounted for some 37 pct ofbalance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.    Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign businesschiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which iseffectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wipedsome 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.    Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits fromthe bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but saidthat it came close to one mln stg.    On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pctto 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.    According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due tolower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, TRIPLE WITCHING ISSUE OVERHANGS FUTURES MEETING, Leaders of the major U.S.commodity exchanges and their federal regulators begin athree-day meeting here tomorrow satisfied with the industry'sgrowth but uncertain about their futures.    An estimated 1,200 industry officials are expected toattend the annual gathering hosted by the Futures IndustryAssociation, FIA.    The satisfaction comes from the dramatic expansion of theU.S. futures and options industries over the last decade.    The uncertainty surrounding this year's meeting stemslargely from a pervasive sense that the potential for majormarket disruption stalks the futures, options and equityindustries.    This bucolic resort will provide an ironic backdrop as thefinancial industry's chiefs anxiously observe this quarter'striple witching hour, March 20, when price gyrations threatento rock markets.    Triple witching occurs when stock index futures and optionsand individual stock options expire simultaneously.    The quarterly phenomenon has been marked by pricevolatility as arbitrageurs have shifted investments betweenstocks and their derivative instruments.    In an effort to quell price fluctuations, the ChicagoMercantile Exchange, CME, home of the Standard and Poor's 500stock index futures contract, recently announced plans to movethe contract's settlement to the morning of the quarterlyexpiration day from the afternoon.    The New York Stock Exchange this Friday intends toimplement stricter procedures requiring members to submit allmarket-on-close orders in 50 blue-chip stocks by 1530 EST.    Despite these efforts to ensure smoother contractexpirations, there is a sense more might have to be done toavert an uncontrollable fall in prices someday.    Looming over the exchanges are the twin threats offortified federal regulation and congressional action to strapmarket activity.    Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, Chairman SusanPhillips has said the current regulatory structure is adequateto cope with intermarket arbitrage, but that she expects newsurveillance procedures and enhanced cooperation with theSecurities and Exchange Commission, SEC.    SEC Chairman John Shad, voicing concern over pricevolatility associated with program trading, has resurrected aproposal, opposed by CFTC officials, to give federal regulatorscontrol over the setting of futures margins.    Some contend that because futures margins are low relativeto stock margins, portfolio managers have a tendency to shiftout of stock index futures in a falling stock market, hasteninga downward price spiral.    Absent from this week's meeting will be a key congressionalplayer -- Rep. John Dingell (D-Mi.), chairman of the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee and head of a subcommitteeresponsible for overseeing the SEC.    Dingell has promised to look into program trading andexplore ways of insuring investors and hedgers against marketdisruptions. He is interested in reviewing margins and dualtrading, a practice that allows futures brokers to trade fortheir own account before placing customers' orders.    Recently, a group of CME members, concerned over theperception of abuse of dual trading, proposed banning thepractice. The CME board responded with a plan that wouldrestrict, but not ban, the activity.    The meeting will also be attended by regulators fromAustralia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, New Zealand andSingapore. Their appearance coincides with a controversial CFTCproposal to adopt new regulations over the trading of foreignfutures and options on U.S. exchanges.    The U.S. exchanges oppose the proposed regulations on thegrounds they would prove unnecessarily burdensome.    Other areas of disagreement between the CFTC and theexchanges include the requirement that the exchanges implementstrict, one-minute audit trails by this summer, proposals torevise federal limits on speculative positions and thedefinition of hedging, and CFTC efforts to determine which newinstruments must be traded on regulated exchanges.

reut2-006.sgm, AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY, Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlracquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC> Canadian unit hasdramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry,largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, companyofficials and analysts said.    State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's secondlargest overnight courier business just two months afteranother Canadian company, &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved theacquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from NewJersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC>.    But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted byfinancial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companiesand likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying outforeign owned courier operations.    "It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people atthe right time," McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analystTony Hine commented.    The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S.companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-offtheir Canadian units to generate ready cash, said NesbittThomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.    "There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parentselling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either beingunder siege or taking someone else over," he said.    Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltdas part of its previously announced program to sell off fouroperating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, GelcoExpress marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.    The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program,and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs ofdebt by year-end, the company said.    While company officials declined to disclose earnings andrevenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominantposition in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages aday and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrsa year.    The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unitformed an important part of a company restructuring program,adopted after another Canadian Company, &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp>,acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it wouldconsider acquiring the whole company.    Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a companyformed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers ofPurolator's U.S. courier business.    For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courierbusiness represents an "excellent financial investment" in amarket it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesmanEsther Szynkarsky said.    The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake inEMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.    It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky saidthe two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, andthe two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.    She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy ofseeking attractive investments that compliment its main airlinebusiness.    Gelco will continue to operate with current management,independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada alreadyoperates its own air cargo business that includes a smalldoor-to-door courier operation.    "They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doingwell in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keepit," Szynkarsky said.    Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian unitswill likely retain operating links with their U.S. deliverynetwork, generating traffic for the former parent companieswithout them having to tie up capital in Canada.    "The nature of the business is that incremental traffic isincremental revenue," Hine said.    "It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put inplace the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuffthrough, the more money you make," he added. Reuter&#3;

In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meetingbetween the copper industry and the LME to discuss the newclearing house system, industry expressed grave concern aboutlatest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cashcleared market to replace the planned clearing system whichwill retain the prompt date settlement basis.    Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change(the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamentalchange in the function of the LME and in its service to theindustry, the release said.    By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging andphysical needs it would remove many of the unique advantagescurrently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable fromnon-trade orientated markets such as Comex.    The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience shouldtake a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industrydelegates said.    The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that nochange would be made to the clearing system planned to start onMay 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be givenin due course to the cash clearing proposal, made byAmalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.    A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assuranceof permanence in the new clearing system would remove industryfears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process ofreview and change, the press release said.

Central bank general manager Hector Neyra told reportersmany of the credits were 90-day.    Trade credits were 210 mln dlrs when Garcia took office in1985 announcing a tough stance limiting foreign debt repaymentsto 10 pct of export earnings.

reut2-006.sgm, SHEARSON SELLS NEW CDS FOR JAPANESE BANKS, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said ithas sold a new type of certificate of deposit designed toprovide top-rated Japanese banks with broader access to theU.S. money markets.    The investment banker said its variable money marketcertificates of deposit are structured as traditional floatingrate CDs, with the rate based on the AA commercial papercomposite rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    Shearson said it offered the novel CDs yesterday to mostlyinstitutional investors. The series totaled 500 mln dlrs andwas oversubscribed with nearly two billion dlrs in bids.    The first banks to issue the variable money market CDs wereSanwa Bank Ltd, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd, Dai-IchiKangyo Bank Ltd, Fuji Bank Ltd and Sumitomo Bank Ltd, each withtranches of 100 mln dlrs, Shearson detailed.    The investment banking firm said another series of variablemoney market CDs is planned for April.    "The variable money market CDs provide a low costdependable source of funds for issuing Japanese banks," saidRobert Shapiro, executive vice president with Shearson LehmanCommercial Paper Inc. "The instrument enables banks todiversify their funding base in a significant way."    In yesterday's series, the issuing banks' coupon rates wereset at the commercial bank composite rate plus a spread whichis expected to equal an all-in-cost of LIBOR minus 10 basispoints, Shearson said.    The rate will be reset monthly or quarterly and will besubject to a maximum of LIBOR and a minimum of the New YorkFed's commercial paper composite rate.    Shearson stressed, however, that the spread over thecommercial paper index to be paid by an issuing bank will bedetermined by investor demand. It added that other Japanesebanks may participate in future issues.    "For the first time, they (the banks) will gain access notonly to traditional CD investors but also to commercial paperinvestors at rates which are competitive with traditionalfloating rate CDs," said Michael Balaban, a vice president withShearson's commercial paper unit.    He added, "For U.S. investors, the CDs are attractivebecause they are domestically issued paper with competitiverates offered by AAA-rated Japanese banks."    Balaban noted that several fiduciary investors and moneymarket funds which had never previously purchased Japanese bankpaper submitted bids during yesterday's sale. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U.S. OIL INDUSTRY, The U.S. Congress and the oil industryare deeply divided on ways the government should assist theindustry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and thesubsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.    "The industry is deeply divided between those who support anoil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,"said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy ResearchAssociates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.Congress on energy issues.    Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for taxincentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.    Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he willpropose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and naturalgas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration forconsideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theproposal would be reviewed.    Herrington said, "I would like to shoot for one mln barrelsa day (addition) to U.S. production." U.S. oil output was off to8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from lastyear, the American Petroleum Institute said.    Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to averageabout 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that amove above that level will be unlikey for the near term.    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that"even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we'veonly altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs forthe year."    Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling andexploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil outputwill not take place as the companies are waiting for stableprices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.    John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony toCongress said "The continuing decline in U.S. oil production isvirtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. Butthe future rate of decline is very much a function of world oilprices and U.S. government policy."    Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oilproduction but would only work over time.    "Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probablybe a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase butwould not raise energy costs." Lichtblau said.    But the small independent oil companies who do much of thedrilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate reliefwhich could be brought on by an oil import fee.    Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the InternationalAssociation of Drilling Contractors, said, "The members of ourtrade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oilimport fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect ournation." The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oilservice companies.    The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import feewill face a stiff uphill battle.    Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January bya former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oilimport fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as ameans of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.     At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyedopposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff wouldhurt consumers and some regional interests.    But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could growif production continued to fall and imports to rise.    Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements"is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move abovethat level, a fee may not be legislated but there willcertainly be pressure for some form of action."     But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, "a 50 pctrate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.    In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energyrequirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL, Argentine grain growers reducedtheir estimates for maize and soybean production in the currentharvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reachbetween 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnesestimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated inmid-February.    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, accordingto official figures, and would be a new record.    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was arecord 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pctcompared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.    The change in yield estimates is due to very hightemperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year inthe soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe andnorthern Buenos Aires province.    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybeanpods empty, especially in Cordoba.    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, sincerainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak inBuenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. Therewas no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields wereable to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recentweeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,sunflower and sorghum harvesting.    Crops were considered in generally good condition, thoughit is still too early to judge whether the intense rains ofrecent weeks caused any long-term damage.    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of thetotal area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.    Total production for the current maize harvest is expectedto reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mlntonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pctlower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,according to official figures.    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct oftotal planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was twoto 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.    The current harvest's volume was again expected to bebetween 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower thanlast harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers fearedthat heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll oncrops and, consequently, on total production volume.    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct oftotal planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mlnhectares planted in the previous harvest.    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvestremained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mlntonnes. Reuter&#3;
reut2-006.sgm, FED APPROVES CHASE MANHATTAN COMMERCIAL DEALING, The Federal Reserve Board hasapproved the application of Chase Manhattan Corp to engage inunderwriting and dealing in commercial paper of ChaseCommercial Corp, the lending subsidiary of the parent bankholding company.    The Fed order said Chase Manhattan's application wasconsistent with sound banking practices and existing laws. Butit added a bill adopted by the Senate Banking Committee lastweek could affect Chase Manhattan if it becomes law and mightforce it eventually to cease commercial paper underwritingactivities.     The Fed said the application was similar to that ofBankers Trust to engage in commercial paper placement that wasapproved last December.    Chase Manhattan Corp, with consolidated assets of 90billion dlrs, is the second largest banking organization in NewYork and operates in the United States and abroad.    The Fed noted the Securities Industry Association, a tradeassociation of the investment banking industry, had opposedChase Manhattan's application for more powers.    Chase Manhattan now will be able to underwrite commercialpaper, buying it for resale to institutions like banks.     In addition, Chase Manhattan will be able to placecommercial paper as agents for issuers and advise them on ratesand maturities of proposed issues just as Bankers Trust wasgiven authority to do.    The minimum denomination of commercial paper offered andpurchased would be 250,000 dlrs.    The Fed said it felt there would be no violation of bankinglaws provided that Chase Manhattan restricted its commercialpaper activities to five pct of its income and five pct oftotal market share.    The Fed said dealing in commercial paper was related toChase Manhattan's regular banking activities because "this kindof instrument has many of the characteristics of a traditionalcommercial loan."    "Because of its short term nature, commercial paper iscustomarily held to maturity -- like a commercial loan," the Fedorder said.    Among the benefits for the public will be increasedcompetition in the commercial paper market and more convenientservice for borrowers and investors, the Fed said. Reuter&#3;

Baker and Volcker gave these views at closed-door talks yesterday with Speaker Jim Wright and other House leaders.    But the two architects of the Third World debt strategygave no indications they would abandon their plan to promoteeconomic growth and reform.    "They expressed optimism about the current state of affairs,"one participant at the meeting said.    However Baker and Volcker, accompanied by Deputy Secretaryof State John Whitehead, acknowledged there were risks. "And ifthings turned sour, they could turn very sour," a source quotedthem as saying.    They were responding to questions from Wright, a TexasDemocrat, who called the meeting two weeks ago because of hisconcern the debt crisis was deepening, an aide said.    The Speaker asked all three men about the risks to LatinAmerican democracy and the danger that demagogues of eitherleft or right could wrest control and halt debt repayments.    Even though the Fed chief joined Baker in expressing moreconfidence in an optimistic outcome, Volcker was especiallyconcerned about the political risks, and in particular the fatigue with belt-tightening. The central banker said resolvingthe debt crisis would be a "struggle".    Since taking over the Speakership at the start of the year,Wright has shown himself an able political adversary of theadministration on budget strategy.    His involvement in this issue also seems to signal thatCongressional interest in the debt problem has to be taken moreseriously now than in the past.    More worrisome for administration strategists is thepossibility that Congressional debt proposals essentiallygranting debt relief will be attached to a trade bill.    "When (Baker and Volcker) left the Speaker's office, theyknew it wasn't just talk," one source at the meeting said.    The two economic policymakers listened patiently todescriptions of plans for a Third World debt facility, backedby gold reserves of the International Monetary Fund.    The agency could buy up or guarantee developing countrydebt at a discount and resell it to debtor nations undertakingeconomic reforms.    The U.S. Treasury would be required to ask other countriesfor their views under a bill approved by a House Bankingsubcommittee and sponsored by John LaFalce, a New York HouseDemocrat. A similar proposal is being fashioned by BruceMorrison, a House Democrat from Connecticut.    The sources said House Banking and Foreign Affairs leadersalso attended the discussions.    U.S. officials said both schemes are regarded by theadministration as providing debt relief. Baker said yesterdaythe concept of debt relief was misguided. "If we write it alloff and declare defeat, these countries will decay and witheron the vine," the Treasury Secretary said of an end to capitalinflows that would follow debt relief.    Baker has said his own plan was broad and would embrace newinnovative ideas bringing together debtors and creditors.    Baker and Volcker launched their in late 1985, calling oncommercial and multilateral banks to increase loans to majordebtors pursuing inflation-free expansion and open markets.    "They sat down together to discuss the implications forLatin America and feel each other out on the best way out," aWright aide said of the meeting. Other sources said they expectthe dialogue to continue.    The talks come after Brazil's interest rate moratorium andan uncompromising stand by the country's finance minister,Dilson Funaro, after talks with western leaders.    Some U.S. officials feel Funaro's consolidation of powerover the Brazilian economy with the ouster of Planning ministerJoao Sayad is further reason to worry.    Another proposal, to allow regulators to grant commercialbanks more flexibility in accounting for Third World loans, hasbeen presented by Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,but did not come up yesterday.    Wright, who has not hitherto concerned himself with debt,"is concerned about the potential for damage. The Latin Americanissue, at least on the surface appears to be a new danger," saidan aide, who asked not to be named.    There are signs the Brazilian situation and a reluctance bycommercial banks to join in new cash loans even for debtorsfollowing substantial reforms has concerned U.S. officials.    At the State Department, Secretary of State George Shultzis being advised the "Baker plan is going through a rough patch"while Treasury officials are urging commercial banks to adoptmore flexible approaches to guarantee their continuedparticipation in the plan.

Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications forRhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploringthe possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger datefor the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from Julyone. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release thatsaid the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would beconsummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstatebanking outside of New England come down. "If we can consummatethe deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,"Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change inthe Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any otherbanking institution in the state.    He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which onlypermits interstate banking mergers within New England, can beamended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.    If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchaseprovisions.    The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded NewYork as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbledup by the money center giants.    Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleetand Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace ofinterstate banking mergers since state legislatures begainpermitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.    Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposedmerger as "a partnership of two companies." Both will continueto operate existing headquarters after the merger.    Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each oneof theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-onesplit. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving thedeal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.    That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-basedSecurity Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion&lt;RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, isworth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.    Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL> acquisition of TexasCommerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billiondlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainerdeal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC>and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrsand there have been several bank mergers in the southeastvalued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.    "It's a merger of equals," said analyst John Rooney ofMoseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value atthe end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's bookvalue was 28.02 dlrs.    Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He saidKiernan would probably head the combined company until hisretirement then Murray could assume the top post.    Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co saidFleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986on the basis of the merger terms announced today.    He noted that Fleet has a "teriffic reputation" afterhaving diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet hasestablished consumer banks in the southeast and is known as aninnovator in securitization of mortgages.    The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billiondlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstaroperates in most of New York state but not in New York City.    Lougee said at some point in the future banking operationsthat both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine wouldbe combined.    The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a"lock-up" option designed to deter other acquirers. Eachgranted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissuedshares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted sharesoutstanding. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES, Financial analysts see little chancethat U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrowranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.    "We got a little volatility Wednesday," said StaleyCommodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. "But for themoment we're still in a trading range."    Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of theU.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of itssluggish state, the analysts said.    "It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it canbreak out of its very low volatility," said Carroll McEntee andMcGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. "It needs something, but it'snot going to be news about the economy," he said.    Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break outof the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar hasstabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conductmonetary policy.    But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, thedollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attractedeager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.    In addition to a changing perception about the dollar andmonetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinnsaid the beginning of April could bring foreign investors backinto the marketplace.    "The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at thebeginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1," Quinn said.    Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there arelarge amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japaneseinvestment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start ofJapan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bondmarket, he said.    "We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bringyields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct," compared tothe current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.    In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is notlikely to move futures.    The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refundingoperation did little to move cash government securities priceslate Wednesday after the close of futures.    "I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (thetrading range)," Lacey said. Reuter&#3;

Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement(MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation ofCopperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed inthe state-owned copper mines, union officials said.    Other members of the MDP, which includes the communistparty and a faction of the socialist party, took five of theprincipal positions on the union's directorate.    The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) producesaround 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mlntonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporterand sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.    The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union'sdirectorate in elections earlier this month, with the christiandemocratic party holding five and the remainder being won byindependents.    But the left-wing was left in control of the union afterthe christian democrats and independents failed to reachagreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrewfrom negotiations.    Union elections were called following the resignation offormer president Rodolfo Seguel last October.    Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known unionleader, said he was forced to step down after repeated courtactions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.    The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union nationalworkers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCOfollowing a strike in 1983.    The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in thepast 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests againstthe military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.     CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as unionleader when no longer employed by the company. Reuter&#3;

reut2-006.sgm, GLOBAL FARM REFORM TOP U.S. PRIORITY - SHULTZ, Dismantling agricultural subsidiesand implementing international farm policy reform will be thetop priorities of the United States at the upcoming VeniceEconomic Summit, Secretary of State George Shultz told a groupof American farm leaders.    "We want to see the American farmer put in a position inwhich he can compete on a level playing field," Shultz told theboard of directors for the National Association of WheatGrowers.    The global agricultural situation is in the midst of themost serious farm crisis in modern history, Shultz said, andhow the U.S. responds to the current problems will determinewhether the U.S. will continue its leadership role in worldagriculture.    Government policies that subsidize production and exportshave created a "crisis of overproduction," he said. Shultzparticularly criticized European Community policies which hesaid encourage domestic production by providing high governmentsupports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product withthe help of huge subsidies.    The U.S. and its trading partners cannot afford to continuecurrent high levels of subsidies, he said. But the U.S. cannotstop subsidies alone, Shultz said. "We have to agree todismantle these systems together," he said.    The U.S., EC and Japan have the obligation to take the leadin agricultural reform, he said. For that reason, U.S.officials will push for farm reform at the Venice meeting andhave made it a top priority for GATT negotiations in Geneva. Reuter&#3;
reut2-006.sgm, U.S. CARGO PREFERENCE FUNDING ACCORD SEEN NEAR, The U.S. Departments of Agricultureand Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund theincreasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vesselsunder a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference.    Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a HouseAgriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the twodepartments are negotiating a "memorandum of understanding" oncargo preference.    Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of foodaid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to graduallyincrease over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased costof using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the TransportationDepartment instead of USDA. However, USDA officials saidTransportation has so far contributed no money.    The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expectedto resolve the matter, USDA officials said.    Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign AgriculturalService said yesterday the requirement that more food aidshipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult tomeet.    "As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up,its going to be harder and harder to meet," Kay said.    Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and GlennEnglish (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm exportprograms more costly and the program should be eliminated.    In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preferencehave been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests whoview cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet. Reuter&#3;

Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, andparty leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held bySeptember, have rejected his calls for a managed float.

reut2-006.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN PROPERTY MARKET, Property looks set to continue toprovide good returns on investment in most major cities in Asiaand Australia this year.    A Reuter poll of property analysts, bankers and economistsaround the region shows better returns are often more likely tocome from buying and selling real estate than from rentalincome.    In central Tokyo, property analysts project commercial landprices will rise this year by 10 to 20 pct after last year's53.8 pct jump.    The main draw for local and foreign investors in Japan isTokyo, where the top price paid for a central commercialproperty last year was 169,000 dlrs a square meter. A buildingin land-poor Singapore recently sold for 3,300 dlrs a meter.    But the analysts said Tokyo rents could level off as supplyincreases slightly and the strong yen puts prices out of reachof foreign investors.    Japanese investors, spurred by the yen's rise, are spendingrecord sums on property abroad, partly elsewhere in Asia, butin particular in the U.S., Where Japanese investment coulddouble this year to 10 billion dlrs, the analysts said.    The analysts forecast that Hong Kong property prices willrise steadily over the next few years, although a surge inconstruction will limit increases in some areas.    Property sales have become increasingly popular because insome sectors of the market real estate prices, as in severalcities in the region, have already outpaced rent yields.    "We still see prices creeping up steadily and I don't seewhy the trend should not continue over the next few months,"said Gareth Williams, a partner of land agent Vigers Hong Kong.But he warned investors to bear in mind the political risklinked to the return of the colony to China in 1997.    In several other countries, analysts predicted at leastsome rise in property values, which in one or two cases, suchas Thailand, could help spark a construction boom.    Bankers and economists in Bangkok said they expect at leastseven pct growth this year in private sector construction as aresult of government assistance, low mortgage rates and agenerally bullish economic outlook.    Increased confidence in the economy has also improved theoutlook for property in Manila after a three-year slump, onePhilippine developer said.    Taiwan's property market is also set to turn around afterfive years in the doldrums, according to property developers inTaipei. They, like counterparts in many of the region'scapitals, cited low interest rates as a major factor.    One leading broker said the property market had become anattractive investment in Taiwan, noting property developmentyields of up to 15 pct.    Jakarta too has plenty of new office towers. Constructionhas helped cut rents to half the levels of the early 1980s,though foreigners usually have to rent because of limits onproperty ownership, as in many parts of Asia.    In contrast, Australia's easing of rules on foreigninvestment in property, combined with financial deregulationand a weaker dollar, has helped spark overseas interest in themarket, analysts said. But this has not always meant sales.    "What we have seen is an increase in inquiries, particularlyfrom Japan, but this has yet to show itself in many new dealsbeing done," said Allan Farrar, executive director (real estate)of Elders IXL Ltd's pastoral group.    Yields on prime Sydney office buildings average 6.5 pct,and one analyst forecast a 20 pct jump in rents this year after15 pct rises in each of the past two years.REUTER...&#3;

Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, afterrising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a yearearlier.    Equally significant was the decline in both private andgovernment spending, they said.    Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourthquarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureaufigures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and governmentspending by 0.2.    Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking GroupLtd said the government's aim of reducing the current accountdeficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cutimports appeared to be working.    However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keepgrowth restrained because if it accelerated too fast importswould increase and worsen the balance of payments.    Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added theresult was positive because growth was export-driven.    But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given thegrowth in exports disclosed in other statistics.    The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer PaulKeating in a statement issued in Canberra.    Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for areduction in the current account deficit, notably the declinein domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.    A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarterunderscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices andpublic sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia'scompetitiveness, he said.

If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmersshould not be the ones to suffer through their prices andincomes from the financial consequences, the letter, madeavailable to journalists, said.

reut2-006.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY, Higher world oil prices, coupled with anew realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia'seconomy after five years of falling revenue and growing budgetdeficits, bankers and diplomats said.    The months ahead will prove critical as the governmentattempts a balancing act between defending higher oil pricesand fostering recovery through a bigger role for the privatesector.    Economists said oil earnings could recover this year toabout 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product couldgrow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.    But the economists said this will be possible only if theOrganisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeedsin defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forcedto curtail output for too long.    Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defendOPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.    Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running atabout three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on SaudiArabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.    King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC'snew-found determination to defend prices in a move Westerndiplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure astable source of income for its economy.    Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is ahugely wealthy country. But the past five years of decliningrevenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate grossdomestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.    Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billiondlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.    "Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will notbe allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis canafford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worsteffects," a diplomat said.    In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact oflower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing onforeign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.    But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankersand diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness inthe longer term.    It also increases the dominance of the public sector at atime when the government is publicly urging private enterpriseto take over the lead role in the economy.    Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware ofthe risks attached to this policy but is determined to "tough itout" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletionof reserves.    The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billionriyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitlyrecognises the need to draw down reserves while foreignborrowing has been ruled out.    Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudibusinessmen this week the government had carefully consideredthe need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budgetplans late last year.    "It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into theeconomy," he said.    Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction andtales of high spending became legendary.    The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in thefabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor managementhad gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.    Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cutback. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.    The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining butSaudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporatesector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.    Government moves to encourage lending and investigatecompany complaints about late public sector contract paymentscould boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation'sindustrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.    Private wealth is still very high and banks report more andmore cash being placed on deposit.    As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economicdevelopment from the public to the private sector, one of thebiggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channelpersonal savings into industrial projects within the kingdomand refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

reut2-006.sgm, EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS CONCESSION TO PRODUCERS, The rebate granted at yesterday's ECsugar tender represents some concession to producers'complaints that they are losing money on exports outside thebloc, EC Commission officials said.    The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus)per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is neededto obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales intointervention.    The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilosshort of the level producers said was needed, the officialssaid.    The officials said the Commission is not negotiating withproducers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugarfor sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuadeit to offer higher rebates.    They said the French and German producers involved are nowunable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugarwill officially enter intervention stores.    Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be opento them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1and the official payment date when the Commission officiallytakes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.    The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar,it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which woulddrive down market prices further.    They expressed some hope that the operators would noteventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.    "We think they realise they have gone too far," one officialsaid. REUTER&#3;
