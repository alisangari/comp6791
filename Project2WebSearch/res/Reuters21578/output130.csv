reut2-011.sgm, LOWER REFINERY OPERATIONS SEEN PRODUCING PROFITS, U.S. refiners will have toreduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, saidindustry officials attending the National Petroleum RefinersAssociation meeting here.     "If the refining sector can discipline itself to refineabout 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance topull down inventories to acceptable levels by the secondquarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president ofpetroluem products at Conoco Inc    "If not, the industry will have a tough 1987," he added.     Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said thatU.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity,with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the weekended March 20.     The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-agolevels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, theAPI said.     Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp&lt;CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return toprofitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstreamoperations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.     "The jump in refining capacity is a concern if itcontinues," said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president ofrefining and marketing at &lt;Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S.subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.     Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity giventhe current level of demand but the operating level shouldincrease as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter,Buckler said.     Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S.refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crudeper day. "I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineriesover the next five years," he said, adding that thesefacilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crudeoil per day.

Several production facilities were being built, he added."At the same time we are also investing capital in order tomodernise our locations and raise our productivity."    Morita said that to overcome the same currency problems,Japan needs to restructure its economy in order to live lessfrom exports and more from domestic demand.    He said U.S. And European companies had made the mistake ofnot investing enough in the future, which was why they had losttheir lead in consumer electronics.

Speaking of difficulties foreign firms experience inpenetrating the Japanese market, Morita said "Naturally, I haveto admit that there are still many obstacles in Japan."    On the other hand, many foreign firms were too interestedin short-term success, he said.    "If, therefore, a company comes to Japan and wants to make aprofit at once on this market, it is not so simple."

Chiles presented his budget blueprint late last week andsaid he would like to begin voting on it this week.    Senate Republican staff members said Chiles wasrecommending that policy changes be adopted for 1988 crops.

reut2-011.sgm, TRADE BODY SETS NEW RULES FOR EURODLR MANAGERS, The International Primary Market MakersAssociation, a trade organisation, said its board last weekadopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bondissues make a market in that security for 12 months.    Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the partof firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is noformal obligation to do so.    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, inexplaining why the recommendation was adopted, said "It is aimedat the problem of the lead manager who does a deal anddisappears."    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members toadhere to the rule. "We're under no illusions about the legalbinding force of these recommendations," he said.    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts tosupport an unprofitable issue just a short while after it hasbeen offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no oneto buy it back from them.    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating ratesnotes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned thesecurities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17billion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the boardonly applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not havehelped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that thecriteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some ofthe smaller firms.    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running leadmanager during the two preceding years of 12 internationallydistributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one ofeight other major currencies.    The former requirement called for three lead-managedissues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrancerequirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by sixto 10 members.    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrictmembership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitiveand that it reinforces the big firms' already large marketshare.    "Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige withborrowers," said a dealer at a small foreign bank.

reut2-011.sgm, TRANSAMERICAN FILES AMENDED REORGANIZATION PLAN, TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp, whichhas been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection sinceJanuary 1983, said it filed an amended and restated negotiatedplan of reorganization.    A hearing on the adequacy of the disclosure statement isscheduled for April 29 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for theSouthern District of Texas.    Basic terms of the amended and restated negotiated planhave not changed from the original plan filed last October, thecompany said.     The amended filing reflects adding ancillary documents tothe plan filed in October, it said.    Assuming the plan is found adequate on April 29,TransAmerican would then seek acceptance from creditors whichis relatively assured since they participated in thenegotiations, the company said.    Liabilities in excess of one billion dlrs are beingreorganized under the amended plan which provides for fulldebt-repayment to secured bank lenders.    Unsecured creditors would receive either 100 pct repayment,secured by liens on assets, or one-time lump sum payments of 25to 35 cts on the dollar, in cash, shortly after confirmation ofthe plan by the court.    TransAmerican is vigorously resisting efforts by CoastalCorp &lt;CGP> to acquire its assets through a subsequent plan ofliquidation.    The spokesman said the company is confident its plan willbe confirmed and is optimistic that it will emerge from Chapter11 as early ninety days after the April 29 confirmation.    A Coastal spokesman said it will file a plan in April withthe court and will request the court to review its plan.    On March 17, the company said that as a creditor, which isowed 625,000 dlrs, it has a right to file its own plan whichwill better serve the other creditors in a shorter time.    A TransAmerican spokesman said the net worth of Coastal'soffer is less than 25 pct of the fair market value ofTransamerican's assets which are in excess of one billion dlrs.      Reuter&#3;

The Bass Group, which holds 24.9 pct of Taft, said it hadtalked with other taft stockholders and some company managersand directors "concerning participation in a group to acquirecontrol" of the company.    The Bass group said it had talks with other Taftstockholders and members of Taft management about participatingin a group to acquire control. The group, which is led by thewealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identifyany of the other people with whom it had talks.

Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliateagainst U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce BruceSmart replied, "That would be the height of foolishness."    In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress inmeeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actualimposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17.    Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the UnitedStates last year has come under fire in Congress concernedabout the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with therecord 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986.    President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today fromthe two Democratic leaders of Congress.    "I think it's about time," Senate Democratic Leader RobertByrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wrightof Texas told reporters before the opening of the Housesession, "It just shows we were right all along when we saidsomething needs doing."    Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearingthat last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S.negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts.    Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open upJapan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Lastyear, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with theUnited States in these products.    Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987.    "It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. Ihope it will persuade them we're serious," Smart said of theWhite House trade sanctions.    The United States has tried to convince Japanese carcompanies of the quality of American-made parts and to drawthem away from their traditional Japanese suppliers.    "All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading themwe can do better than our reputation seems to be," he said.    Measured per car, each American-made car contained about700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made carcontained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said. Reuter&#3;

The bill, already passed by the House, would enable 1987winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by Midwestern floodinglast year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal incomesupport payments even if they did not plant.    Amendments considered by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.)would apply the so-called "0/92" option to all 1987 program cropsor, if that failed, to spring wheat, Senate staff said.    Sens. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa)were considering an amendment that would allow feedgrainsproducers to receive final deficiency payments in March insteadof in October.    Earlier this year Dole said advancing the final deficiencypayments would provide feedgrains producers with approximatelythree billion dlrs in income payments prior to spring plantinginstead of in the fall.    Dole and Grassley are also considering an amendment thatwould offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmersfor any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservationreserve program last year.    The bonus payment has been offered to farmers signing upfor the corn program this spring. The U.S. AgricultureDepartment has indicated it would oppose broadening the cornbonus offer.    Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) was said to be contemplatingan amendment that would offer the 0/92 option to spring wheatproducers who were prevented from planting this spring becauseof flooding last year.    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) was eyeing a measure that wouldallow cotton producers to receive disaster aid if the qualityof their crop was hurt by flooding last year.    Democrats and Republicans today were still trying to arriveat an agreement governing time to be devoted to amendments. Reuter&#3;
reut2-011.sgm, FED'S POLICY EASE MAY END WITH 2ND QTR RATE CUT, The Federal Reserve's move to easiermonetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount ratecuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in thesecond quarter, analysts said.    A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates toedge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending ratefrom 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.    "The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further withouta full-blown recession," said Raymond Stone, chief financialeconomist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Stone said economic data available by late June may be justweak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he saidit may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual halfpoint, to avoid hurting the dollar further.    All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open MarketCommittee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.    The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughlyquarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasurybond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at whichbanks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the primelending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.    Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly tothe April-June quarter, follow:    - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct furtheragainst other major currencies because of a large U.S. budgetdeficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted afterthe dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, theeconomists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is thatthe dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.    - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continuetrading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could welltest the lower end of that range.    - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter andprobably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strongforeign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. Theoutlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the yearsince both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.    - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflatorwill rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. Thesharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as willa mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.    - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pctannual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand atrespective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 firstand second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pctannualrate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International seesboth the strongest economy and the highest interest rates amongthose surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pctrate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate thisquarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.    "The economy will bounce back more strongly than manyexpect," Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup ininventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quartereconomic growth, with consumer spending helping later.    "We're running out of special factors to keep the economyafloat," said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. Hisinterest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.    Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulationhelped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that secondquarter growth could be zero or negative.    Braverman said economic activity next quarter will sufferfrom a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow government spending and less construction. Only a marginallynarrower trade deficit will add to growth.    He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct forbonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.    Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildlyafter the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in pastdays and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.    David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Incraised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.    Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, liftedhis forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a pointto eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho andResler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.    The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japaneseinvestors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fearabout further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.trade sanctions.

reut2-011.sgm, EC MINISTERS DIFFER WIDELY ON FARM PRICE PLAN, European Community (EC) agricultureministers gave widely diverging reactions to EC executiveCommission proposals for a radical reduction of guaranteedprices for the EC's 12 mln farmers.    The plans, which could cut the price received by farmers byover 10 pct in many cases, were dismissed by West Germanminister Ignaz Kiechle as in part unacceptable and in part noteven a basis for negotiation, diplomatic sources said.    At the other end of the scale, Britain's Michael Joplingsaid for some products they did not go far enough to reduce themassive spending on the EC's farm policy, the major factorwhich has brought the Community close to a budget crisis.    Ministers discussed the Commission's 1987-88 farm priceproposals for the first time and the sources said negotiationscould last several months yet.    Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker, who is chairing themeeting, told his colleagues he would not even attempt to reachagreement at the current meeting which is due to end Tuesdayalthough prices are supposed to be agreed by April 1.    The disagreement among ministers reflects deep divisionsamong member states about the future of the EC's farm policywhich swallows about two-thirds of the annual 36 billionEuropean Currency Unit (41 billion dollar) budget.    Kiechle, backed generally by his French, Italian andseveral other colleagues, believes sacrifices by traditionalfamily farmers must be kept to a minimum in order to maintainviable rural communities in Europe.    Jopling, with some support from the Netherlands andDenmark, on the whole backs proposals by EC farm commissionerFrans Andriessen to cut guaranteed prices and reduce theopportunities for sales of surplus products into EC stores.    He believes the system which allows such sales nominally asa last resort has become abused, resulting in huge stocks anddamaging trade tensions with other major world food exporters.    Jopling told journalists it was now costing the EC 2,000Ecus a hectare (920 dlrs an acre) to subsidise cottonproduction and double that figure for the growing of certaintypes of tobacco.    Opening yesterday's debate, Andriessen accused officials ofsome EC states of ignoring realities. "They give the impressionof living on another planet where there are no surpluses, nobudgetary deficits and no budgetary discipline for farmspending," he said.    One Andriessen scheme for closing the budget gap couldalready be doomed, diplomats said.    He wants to raise two billion Ecus (2.28 billion dlrs)through a tax on EC produced and imported oilseeds which hasalready raised hackles in Washington because of fears of theimpact on U.S. soybean exports.    Jopling said earlier enough EC states appear opposed tothis scheme to block its adoption provided they all stand firmin the lengthy negotiations ahead on the Commission proposals. Reuter&#3;

"The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessencompetition or to be inconsistent with the public interest," theDOT said in a statement.    AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is aunit of AMR Corp.    The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger planFeb. 20.    American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms ofrevenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively smallcarrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is thenation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would notalter American's third-place ranking, according to datacompiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.    The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.    The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantiallyreduce competition on the four routes on which both carriersprovide either nonstop or single-plane service.    At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOTsaid it found no evidence that other carriers could notincrease or begin service that competed with a mergedAmerican-AirCal.    Concerning the 14th, "While entry may not be possible at theOrange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that theservice provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, willprovide effective competition for Orange County travelers inlong-haul markets," the DOT said.    The merger would give American control of 37 pct of theauthorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange Countyterminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminalbuilding limit future opportunities for expansion.    The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed commentsopposing the merger but "raised no new facts or arguments."

McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that hebelieved synthetic fuels would become economic to develop whenworld oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range.    "You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oilprices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to beprepared," McMillan said.    He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pctannually in the next few years while the nation fails toreplace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn ofthe century, world oil prices will be significantly higherbecause of declining supplies, McMillan said.    Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at themeeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to helpspur development of synthetic fuels.    The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tonsof demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple thatof all the world's known oil reserves.    "We must encourage research now in order to make synfuelscompetitive later," Hall said. The average lead time fordevelopment of a shale oil or liquified coal project is betweenfive and ten years.    Until last year, the federal government had subsidizedsynfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., aresearch program created during the Carter Administration withthe goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrelsof oil.    The corporation was shut down last April when Congressrefused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budgetbecause of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs abarrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face"current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for thepurchase of goods."    The parallel market, although officially tolerated, istechnically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar inthe parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct abovethe official rate.    Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machineryand industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in theparallel market without having to wait for an official orderfrom the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex).    Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in aneffort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviatethe risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of theeconomy.

The vast majority of South Africa's 600,000 miners areblack but whites perform most supervisory jobs.    The government has vowed to open all mining jobs to allraces this year but the mining industry fears clauses insertedin an abolition bill could be used to make it difficult forblacks to qualify for skilled positions.

reut2-011.sgm, CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS, Canada's major banks will likely facestiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performingif, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after theend of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said.    American bankers said last week that slow progress in debttalks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. bankswould soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing.    Such action "would put a lot of pressure on the Canadianbanks to do the same," Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bankanalyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters.    "They (banks) like to appear to be conservative," saidPulcine, "and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performingbasis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lotof pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is consideringthe loans non-performing and another bank is not."    Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said anywillingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp&lt;CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather thanlet Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compellingexample for other creditor banks.    "In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) haveto have the support of the other banks," said Meredith.    Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltdsaid at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify,"wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basisand is trying to encourage the others to take that position."    Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrsby Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments onits 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.    Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 daysbefore declaring loans on which they are receiving no interestas non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days.They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans untillate May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter endingJuly 31.    &lt;Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bankcreditor, said last week it was not currently consideringdeclaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans asnon-performing.    "I think that is just for the benefit of the public," Walshsaid of Bank of Montreal's statement.     Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadianbanks from a move to declare the Brazilian loansnon-performing.    They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments bythe banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banksto recoup their lost interest income.    "From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the bankswill get the money," said Meredith. "My outlook at this point isoptimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year'searnings."    Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of3.80 dlrs for &lt;Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in1986; 4.30 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25dlrs for &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with2.23;  2.15 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94,and 2.85 dlrs for &lt;Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74.    She forecast 1.90 dlrs for &lt;National Bank of Canada>against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.    Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earningsestimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share,assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs.    "If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of thefiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts ashare. But I don't see that as a likely scenario," Pulcine said.    Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that theBrazilian debt situation was so complex that "it could drag onbeyond one full fiscal year."    He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earningsforecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearlyinterest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrsor about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings. Reuter&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, PHILIPPINES TO REPAY SOME PRINCIPAL IN 1987-89, The Philippine government has quietlyagreed to make token payments of principal in each of the nextthree years as part of its 10.3 billion dlr commercial bankdebt rescheduling package finalized last Friday, bankers said.    Manila will pay foreign banks 37 mln dlrs a year in 1987,1988 and 1989, representing four pct of a 925 mln dlr loansigned in 1985. Amortizations on the loan were not due to beginuntil 1990, but the Philippines agreed to make the extra 111mln dlr prepayment in order to win a relatively low interestmargin of 7/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, bankers said.    Bankers said they insisted on the principal repayments sothat they could justify a margin of 7/8 pct by drawing a directparallel between the Philippines and Venezuela, which won a 7/8pct spread on a 21 billion dlr debt rescheduling package lastmonth.    After the Venezuelan deal was clinched, leading New Yorkbankers hurried to argue that 7/8 pct was the new benchmarkspread for a debtor nation that was current on interest, wasnot seeking new money and was amortizing loan principal.    Previously, the 13/16 pct margin granted to Mexico was seenby debtors as the margin to strive for.    The Philippines, which met the first two Venezuelancriteria but not the third, was adamant that it could notaccept a spread higher than 7/8 pct.    Bankers could not back down either because they would havehad to sacrifice millions of dollars in profits and may havethrown the door open to other debtors, notably Argentina andBrazil, to claim even finer spreads than Mexico's.    In the end, the compromise saved face for the banks. "Thebanks were agonizing how to reconcile this package withVenezuela's. This allowed them to walk out and say, We've keptfaith with the Venezuelan precedent," one source said.    The prepayments, although modest, were not apparentlysomething that the Philippine negotiators wanted to dwell uponas they sought to portray their 17-year rescheduling agreementas better than Mexico's.    Finance minister Jaime Ongpin did not refer to theprepayments at a news conference he held in New York on Fridayto announce the rescheduling agreement.    And an accompanying press release referred only obliquelyto the fact that the 7/8 pct margin will increase to one pct"as long as the Philippines pays amortizations as agreed withthe banks."    The threat of a higher margin gives the Philippines everyincentive to make the extra payments, and the government hasindicated that it will in fact do so, bankers said.    Furthermore, by paying back ahead of schedule some of thelast loan it raised, the Philippines will be hoping to make agood impression on the international banking community.    Ongpin said the country should not have a financing gapbefore the end of next year at the earliest, depending on thesuccess of the Philippine Investment Note issues which areplanned, but some bankers say they are already braced for newloan requests for 1988 and 1989.

reut2-011.sgm, U.S. SHOULD REASSESS MIDEAST POLICY - ANALYST, The U.S. should reassessits Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence onimported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center forStrategic and International Studies.     "The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from theGulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commissionreport, mandate more than ever before the need for afundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,"Ebinger said.     He remarks were made in an address to the NationalPetroleum Refiners Association meeting.     "Although in the short run it is difficult to see a directlink between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in thecurrent environment it will be increasingly difficult formoderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S.interests," Ebinger said.     Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crudeoil prices strong recently although some believe prices will beweaker if demand falls in the spring.    But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, saidcrude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.    There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking atthe annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chancethat crude oil prices could move higher in the second half ofthe year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.    He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreementto restrict production.    OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in Junebecause the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  hasdeclined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.    OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollarhas fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.    Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 tofour mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 totwo mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd. Reuter&#3;

"But there has to be a clear indication that they arewilling to act," he said.    Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused bythe U.S. Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar areproblems "they have brought on themselves."    The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.    "Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economicturmoil in Japan," he said. "My only response is that we havegone through about five years with the dollar going in just theopposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it's occurredfor only a few weeks or months in Japan."    The tariffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, willaffect about 300 million dlrs worth of products, only a tinyfraction of Japan's total exports to the U.S.    Even so, Reagan's decision "doesn't give us any joy. Wedon't want to take retaliatory action here if we don't have to,"Yeutter said.

President Ronald Reagan said last week that the U.S. Wouldimpose high tariffs on Japanese imports to retaliate againstalleged Japanese violation of a computer chip trade pact.    The plane, codenamed the FSX, has been the focus ofcompetition between Japanese and U.S. Defence contractors. Atstake is an estimated 6.5 billion dlrs worth of contracts whichthe Japanese government had previously intended to award todomestic firms.    The Ministry has said the plane, part of Japan's selfdefence forces, will be equipped with high technology radardodging equipment, and will be able to fly at very lowaltitudes. It will have a combat radius of 830 kms.    The ministry plans to build 100 FSX fighters to replace all77 of Japan's Mitsubishi-made F-1 planes by the 1990s.

reut2-011.sgm, CHINA GETS RARE CRITICISM DURING PEOPLE'S CONGRESS, Charges of public sector waste,corruption and neglect of agriculture have surfaced amid thecompliments in debates at the annual session of China'sparliament, the National People's Congress (NPC).    China's top entrepreneur Rong Yiren, chairman of the ChinaInternational Investment and Trust Corporation (CITIC), whoalso represents Shanghai in the NPC, attacked the "profit beforeeverything" mentality which he said led to theft, embezzlementand extravagant gifts and banquets.    Public criticism of policy is rare in China.    The New China News Agency quoted comments by NPC members onPremier Zhao Ziyang's draft work program for the year ahead.    The rural lobby was active. Deputies from three provincessaid Zhao was not forceful enough in tackling their problems.One said the state had cut spending on agriculture from 11 pctof total capital investment in 1979 to three or four pct today."This is incompatible with the important place occupied byagriculture," he said.    Other deputies said the state had broken promises toimprove fertiliser, oil and seed supplies to their provinces.    Although another congress member was quoted by the agencyas saying Zhao's opening speech last week was "discreet,appropriate, comprehensive and assuring," others said thegovernment had spent too much or too little.    One member, described as a person with no partyaffiliation, said people were worried about the state's budgetdeficit, projected to reach more than two billion dlrs thisyear.    "The deficit is due not only to the sharp drop in oil price,but also to lavishness and waste of funds, which should bestopped," he said.    "The National People's Congress used to be a rubber stamp,but now it is a little bit more than that," said a westerndiplomat, referring to the range of debate.    Another western diplomat said the Communist Party hadgranted a slightly greater role to the Congress in the last twoor three years and some of its members were testing out theirinfluence.    The committee's decision to strike from the agenda acontroversial plan to give greater power to management of stateenterprises and less to local party committees caused raisedeyebrows, the diplomat added.    One diplomat said Zhao's keynote speech could emerge inslightly amended form at the end of the 2-1/2 week session inthe Great Hall of the People.    She said there had been similar changes one year ago, whenthe Congress added words about the importance of ideologicaleducation and the need to help poorer provinces left behind inChina's uneven march to greater prosperity.

reut2-011.sgm, TRADE FRICTION THREATENS TO TOPPLE NAKASONE, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may havebeen dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapidrise and the threat of a trade war with the United States,political analysts said.    Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reformplan, may now be forced to resign before the June economicsummit of seven industrialised nations if local elections laternext month go against candidates from his ruling LiberalDemocratic Party (LDP), they said.    "The close relationship between Nakasone and PresidentReagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base,"Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchidatold Reuters. "So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damagesNakasone."    Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone wasencountering criticism not only from opposition parties butalso within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax.    "Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves fromNakasone," Uchida said. "His position within the LDP itself isnot so strongly established today."    Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general publicthan with many LDP members, is now seeing his public supporteroded, the analysts said.    The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat onFriday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods inretaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip tradepact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, theanalysts said.    "Apparently the special relationship between Reagan andNakasone hasn't worked effectively," Rei Shiratori, director ofthe Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said.    This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone'scredibility, Shiratori told Reuters.    The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen'srise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP lossesin the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said.    "If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have toresign early," Shiratori said.    But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempersbefore or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29,some analysts said.    However, "unless the Japanese political system can move morequickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take toWashington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a veryhostile audience," said Merrill Lynch Securities economistWilliam Sterling.    "If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put thefinal nail in his coffin," he said.    Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growingRepublican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argueagainst a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analystssaid.    But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupledwith uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors toNakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over thedifferences and aid Nakasone, they said.    "One factor against a trade war may be that Washington isnot anxious to push Nakasone into his grave," Sterling said. REUTER&#3;

The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a jointstatement.    The previously announced float of part of its Delhiinterest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.    Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, whichholds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-ledCooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.    In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equallyin any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensateprices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi'sinterests in the next two years, the statement said.    "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest willbe more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with thefloat," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.    Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focusefforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and buildingmaterials in which CSR has had long and successful managementexperience and strong market leadership.    With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businessesmore aggressively and earlier, he said.    As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhisale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;PioneerSugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing itsentire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.    After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin isAustralia's largest oil and gas producing area with currentgross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gasliquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubicfeet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said.    The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The BrokenHill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshoreproduction in Australia, they said.    Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assistin maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in theCooper-Eromanga area.    "These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency inoil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in BassStrait production now under way," McGill said.    In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelmansaid CSR was within days of completing plans for the float ofCSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso.    He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decisionin view of the risks associated with the oil business.    The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to shareequally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average morethan 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said.    Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi tonet realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date,will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs.    However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assetswill significantly reduce this loss, he said.    He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by futureprospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in corebusinesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payablein July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 centsagainst 18 in 1985/86.

reut2-011.sgm, CHINA RURAL INDUSTRY FACES PROBLEMS IN ADVANCING, Workers in China's ruralfactories are struggling against a variety of problems tomaintain the momentum of progress since industrialisation ofthe countryside began in the 1970s.    "When I was a child, we had no bicycles. We went everywhereon foot. The land here is salty, so the harvests were not good.Money and food were inadequate. When it rained, the waterleaked through the grass roof," said Li Wenxian, 31, of Hongshanin Zhejiang. Now he and other villagers live in largetwo-storey concrete homes with balconies and courtyards.    But still they face formidable difficulties. Many ruralfactories are unable to get the raw materials they need, orelse they find they have become too expensive.    Gao Jianming, an official of Zhejiang's Rural Industrydepartment, said Zhejiang firms scour China for raw materials,which sometimes they barter for finished goods.    The People's Daily this month reported about 60 pct ofChina's rural factories operate below capacity because of powershortages. It said many rural factories lose money because ofthese problems and difficulties in getting credit, poor qualityof goods and competition from larger state firms.    "Electricity is short. In the busiest periods on the farmsthe factories work three to four days a week so thatagriculture can have all the power it needs. But more power isavailable at night or on Sundays," Gao said.    Rural factories mostly operate outside official plans,which allocate raw materials under quota at cheap prices tostate firms. They have to compete on the open market for rawmaterials whose prices are driven up by demand.    Li said Hongshan does not suffer from power shortages onlybecause its cement factory provides cheap cement to theelectricity supply department.    The raw materials of Hongshan's cement have to comehundreds of miles from central China by rail or canal, whileits textile factories buy fabric from the far northeast.    The industrialisation of rural China began in the late1970s, a key part of top leader Deng Xiaoping's economicreforms. Deng wanted to harness the manpower of thecountryside, but keep it there and not draw it to the cities.    Hongshan set up factories and businesses because there wasnot enough work on the land for its 3,700 people. Now just 120of its workers work full-time on the land. The rest work in 23factories making cement, plastics and textiles.    The transformation of the rural economy is most noticeablealong the eastern seaboard where communications are good,labour plentiful, land fertile and large markets nearby.    Gao said rural factories in Zhejiang now employ 25 pct ofthe province's labour force. In 1985 such factories, for thefirst time, produced more in value than the province's farms.    "The industrialising process is not over. When our farms aremore mechanised, and not many are now, more labour will becomeavailable. There is a very big potential," Gao said.    Rural industry in Zhejiang has grown by more than 20 pct ayear since 1980, faster than any other sector of the economy.    Goods from Hongshan's factories are sold all over China.    Villager Li said when Hongshan started building factoriesin 1975 it was illegal, but local leaders approved it oncondition no state money was invested.    "We borrowed money to start our cement factory and haverelied on our own resources since then," he said.    Another worker in a Hongshan tea-growing collective saidbefore rural industrialisation there was no point in workinghard, because most people earned the same.    "The laziest in the commune used to laugh at those of us whoworked more, but got the same," she said. REUTER&#3;

He said India had agreed to export to Japan about 23 mlntonnes of iron ore in 1987/88, about the same as in the currentyear.    The official described the agreement as satisfactoryoverall. He said it was signed by an official Indian tradedelegation and Japanese businessmen in Tokyo last week.    The official said it was encouraging that Japan had agreednot to reduce ore imports from India although Japan's totaliron ore imports would be lower in the coming year because ofthe recession in the Japanese steel industry.    He said Japanese ore imports in calendar 1987 would total96 mln tonnes, compared with 103.5 mln in 1986.    Government officials said India's total ore exports arelikely to rise to between 33 and 34 mln tonnes in 1987/88,against a provisionally estimated 31 mln in 1986/87. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, PHILIPPINES CONFIRMS PREPAYMENTS ON NEW DEBT PACT, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin hasconfirmed the Philippines agreed to make token prepayments ofprincipal to foreign banks as part of a 10.3 billion dlr debtrestructuring package.    A Reuters report from New York yesterday quoted bankers assaying Manila will pay 111 mln dlrs over 1987, 1988 and 1989.    But Ogpin denied Manila was playing down the prepaymentaspect of the restructuring.    "They are public documents and there is nothing secret aboutit," he told Reuters.    The debt accord, announced last Friday, stretchedrepayments of 10.3 billion dlrs over a 17-year period with aseven and a half year grace period and an interest rate marginof 7/8 percentage points over Eurodollar rates.    Ongpin said the prepayments were part of "seven differentscenarios" Philippine negotiators prepared before the talks.    "It was one of the many options we offered the banks inorder to win an attractive pricing," he said.    The prepayments were on a 925 mln dlr nine-year loan signedin 1985, which carried a four-year grace period. Principalrepayments were not due until 1990.    Ongpin said the prepayments would hardly affect thePhilippines' balance of payments position.    "There is no problem in financing it -- the prepaymentsconstitute about 1.5 pct of current international reserves of2.5 billion dlrs," he said.    "We do plan to cover the costs by selling PhilippineInvestment Notes (PINs) worth about 150 mln dlrs a year."    PINs are negotiable, foreign-currency denominatedinstruments that will be offered to creditor banks and aredesigned for conversion into pesos to fund government-approvedequity investments within the Philippines.    Ongpin said Manila would have to repay about 200 mln dlrs ayear when amortisations on the 925 mln dlr loan came up.    He said the 12-bank advisory committee sent telexes of theaccord to the country's 483 creditor banks and he expecteddocumentation and agreement from all of them by July.    Foreign bankers here said the pact gave Manila the largestinterest rate cut among major debtor nations.    They said Mexico's new debt package last October marked a1/16 point drop from its 1985 debt agreement, while Manila'snew pact slashed its 1985 agreement by up to 3/4 percentagepoints.    Venezuela's new margin last month was only a 1/4 point dropfrom the rate agreed in a rescheduling accord in 1986, thebankers said.    "Add to this the fact that Manila has frozen principalrepayents since 1983, while Venezuela has amortised six billiondlrs in foreign debt since 1984 and will have paid back morethan eight billion dlrs by the end of this year," one added.    Ongpin said Manila's 7/8 margin meant the Philippines wouldpay about 100 mln dlrs a year in interest when its grace periodended. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, JAPANESE HESITATE TO INVEST IN WEST GERMAN STOCKS, Japanese investors are reluctant to buyWest German stocks, now considered one of the most attractivebuys around after having taken a beating for the past twoyears, investment managers said.    Although the Frankfurt stock market is one of the world'slargest in capitalisation, wealthy Japanese institutions viewit as too small. They also worry about venturing into a marketfrom which British investors have recently bailed out, theysaid.    "There's not enough turnover there to absorb the amount ofbuying Japanese want to do," one West German investment managersaid. There is a danger Japanese institutions may be unable toliquidate their holdings quickly if the market takes a suddendownturn, he added.    "Japanese familiarity with West German stocks is alsolimited," another investment manager said. "They know the bluechips, but there are too many other names they don't know."    The recent rapid advance of the Tokyo stock market has alsodeterred Japanese from wandering off to markets abroad,investment managers said.    Japanese fund managers are afraid of criticism if they buyinto unsure overseas markets while the market at home continuesto advance, said Seiji Yamamoto, senior manager at Dresdner ABDSecurities Ltd's Tokyo branch.    If gains from investments abroad lag behind those possiblefrom the Tokyo market, they could face difficulty explainingtheir funds' performance, he added.    The Frankfurt market's 15 pct depreciation just since thebeginning of this year has also been causing Japanese investorsto turn away, one investment manager said.    The Frankfurt slump stems from expectations of slowcorporate growth due to the mark's strength against the dollarand a withdrawal of funds by British institutions just beforethe London market's liberalisation last year, the investmentmanager said. "Right now Japanese investors are taking await-and-see attitude while the condition of the market remainsunfavourable," he said.    Although there has been some nibbling of West Germanstocks, particularly last week, most of the buys were forshort-term trades rather than long-term investments, aninvestment advisor at a West German firm said.    Investment managers believe, however, that genuine interestin West German stocks could develop within the next three tosix months.    Japanese fund managers still favour the New York and theLondon markets over the Frankfurt market but they areinterested in diversifying some of their funds, they said.    Some managers have been travelling in Europe, looking fornew opportunities, and are unlikely to ignore West Germanstocks, especially with the average price/earnings ratio atabout 11, they said.    The Frankfurt ratio compares with about 16 for the U.S. AndLondon markets and 52 for the Japanese market, GuenterKirchhain, first vice president for Deutsche Bank AG said.    "This mismatching will sooner or later generate an enormousalignment potential," he said. The West German market couldreasonably have an average price/earnings ratio of around 16,he added.    Japanese investment plans may soon become clearer as manyinstitutions begin their new business years in April, he said.    However, one fund manager does not agree that newinvestment in West Germany will come that soon.    "Japanese do not buy into a market with decliningfundamentals," he said. When West Germany's fundamental economicindicators appear to have bottomed out, that will be theturning point for their investments, he added.    Another manager said the Japanese are waiting to see theinvestment trends set by U.S. And British investors in the WestGerman market.    "They are waiting for someone to make the first move," hesaid.

reut2-011.sgm,  EUROPE ON SIDELINES IN U.S-JAPAN MICROCHIP ROW, Rising imports of Japanese-made cars andelectronic goods may upset West European officials, but theygenerally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latesttrade row between the United States and Japan.    Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair tradepractices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.    The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficitwith Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanesetrade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.    But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of actingwith the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus.    "The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is theU.S.," said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade PolicyResearch Centre in London. "Basically, their policies are prettymuch the same."    But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Orthat the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage ofthe U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.    "In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here," headded. "In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic offree competition, while in Europe, the general approach is thatliberal trade is good because it makes countries rich."    Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington'stendency to impose so-called "countervailing duties" - an importtax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.    In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends tobe to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.    In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan hasthreatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronicgoods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan hasfailed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.    But the European Community has challenged the agreement asa violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.    "It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side ofthe United States in defence of the agreement," said Wolf.    Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a toughline on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the restof Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC takethe lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels toldReuters there has been no change in the Community's positionsince a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent astrong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.    In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreignministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance andappealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said afterthe talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.    Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw nosigns of any immediate intention to impose any broad-rangingsanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking atrade war, they said.    Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas inEuropean trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking totry to improve the situation, the diplomats said.    In Britain, where the government is angered over thedifficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless hasfaced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials saidlast week that retaliatory action is being considered.    But government officials said last night, "We are nottalking about days or weeks. This is going to take time."    They said the government would consider its options at acabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisionswere expected. The main thing the British would threaten theJapan with is denial of access to London's booming financialmarkets, government officials said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, BANK OF JAPAN MULLS OTHER OPTIONS TO STOP YEN RISE, Today's liberalised financial markets aremaking it extremely difficult for Japan's monetary authoritiesto prevent the yen's rise against the dollar, but they haveseveral options other than normal intervention, Bank of Japansources said.    A senior central bank official said that such methods ascontrolling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swapagreements with other central banks, which have not beeninvoked since 1978, are all being considered.    "But the time may not be ripe," he said.    "In this era of financial liberalisation, it's almostimpossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,"said another senior bank official.    But the first official said: "From a technical viewpoint,the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediatelyafter other central banks involved agreed to do so."    A swap agreement, an exchange of currency between twonations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of theother's currency in case of need.    "If the Bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announcethe decision jointly," said the first official.    The sources said they believed the limit of currency marketintervention may be being reached after they saw recentconcerted market action by central banks of major industrialnations was increasingly ineffective in propping up thebattered dollar.    But intervention is at least an option, they said. Furthereasing of monetary policy will be very difficult with anofficial discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, theysaid.    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruledout another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation.    One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty ofthe Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with theU.S. And other central banks, if these banks continueintervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and runout of their yen cash positions.    "But we don't think they have become short of yen quite yet,"he said.    The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit withthe U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks,according to the sources.    Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold twobillion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support thedollar in New York last week.    The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange othercurrency swap agreements with Britain and France if they findit necessary, but added they are not actually talking with eachother towards that end.

reut2-011.sgm, CHINA REFORMS TO TAKE DECADES, NO ALTERNATIVE, China's economic reforms will takedecades to fulfill and will outlast the life of any leaderbecause they are the only way to save the country from poverty,an economist in one of the country's top think tanks toldReuters.    But He Weiling, Washington representative of the ChinaEconomic System Reform Institute, said China's economic reformsdefinitely are not at risk from the nationwide drive sinceJanuary against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase meaning Westernpolitical ideas.    He said "bourgeois liberalism" is not affecting departmentsdealing with economics.    His is one of a small number of key institutes, set up inthe early 1980s, which formulate economic reform policies andadvise the top leadership on them.    Discussing subjects raised in the budget speech last week,which put the 1986 and 1987 deficits at more than 15 billionyuan because of excessive consumer demand and capitalconstruction plus falling efficiency in state firms, He saidreform of state firms and the financial system is the key goalfor 1987.    "The most difficult thing is to strike the balance betweenmaking them independent units and the need for central control,"He said.    "We are exploring ways of doing this, through joint stockownership, leasing, factory management responsibility systemsor in other ways," he added.    One of the most serious problems facing China's leaders ishow to curb excess investment in capital construction,especially in projects outside the state plan.    He said this problem is chronic in all socialist economies.    This is because firms are judged on output, notprofitability or efficiency.    "Firms use every excuse to get money and materials. They saythey want money to build offices but in fact use it to buildapartments, which is unauthorised," He said.    "Also, it is not good to report profits, which would meanhigher tax payments. It is better to report a loss," he added.    He said China's state firms are continuing a 5,000-year-oldtradition when they under-report their assets in order toreduce claims on them by higher authority.    He said China will have to improve auditing, economicregulations and the tax system, which he described as "chaotic,"especially at the lower levels, in order to deal withunder-reporting.    "Another important step is to further develop the moneymarkets to give firms an opportunity to invest. They needchannels for this which they do not have now. Without this,there will be no genuine supply and demand for money," he said.    As a reform to encourage efficiency, China now suppliesstate firms with loans instead of grants as in the past.    But He said the reforms have not resulted in much realchange because the loans carry low-interest. "So some efficientfirms have not been able to get money from banks."    Price reform has been one of the most sensitive aspects ofthe reform programme. Widespread discontent over price risesforced the government to promise in January that there will beno major increases in 1987.    He said the price of steel, timber and cement and otherindustrial raw materials only will "rise gradually" this year.    Large-scale price adjustments would have an adversepsychological impact and create social discontent.    "We must preserve unity and popular support," he said, but"sometimes, the common people must make a sacrifice, like thoseof Germany and Japan after 1945."    He said restrictions on a wide range of prices, includingmost farm and light industrial products, have been lifted andmany intermediate pricing schemes scrapped over the last eightyears.    "It will take at least 15 to 20 years to complete anoverhaul of the price system. We must move carefully. We haveno model to work from and have only ourselves to rely on," Hesaid.    He said the greatest fear expressed by foreigners is thatreform and open-door policies will not survive the death ofcertain elderly leaders.    He did not name top leader Deng Xiaoping, 82, the chiefarchitect of both policies since 1979.    "These fears are unfounded. The two policies have alreadybecome the basic national policy of China. The reforms areirreversible. China is one of the poorest 25 countries in theworld. Without the reforms, how are we to escape from thispoverty?" REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, ANALYSTS APPLAUD CSR'S BOLD MOVE TO SELL DELHI, CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> has made a bold move inselling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs andploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, shareanalysts said.    "It sounds like a good deal," Stuart McKibbin of &lt;A.C. Goodeand Co> told Reuters.    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gasinterests held in the &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> and would insteadsell it to Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit &lt;Esso Exploration andProduction Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs.    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largestsugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct itdoes not already hold in &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.    "This will be a big shock to the market, which was under theimpression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,"McKibbin said.    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had givenitself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark onan ambitious expansion programme in its best-performingdivisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.    CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the rightto share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from anoil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.    Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producersyielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin.Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrsfor every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.    Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker &lt;Bain and Co Ltd>said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industrywas a sensible one but added that it represented the loss ofAustralian-owned assets to a foreign company.    "The farm they bought back a few years ago is being soldback to the Americans," Goldston-Morris said.    The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far thelargest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industryand would give it access to some of the best sugar propertiesand mills in the country, analysts said.    They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommendacceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from thebottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.    Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne nextseason from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.    Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaginginvestment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company'soverall performance, analysts said.    CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses onwhat had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirelyfrom U.S. Dollar debt, they said.    "It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirelywith debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oilprice collapsed on them," Owen Evans of Sydney broker &lt;Mearesand Philips Ltd> said.    Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but alsogained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax lossesaccumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.    Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stakein Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd&lt;BRKN.S>.    "Esso has been very keen to diversify from the GippslandBasin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait latelyand Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,"Goldston-Morris said.

reut2-011.sgm, TAIWAN BANKERS PREDICT MAJOR FINANCIAL REFORM, Taiwan is planning to significantlyrelax foreign exchange controls within the next few months, butthere is little prospect of a sudden outflow of capital,bankers and economists polled by Reuters said.    They said a statement by Premier Yu Kuo-Hua last Fridaythat Taiwan might suspend the controls indicated the governmentwas ready to allow Taiwanese firms and individuals to hold andinvest foreign currency for the first time.    "There has been a major shift in government policy," saidLiang Kuo-Shu, chairman of the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank.    Yu said foreign exchange controls, under which all foreigncurrency must be converted into Taiwan dollars, might besuspended if Taiwan's trade surplus grows too large. He saidcontrols could be retained for use in an emergency.    Yu said the aim was to reduce Taiwan's foreign exchangereserves and ease pressure on the money supply.    The reserves have grown to a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs,compared with about 26 billion in late March last year, due toTaiwan's widening trade surplus. The surplus hit a record 15.6billion dlrs last year against 10.6 billion in 1985.    Approximately 95 pct of the surplus was with the U.S.    The surplus in the first two months of this year rose to2.73 billion dlrs from 2.02 billion in the same 1986 period.    Money supply grew by a seasonally adjusted 48.22 pct in theyear to end-february.    Bankers and economists said they did not believe thegovernment intended to drop all foreign exchange controls andallow the Taiwan dollar to be freely traded.    But they said over the next few months certain restrictionswill probably be eased to allow Taiwanese firms and individualsto hold part of their foreign exchange earnings for overseasinvestment.    Bankers and economists also said it was likely thegovernment would lift a ban on investment in foreign stocks.They said it was uncertain, however, whether investment wouldbe direct or channeled through government-approved funds.    Taiwan allowed firms and individuals to invest in overseasgovernment bonds, treasury bills and certificates of depositfor the first time last year.    Bankers said Yu's statment was an indication the governmentis becoming increasingly concerned about the threat ofinflation posed by the growing foreign exchange reserves.    Inflation is now running at about three pct.    Mounting reserves are also seen as giving Washingtonleverage in its efforts to force Taiwan to boost the value ofits currency to reduce the trade imbalance.    Bankers said dropping foreign exchange restrictions wasunlikely to lead to significant capital outflows because of therising value of the Taiwan dollar.    "All the signs are that capital would move in," said JohnBrinsden, manager of Standard Chartered Bank in Taipei.    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 16 pct against theU.S. Dollar since September 1985. It opened today at 34.26against the American currency.    Most economists believe the Taiwan dollar will continue torise this year on strong U.S. Pressure for appreciation.    Economists estimate up to five billion U.S. Dlrs ofspeculative money flowed into Taiwan last year.    Yu's statement surprised most local and foreign bankers,who regard the former central bank governor as a fiscalarch-conservative. They said it shows Taiwan is determined togo ahead with wide-ranging financial liberalisation.    "It's more than a straw in the wind," said Brinsden. "Itindicates that something dramatic will happen." REUTER&#3;
reut2-011.sgm, BROKERS SAY TOKYO STOCKS WILL RESUME RISE, The Tokyo stock market is likely torecover from its recent nervousness, caused by the rise of theyen and the threat of a trade war with the U.S., And resume itsupward climb, brokers polled by Reuters said.    President Reagan's threat to impose tariffs on Japaneseelectronics exports because of Japan's alleged refusal to abideby a bilateral agreement on computer chips, was unlikely tocause the market to crash, the brokers said on the eve of thenew fiscal year starting April 1.    The market today fell 60.91 points to 21,566.66.    Most brokers said Tokyo stocks should rise 10 to 15 pct inthe coming fiscal year, provided the yen does not rise too faragainst the dollar and U.S. Sanctions do not escalate into anall-out trade war.    "The market will continue to rise in the new fiscal year, solong as we can avoid a free-fall in the dollar against the yen,"Nikko Securities' top analyst Kasuhiza Okamoto said.    However, brokers said the market was unlikely to performbetter than it has in the past year.    "It will be very difficult to repeat last year'sperformance. Last year was a bumper year that will live in theannals of the market," said Kleinwort and Benson Ltd'ssecurities analyst, Peter Tasker.    The market rose 37 pct in the fiscal year just ending.    Tasker said Japan's discount rate, which was cut five timesthis past fiscal year, was so low that it forced funds frombank accounts into stocks, buoying the market.    Nomura Securities Company brokers said that in the comingyear the discount rate would probably be cut only once or twiceand the inflow of funds would be slower.    Brokers said their optimism about the market was based onthe current low interest rates, the increasing propensity ofthe Japanese to save as the economy stagnates, the imminentintroduction of taxes on traditionally untaxed post officesavings and the allure of quick and easy profits from stocks.    They said Japanese with money to spare, and companiesunwilling to invest in real plant and machinery in the presentclimate of stagnant growth, would keep on snapping up stocks.    "You just have to jump on the back of the winners and jumpoff quick if they start to lose," one broker said.    Currently the Japanese discount rate is 2.5 pct.    Brokers predicted that among this year's winners would beshares which will benefit from domestic expansion.    Other winners would be stocks related to the fight againstAIDS, financial stocks in general, food shares likely to gainfrom a government-initiated agricultural deregulationprogramme, and issues supported by Japan's increased defensespending budget.    "The themes this year are very clear," said Nikko Securities'Okamoto. He said Japan had to respond to international pressureto stimulate its domestic demand, buy more imports andestablish itself as a supply base of capital.    Brokers said banks and other financial institutions wouldbe among the most popular shares this year.    "We will have to consolidate our position as the capitalsupply base to the world," said Okamoto, noting Japan is theworld's largest creditor nation.    Brokers said they expect the government this year to permitJapanese banks to start full-scale equity brokerage overseas.They also expect it to relax financial practice laws in Japan.    Brokers said they expect subsidies to Japan's farmers to beslashed this year, cutting the price of food. Beneficiaries ofsuch a move would include food processors and suppliers.    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has set the expansion ofdomestic demand as a top priority this year, and brokers saidthey envisaged higher profits for real estate and constructioncompanies, as well as many domestic manufacturers.    Brokers denied a suggestion that the market might beover-extended because the amount now invested, 334,000 billionyen, was about the same as Japan's gross national product.    Barclays De Zoette and Wedd financial analyst, PeterMorgan, said the 20 pct tax on post office and bank depositsdue to be levied this autumn would channel at least 2,000billion more yen into the stock market.    Brokers said they believe there would be more reports inthe coming year of scientific discoveries to combat or diagnoseAquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and these wouldpropel related companies' shares even higher than they hadrisen already.    "AIDS stories suck individuals' money into the market.Japanese people are paranoid about AIDS," said one broker. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET, Consuming countries, chastened by thecollapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price supportoperations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before thatcommodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they areserving, a Reuter survey showed.    They want price ranges to be more responsive to markettrends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining theaccords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoidthe risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses,have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.    Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned ageneralised approach to commodity price stabilisation andprefer to assess each commodity case by case, the surveyshowed.    The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week setprecise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could dounder the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchaselimits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures marketsand stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct oftotal buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. Thiswill help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, theworld's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the BufferStock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) wasadopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exportingcountries agreed several changes to make the reference pricemore responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisionsunder which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to financeoperations. Direct cash contributions from members will fundbuffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular featureof the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses runninginto hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiationsin London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist thatagreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that"objective criteria" should be used to define export quotashares, which would have meant a reduction in the share ofBrazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintainits previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,delegates and trade sources see chances of any near termnegotiations on export quota distribution as remote.    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. Thesedo not have any economic clauses but provide a forum fordiscussions on possible future economic agreements, collectstatistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts saiddifferences between sugar exporting countries have held up anyprogress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheercompetition between major exporters amid a world grain glutmilitate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.    An alternative focus for commodity discussions areinternational study groups, made up of governments with advicefrom industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planneddirectly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed tobecome operational because neither the U.S. Nor the SovietUnion has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said theU.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,citing the lack of widespread support.    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials inKuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commoditypact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing tostudy individual cases for economically sound, market-orientedcommodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.    "We see little to be gained by attempting to increase theprice of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,"official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currentlybelongs to only two international commodity agreements thathave economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheatpacts.    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreementbecause it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic andnot designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRAas the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other membersof the pact to agree that the price review and adjustmentmechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflectmarket trends and also to continue the accord as a marketoriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they haveconsistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts onthe merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries MinisterLim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, theworld's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides itsparticipation in international commodity pacts case by case.    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin ProducingCountries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPClaunched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnesfor a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from70,000.    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture anddelegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron toldReuters in London, "Agreements with economic clauses tostabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges wereclose to market reality, if there was full participation byproducers and consumers, and if participants were prepared totake their obligations in the framework of the agreementseriously."    But Baron added, "No real sanctions are available for acountry that doesn't stick to its obligations...The Germanapproach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the bestinstrument to help developing countries. They were never meantto be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is howdeveloping countries often interpret them."    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive ofcommodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with ThirdWorld producing countries. But recently demands for morestringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on theneed for "intellectual honesty" and "objective criteria" havegrown.    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to bea two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving directmarket participation through a buffer stock have a high degreeof transparency and do not contain the risk of open-endedborrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices toreflect changes in market structure and price trends ratherthan dictate what prices should be.    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges pricerealism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourableto commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer ofsugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the realmarket situation, particularly regarding stocks.    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja toldReuters in Jakarta: "These agreements can work as long as theproblems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there arestructural problems..But we are still committed to commodityagreements as an act of faith." Nicaraguan External TradeMinister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producerscannot afford not to give their backing to commodityagreements.    "The political will is not there on the part of someconsumers to make agreements work," Martinez Cuenca said.    The head of the economics department in the BrazilianForeign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters anagreement can be successful if it keeps a link with marketreality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a systemof quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pactand actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman GrahamShanley said consuming countries realise steady export earningsenhance developing countries' ability to service debt and meangreater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.

reut2-011.sgm, JAPAN TO CUT MICROCHIP OUTPUT, BOOST IMPORTS, Leading domestic semiconductor makerswill boost imports and cut production of key memory microchipsfrom next month in line with government attempts to ward offU.S. Trade sanctions, company spokesmen said.    The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off thesanctions, despite obstacles to full implementation of theplans, analysts said.    The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth ofproducts and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure tohonour a semiconductor trade pact.    In announcing the sanctions last Friday, President Reagansaid Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatorypricing and open Japan's market to foreign products.    But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter saidyesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to dropthe tariffs if Japan shows a "clear indication" that it will openits markets to U.S. Goods.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) hasurged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in thesecond quarter, following a call to reduce production by morethan 20 pct the previous quarter.    MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports.    Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington tocancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan.    "The U.S. Wants to be satisfied. It has rattled its swordand shown that it can and will do business," said analyst NickEdwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo.    But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers cancut output, boosting imports -- the key to U.S. Withdrawal ofthe sanctions -- is more difficult.    "The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC's(integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumerproducts. They're well supplied here," said Richard May, senioranalyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo.    The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's,but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-endproduction skills, the analysts said.    "The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses onsemiconductors in return for free access to other areas," saidEdwards.    A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T>, said the firm'sreduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory(256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off thetrade sanctions. Decreased production was a natural result ofthe company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's, he said.    Company officials unveiled the following plans -    - NEC Corp &lt;NESI.T>, Japan's largest chipmaker, plans toslash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct tosix mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln lastquarter.     In the year beginning April 1, NEC will boost chipimports, which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chipconsumption the year before.    - Hitachi Ltd's &lt;HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM's willfall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March. Thecompany is trying to boost imports but has not set a specifictarget. Imports are currently very low.    - Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAMproduction by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and isconsidering ways to boost imports, a company official said.    Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sellthe U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning ajoint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northernJapan.    - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim secondquarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mlnchips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increasedimports but an official said "boosting imports will be difficultas it depends on sales demand."    - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord withMITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.    - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce Aprilproduction by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln. Oki is studying waysto increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginningApril 1 from the previous year's total of more than fivebillion yen, a company official said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS, One or two large West German bankseffectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity atthe end of the month in order to achieve higher rates fromtheir overnight deposits, money dealers said.    As a result, call money soared in active trading to aroundthe Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday asbanks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.    Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at thecentral bank over the first 29 days of the month.    Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.    To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raiseholdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today andtomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business becausebanks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale ofTreasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct forthree-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.    Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not returnuntil tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.    Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,commanded short-term money requirements of as much as fivebillion marks or so.    With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of themonth, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,draining liquidity for three days. When other banks soughtfunds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excessfunds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.    One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advancedknowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed itssales of treasury bills on Friday.    Though dealers only late in the day learn of the totalminimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbankhas an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipatethe strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.    "(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are notselling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in thisamount," he said. "If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer themarket then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it willbe different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so."    But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump inrates, given the delicate state of currency markets.    International central banks have been at pains to prevent adollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmerundertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.    "The whole tender policy is to have a call money of betweenthree and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have todaycannot be very popular," the senior dealer said.    Dealers said the large banks probably achieved averagerates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct orfour pct. This is a higher return than they would have earnedwithout the excessive draining through the treasury billmechanism.    Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiationsbetween Germany's major employers and the unions, theBundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes tomonetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.    Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on theLombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billionmarks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, PHILIPPINES CONFIRMS PREPAYMENTS ON NEW DEBT PACT, Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin hasconfirmed the Philippines agreed to make token prepayments ofprincipal to foreign banks as part of a 10.3 billion dlr debtrestructuring package.    A Reuters report from New York yesterday quoted bankers assaying Manila will pay 111 mln dlrs over 1987, 1988 and 1989.    But Ogpin denied Manila was playing down the prepaymentaspect of the restructuring.    "They are public documents and there is nothing secret aboutit," he told Reuters.    The debt accord, announced last Friday, stretchedrepayments of 10.3 billion dlrs over a 17-year period with aseven and a half year grace period and an interest rate marginof 7/8 percentage points over Eurodollar rates.    Ongpin said the prepayments were part of "seven differentscenarios" Philippine negotiators prepared before the talks.    "It was one of the many options we offered the banks inorder to win an attractive pricing," he said.    The prepayments were on a 925 mln dlr nine-year loan signedin 1985, which carried a four-year grace period. Principalrepayments were not due until 1990.    Ongpin said the prepayments would hardly affect thePhilippines' balance of payments position.    "There is no problem in financing it -- the prepaymentsconstitute about 1.5 pct of current international reserves of2.5 billion dlrs," he said.    "We do plan to cover the costs by selling PhilippineInvestment Notes (PINs) worth about 150 mln dlrs a year."    PINs are negotiable, foreign-currency denominatedinstruments that will be offered to creditor banks and aredesigned for conversion into pesos to fund government-approvedequity investments within the Philippines.    Ongpin said Manila would have to repay about 200 mln dlrs ayear when amortisations on the 925 mln dlr loan came up.    He said the 12-bank advisory committee sent telexes of theaccord to the country's 483 creditor banks and he expecteddocumentation and agreement from all of them by July.    Foreign bankers here said the pact gave Manila the largestinterest rate cut among major debtor nations.    They said Mexico's new debt package last October marked a1/16 point drop from its 1985 debt agreement, while Manila'snew pact slashed its 1985 agreement by up to 3/4 percentagepoints.    Venezuela's new margin last month was only a 1/4 point dropfrom the rate agreed in a rescheduling accord in 1986, thebankers said.

Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn inforeign business because of lower energy prices and the highermark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customernations.    Domestic business was also declining and orders for WestGerman engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,Dieter said.    Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.    Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer aset- back, although measures to cut costs, which were startedlast year, were now having an effect.    Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related productsaccounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. Thecompany saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dietersaid had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims."    He said the company's drive to combine activities inmechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "pluspoint" for Mannesmann.    Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to takea majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts groupfor an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fallnine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group netprofit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.    It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollarand lack of demand for steel pipe.    Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipewere bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he addedthe company would continue to cut personnel in this sector thisyear. REUTER&#3;

The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today.    "Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economicturmoil in Japan," he said. "My only response is that we havegone through about five years with the dollar going in just theopposite direction.

reut2-011.sgm, ALUMINIUM CAPACITY GROWTH TREND SEEN INSUFFICIENT, Aluminium capacity expansion planned forthe period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply anyacceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on thescale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony BirdAssociates' 1987 Aluminium Review.    By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need tobe around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mlntonnes are scheduled, Bird said.    Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 andincreased imports by less developed countries.    Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerateby as much as general growth, but non-socialist worldconsumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Birdsaid.    Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace ofchange after 1973, the review said, and now they have completedthis transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupiedwith the strategies of retrenchment and survival which haveserved them well in recent years.    In order to encourage the construction of additionalsmelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higherlevel.    Production costs are likely to rise again in the yearsahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricitysuppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies,according to the review.    At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-pricescenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said.    Such a price development is not expected to cause anymarked competitive problems for the metal because of the likelyrise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in thepipeline for steel and copper.    In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said,as the world economy has not responded well to theopportunities offered by cheap oil.    Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higherin 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes. Reuter&#3;

China's top entrepreneur Rong Yiren, chairman of the ChinaInternational Investment and Trust Corporation (CITIC), whoalso represents Shanghai in the NPC, attacked the "profit beforeeverything" mentality which he said led to theft, embezzlementand extravagant gifts and banquets.    Public criticism of policy is rare in China.    The New China News Agency quoted comments by NPC members onPremier Zhao Ziyang's draft work program for the year ahead.    The rural lobby was active. Deputies from three provincessaid Zhao was not forceful enough in tackling their problems.One said the state had cut spending on agriculture from 11 pctof total capital investment in 1979 to three or four pct today."This is incompatible with the important place occupied byagriculture," he said.    Other deputies said the state had broken promises toimprove fertiliser, oil and seed supplies to their provinces.    Although another congress member was quoted by the agencyas saying Zhao's opening speech last week was "discreet,appropriate, comprehensive and assuring," others said thegovernment had spent too much or too little. One member saidpeople were worried about the state's budget deficit, projectedat more than two billion dlrs this year. Reuter&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, ECONOMISTS CUT AUSTRIAN GDP GROWTH FORECAST, The Institute for Economic Research(WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 grossdomestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pctforecast made last December.    WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he sawthe one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, asthe upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revisiondue to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.    A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oilproducing states, combined with the effects of the dollar'sfall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.    Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth thisyear. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, privateconsumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pctin 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.    Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2pct last year due to the slack economic activity.    Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficitof about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billionsurplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria'scentral bank, last month forecast the current account would beroughly in balance this year.    However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should haveno notable effect on the government's attempts to cut thebudget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, hesaid. REUTER&#3;

Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration wasaimed at "international markets" and that the figure of 400 mlndlrs given in some press reports "was probably about right."    European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit EridaniaZuccherifici Nazionali SpA &lt;ERDI.M>, is expected to absorb theEuropean corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc&lt;CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.    Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle tobuy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.    A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group wasstudying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugaralong with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, butgave no details.    The flotation plan has been interpreted by financialanalysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of theCPC business.    In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer&lt;Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzziwas "apparently still organising finance," his company mightstill succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business.    Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said the 630mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid "at thedate foreseen in the preliminary contract."    Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give anyindication of the likely timing of an offering of shares inEuropean Sugar, but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi'spurchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed bySeptember 30.    Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised anddisappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC'sEuropean business was apparently rejected in favour ofFerruzzi's lower bid.    Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said "Amylumshould know that one succeeds in a bid by making the rightoffer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the caseof the acquisition of CPC's European business."    Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concernhimself with the European Sugar capital raising operation understudy, he added.    Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up theEuropean Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPCbusiness, Gardini said: "We do not exclude having minoritypartners in the CPC business."

If the proposed public share offering was delayed beyondthen, Eurotunnel would have to find bridging finance, he toldreporters during a visit by French parliamentarians to theconstruction site of the French tunnel terminal.    Early elections in Britain could cause such a delay, henoted.    Britain's lower house of Parliament last month passed abill endorsing the construction of the 50-km (31-mile) tunnel.The bill still needs approval of the upper house of Lords.    Benard said the consortium had decided after lengthydiscussion to issue an identical mix of securities in theLondon and Paris markets, but details of the precise packagehad still to be decided.    The offering would comprise approximately three billionfrancs in each market with another 1.5 billion offered in theUnited States, Japan and other European markets. Timing will beset to take account of the French privatisation program.   Earlier this month a Eurotunnel official said theratification bill should go before the National Assembly (lowerhouse) early next month before passing to the Senate (upperhouse) at the end of May.

reut2-011.sgm, OECD SEES MAJOR ADJUSTMENT FOR AUSTRALIA, Australia faces a major medium termadjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance,the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development saidin its latest annual review of the Australian economy.    It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising externaldebt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs andinflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECDcountries.    A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basisfor sustained non-inflationary growth and externalcompetitiveness had improved, but economic performance overallhad sharply deteriorated since June 1985.    A major shift of real resources to the external sector --about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for theeconomy to expand in line with potential, for employment togrow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.    Success depended on the setting of right policies includingtighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sectorborrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.    Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expectedeconomic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighterfiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement intrade volumes.    It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored,the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct ofGDP by the first half of next year, while inflation wasprojected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct bymid-1988.    Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintainthe competitive edge created by the Australian dollar'sdepreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares inorder to encourage business investment.    The report urged Australia to broaden its export base bydeveloping viable and competitive service and manufacturingindustries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets tocorrect its external imbalances.    It added Australia should reduce protection levels inmanufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would nodoubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, U.S. SUGARBEET PLANTINGS SEEN RISING IN 1987, Representatives of U.S. sugar growerorganizations said they expect some increase the area plantedto sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987cane sugar crop also are good.    Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association,said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states,California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightlyin the largest producing state of Minnesota.    Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in themidwest, and this coupled with increases in California wouldincrease U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mlnacres sown last year.    USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.    The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowingsis that returns from competing crops such as soybeans andgrains are "just awful," said Carter.    In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers toplant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loanrate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers frombeet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, saidLuther Markwart, executive vice president of the Americansugarbeet growers association.    "The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,"Markwart said.    In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking acontract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.    USDA's report today will not include any harvested areaestimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaiiand Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.    Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texascane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  becausefor the first time in several years there was no winter freeze.Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year,cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.    In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year,but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields,said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian SugarPlanters Association.    The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more thanthe usual amount of attention this year because of mountingconcern that continued increases in domestic sugar productionthreaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.    The increases in beet plantings have especially causedconcern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings,particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.    "We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet andcane areas in more than five years," said Godfrey, adding thatthe U.S. may be due for a good weather year.    Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the Houseagriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, hasthreatened to offer legislation next year to curb domesticsweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Seafields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able tosell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lowerquality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgradedover the past several years.    The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxonmore of a spread in its refinery operations and added toearnings gains from refining and marketing.

Aikhomu repeated the government had not decided to removethe remaining petroleum subsidies.    He dismissed arguments that the move would increasehardships faced by the poor due to the government's tougheconomic adjustment programme as "sentimental and baseless."    Last year, the government cut fuel subsidies by 80 pct butthis has since been lost to the naira's depreciation which hasmade oil products cheap and a target of smuggling toneighbouring countries.

reut2-011.sgm, SOVIET UNION SEEN WATCHING CHINA GATT APPLICATION, China's application to join the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case bythe Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, atop European Community official said.    Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of theEuropean Communities, told a news conference that China'sapplication would involve long and difficult negotiations.    China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and inFebruary presented a memorandum backing its application, whichDe Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then bepresented to China.    "After China, other important state-trading countriesincluding the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession.China's application could be considered a test case," he said.    He said the EC strongly backed China's application, butothers among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.    Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economyentering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity andthe expectation that China will practice an open-trade policywithout trade discrimination, de Clercq added.    De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chineseeconomy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two currentSocialist GATT members.    On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchangeshortage would force China to import less this year and nextthan in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipmentand capital.    During his visit, De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders andtoday signed an agreement to open a European CommunityCommission office in Peking. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, DUTCH SEEK FOREIGN HELP IN TACKLING TAX FRAUD, The Dutch Finance Ministry said it isdiscussing with foreign fiscal authorities, primarily WestGerman and Belgian, possible means to combat evasion of tax oninterest payments received abroad.    Finance Minister Onno Ruding told parliament yesterday heaimed in 1988 to recoup about 100 mln guilders in tax revenueon interest income both at home and abroad, and a further 300mln by the end of 1990.    He expected Dutch banks soon to start automaticallyreporting interest payments they make, but this could promptmore investors to open foreign accounts, Ruding said.    There are no restrictions on Dutch capital flows, and theministry was therefore seeking co-operation from fiscalauthorities abroad to monitor interest paid on accounts held byDutch citizens, said spokesman Jaap Weeda.    Ruding was largely motivated by guidelines laid down in thecentre-right government's policy plan which calls for theministry to boost its income by one billion guilders by 1990.    Weeda said it was difficult to estimate taxation lostthrough undeclared interest income, but Ministry figuresindicated that about 20 pct of such income was not declared.    Ruding told parliament Dutch banks seemed willing toco-operate in plans to report on interest payments, but theyforesaw practical problems.    There was no firm target date for introducing reportingprocedures, but Ruding was adamant it must happen soon.    "I cannot and will not accept any delay," he said. REUTER&#3;

The Philips president said companies should join suchefforts in an attempt to gain a foothold in markets ofstrategic importance such as the U.S. And Japan.    Working together, firms could produce on a larger scale andmore cheaply by sharing business risks and pooling togetherdevelopment, marketing and production activities, he said.    As an example, Van der Klugt pointed to Philips'telecommunications joint venture with AT and T &lt;T.N> of theU.S. To form &lt;APT>, working on digital telephone exchangeprojects.    "Only the largest companies can recoup the billions ofdollars involved in development in this area," he said, addingthat the world market offered room for no more than seven oreight manufacturers of such products.

reut2-011.sgm, WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT, Unfavorable late winter weatherconditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslaviaindicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.    The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade toSubotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crophad been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spellthat followed a period of warm weather.    He said unseasonably warm weather in late February thatbrought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early wasfollowed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.    Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of whichshow stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leafand possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.    The report said that since much of the early growth inFebruary was from late seeding rather than from normaldevelopment, his view was that the damage may be more extensivethan some local observers say.    The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fieldson normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin andchances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.    However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorableand many of the fields had already been top-dressed, whichwould aid recovery. Reuter&#3;

Canadian Pacific's return on average capital employed fellto 4.7 pct in 1986 from 5.9 pct in the prior year. Return onaverage shareholders' equity declined to 2.5 pct from 4.8 pctin 1985.    "To achieve this goal will require that the businessescomprising Canadian Pacific are leaders in their respectivefields," the company said in the report to shareholders.    "Although the steps already taken to reposition and solidifyCanadian Pacific point to a better financial performance in1987, more remains to be accomplished if the company is toproduce returns that meet shareholder expectations," it said.    Canadian Pacific previously reported 1986 operating netprofit fell to 150.1 mln dlrs from 252.7 mln dlrs in the prioryear. Revenues were 15.02 billion dlrs compared to 15.04billion dlrs in 1985.    It said emphasis will continue on reducing dependence oncyclical industries and strengthening the asset mix.    Canadian Pacific said 1986 results were disappointing, butthe company took several steps towards reviewing assets andoperations and rationalizing its asset base.    As previously reported, it sold its 52.5 pct interest inCominco Ltd &lt;CLT> for 472 mln dlrs in October, 1986 andCanadian Pacific Airlines Ltd for 300 mln dlrs in January,1987.

The charges consisted of a 362.5 mln dlr writedownrepresenting permanent impairment in asset values, partiallyoffset by a gain of 102.6 mln dlrs on sale of its interest inCominco and a gain of 29.5 mln dlrs on sale of CP Hotels'flight kitchens.    Canadian Pacific said a further extraordinary net gain of172.5 mln dlrs from the airline unit sale will be included infirst quarter results.    Canadian Pacific said despite lower earnings andextraordinary charges, its overall cash position strengthenedin 1986 as cash generated from operations and asset sales wasmore than sufficient to finance capital expenditures of 1.80billion dlrs.    Long term debt fell to 4.50 billion dlrs from 6.22 billiondlrs in 1985.    Consolidated 1987 capital spending will be reducedconsiderably from 1986 levels, mainly due to the Cominco andair line unit sales, it said.

Damage was most severe on plants above the ground wherelittle or no snow cover was present, he added.

Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standingwater occurred in the fields.

The average trade guess for 1987 planted corn acreage was66.06 mln acres, ranging from 60.7 to 69.0 mln, all well belowthe 76.67 mln planted last year due to improved incentives bythe USDA for farmers to retire acres. Corn acres totalled only60.22 mln in 1983, when the PIK program was introduced.    The average soybean planted acreage quesstimate was 59.49mln, ranging from 58.0 to 63.0 mln and compared with the 61.48mln planted in 1986    With substantial grain stocks, less interest was expressedamong analysts in the USDA stocks report also scheduled today.

The company said it was taking the opportunity to changeits bylaws and incoroporation certificate following changes inthe law of New Jersey, where the company is incoporated.    The measures are being submitted to shareholders and willbe voted on at Exxon's annual meeting to be held May 21 in NewOrleans the company said in proxy material sent toshareholders.    Shareholders are being asked to approve an amendment to thecompany's certificate to eliminate directors' maximum personalmonetary liability to the limit New Jersey allows.    New Jersey recently permitted corporations to eliminatemonetary liability directors and owners may incur for breach ofduty care owed by them to corporations and shareholders.    The company said that the principal effect of the measure"will be to eliminate potential monetary damage actions againstdirectors."    But the amendment will only limit liability in the event ofunintentional errors.    It does not limit their liability for actions taken inknowing violation of the law, nor will it limit potentialliabilities from violations of federal securities laws, thecompany said in its proxy statemernt.    A second measure proposed to shareholders is an amendmentto bylaws already voted on by the directors at their JanuaryBoard meeting making indeminifiacation of directors mandatory.

Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva told reporters the planwas a blueprint for modernisation focusing on cuttingPortugal's 9.6 pct unemployment, or 400,000 people.    The program was approved at a cabinet meeting of the16-month-old Social Democratic Party (PSD) government.    The censure motion has been proposed by a centre-left partywhich says the government has failed to tackle economic ills.    Left-wing opposition parties, who together hold a majorityin parliament, have indicated they intend to vote against theminority government, which would automatically fall ifdefeated.    A first phase of the government plan foresees annual growthin investment of between eight and 10 pct over the next fouryears. Government figures show investment grew 10 pct last yearcompared with a fall of three pct in 1985.    The plan foresees this leading to creation of 32,000 newjobs a year.    The program also foresees government spending cuts,particularly in the public sector, reducing the state budgetdeficit to around five pct of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in1990 from nearly 11 pct in 1986.    Portugal's foreign debt, which totals more than 16 billiondlrs, was forecast to be reduced to the equivalent of 24 pct ofGDP in 1990 from around 55 pct at end-1986.

The ministry accepted 50 pct of bids at the issue price.Higher bids were met in full.    The loan, which has a May 1 coupon and paydate, will gotowards the government's financing of an estimated 1987borrowing requirement of about 42 billion guilders.    The 1987 budget deficit is some 29 billion guilders andearly repayments on state loans are estimated at 13 billion.    Because of projected early redemptions to the state ofloans by building corporations, analysts predict the state hasto raise 32 billion guilders on the capital markets this year,of which it has found 4.5 billion guilders on the privateplacement market.   The finance ministry described today's tender as successfuland said the amount raised reflected a change in marketcircumstances since the last loan issue together withinternational demand for guilder-denominated paper.    Following today's tender, the fourth state loan for paymentin 1987, a nominal 10.55 billion guilders has been raised bypublic issues, bringing the total raised this year to 18.55billion guilders, or some 44.2 pct of the state's 1987borrowing requirement.    The previous state loan, a 6.25 pct issue due 1998/2002last month, raised a mere 300 mln guilders.    Analysts said the small amount raised on the last issue wasbecause it was a return to a split maturity issue, seen as onlyattractive to domestic institutions, from bullet loans.    The finance ministry said then the amount was low but noteda number of unfavourable market conditions at the time.    Bullet loans have only been permitted in the Dutch marketsince January, 1986, as part of a financial liberalizationplan.    Bullet loans have attracted considerable foreign demand buthave also given rise to worries their fixed repayment datemight interfere with intricate redemption schemes built uparound previously issued split maturity bonds, dealers said.

Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters theeffects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year hadbeen harsher than thought earlier.    Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains inmid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing.    Last year's temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mlnbags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags.    The traders said another factor leading to lower croppredictions is that many farmers are not caring properly forplantations because of low returns on their investment.    Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back asfarmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over thepast six months coupled with low bean prices.    If such economies continue into the winter months both thetemporao and the developing October/April main crop could faceserious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which wouldnormally be treated against the disease.    Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolatedincidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions saythese are not yet significant.    The traders said they expect very low deliveries oftemporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and thebulk will not appear until the last month, September.    Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellentcondition and recent flowering and pod setting - which willlead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good. Reuter&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, U.S. TAX AGENCY INCREASES INTERNATIONAL AUDITS, The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)said it was stepping up compliance efforts by its internationalstaff to recover some of the billions of dollars lost each yearin unpaid taxes.    The agency was shifting emphasis by its internationalbranch to increase compliance by the 47,000 foreign-ownedAmerican companies and foreign firms operating in the UnitedStates, IRS officials said at a news conference.    The IRS also was taking a closer look at compliance byAmericans living abroad and by taxpayers in the United Stateswith income from overseas investments.    Percy Woodard, assistant IRS commissioner, international,denied that the agency was picking on foreign companies, but hesaid fewer of them pay taxes than comparable U.S. firms.    In some industries, one pct of foreign firms paid U.S.taxes, he said. Other IRS staff said the taxes paid by foreigncompanies ranged from 16 to 19 pct less than taxes paid by U.S.firms.    "If our taxpayers in another country are expected to fulfilltheir tax-paying responsibilities in that country, thenforeigners in our country can be expected to do the same thing,"Woodard said.    In addition, as many as 61 pct of the 2.5 mln Americans wholive abroad do not file tax returns, costing the government 2.3billion dlrs a year, Woodard said.    The total tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed andactually paid to the government -- is about 90 billion dlrs.    Millions of dollars are lost because Americans fail toreport foreign income and because U.S. businesses with foreignoperations can underreport income, Woodard said.    The IRS will increase compliance by reassigning 100    examiners to international tax returns, a 25-pct increase,which should lead to more tax return audits.    The IRS will study entire industries to spot trends orpractices by foreign-owned companies in their compliance withtax laws, Woodard said.    The IRS looked at the electronics industry first, butWoodard denied it was because of the trade dispute oversemiconductors between the United States and Japan.

reut2-011.sgm, CHIRAC, REAGAN DISCUSS ARMS CONTROL, TRADE, French Prime Minister Jacques Chiracopened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus onsuperpower arms control moves and trade issues.    French officials said a major aim of Chirac's visit was topresent France's concern that the United States might ignoreEuropean security interests in any accord with Moscow onremoving medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent.    But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will notagree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would givethe Russians superiority in shorter-range systems, diplomatssaid.    France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missilesfrom Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge inother weaponry, particularly shorter-range rockets,conventional forces and chemical weapons.    Speaking last night, Chirac set out the French positionsaying: "Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces shouldmention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles."    Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending adispute between two leading research institutes over patentrights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS.    In a joint statement, Chirac and Reagan said the PasteurInstitute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute, ofBethesda, Maryland, agreed to give part of the royalties fromthe test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fightagainst AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).    "This agreement opens a new era in Franco-Americancooperation, allowing France and the United States to jointheir efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes ofspeeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure," Reagansaid at the signing ceremony.     He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation.    The foundation would also raise private funds and woulddonate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in lessdeveloped countries.     Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and theUnited States during a welcoming ceremony in the White HouseEast Room, with Reagan describing France as "America's oldestally in war and peace."     "I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by thesame ideals of freedom, by the same will to face the dangerswhich we both confront -- terrorism, war, hunger, poverty, newdiseases and drugs," Chirac replied.    But the two countries are likely to have less to agree onover the issue of trade, where Chirac is worried about a risein protectionism in the U.S. Congress.     A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea tosell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way oflessening surplus stocks.    Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea, firstproposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume,during his two-day visit to Washington.    The U.S. official described the idea as a "grain producers'OPEC" -- a reference to the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries -- and said it went against the Reaganadministration's desire to lessen government intervention intrade.

reut2-011.sgm, CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER, Canada's airline industry, shaken up bya recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor forgovernment-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drivefor profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.    "Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,"said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd."Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market."    The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlrtakeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small butcash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last weekas Canadian Airlines International Ltd.    Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about ninepct.    Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive andcost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the truepotential of the former CP Air, which floundered for fourdecades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian PacificLtd.    They said CP Air's management style had been not muchdifferent from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, becauseneither airline was held accountable to its owners.    "Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, thesetwo airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neitherseemed that concerned about the bottom line," said Bradley.    "But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be veryconscious of profitability and shareholder return. And AirCanada is on the verge of going that way," he said.    CP Air, always fighting for market share rather thanprofits, was "a perennial money-loser," analyst Wilfred Hahn ofBache Securities Inc said in a recent report.    Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulatedlong-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, itslosses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.    Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later thisyear in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs onrevenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of morethan 2 billion dlrs.    Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold tothe public, the prospect of privatization at a time ofincreased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay moreattention to finances, analysts said.    It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit "inexcess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs" for 1986. However, this profitrecovery was due less to management skill than the fact thatall Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.    Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 inVancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.    For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct airtraffic growth, and they expect profits will come fromcost-cutting and careful spending.    Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd saidinstitutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to theirportfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that newcompetition makes profit growth less certain.    "The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. Atone time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobodyelse's," Friend said.    Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airlineshares for at least a year.    Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of apublic stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routeswithout setting off a political storm.    It also will be faced with an expensive but necessaryupdating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.    Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase ofa dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.    Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week orderedsix commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it wouldsoon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or theBoeing Co.    Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these withouthurting profits.    Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects CanadianAirlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western. Reuter&#3;

They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mlnbarrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3and four mln barrels.    Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as sixmln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged fromthe previous week or slightly higher or lower.    For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocksfell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw forthe week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chancegasoline stocks will be unchanged.    API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for theweek ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict asimilar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stocklevels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.    The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonalfactors but they said crude direction is harder to call.    Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week endedMarch 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week endedMarch 27.    API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized upthree pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts saidutilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell byless than one pct for the week ended March 27.

William Reynolds, chairman andchief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects toannounce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostiletender within a week.    Last night the company urged shareholders to reject thetender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying thegroup sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluateGenCorp while "we have had only 10 days to respond."    Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legalchallenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New YorkCity market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday.    Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gainof 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans tosell the station to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs.    Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges weredropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission hasalready approved the station's sale.    Money from the sale of the station will play a role inhelping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsoredby AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynoldssaid. He provided no other details.    Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chieffinancial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting,which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm.    Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after themeeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters.    Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family membershave been telling him "Bill, just don't pay greenmail" to endthe takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minorityshareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynoldssaid he considers it a "repugnant device."    Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors.Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns alarge block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board.Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to "stiffenthe backbone of the board to discourage greenmail."    Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that theyare open to negotiations with GenCorp.    Asked about severance contracts for key executives in theevent of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted"we're developing alternatives that would not result in achange in control."    Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to anyproposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, "Weknow the company, we know the values and we know theopportunities better than any outside group."    In response to a question about whether any units are upfor sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives. Reuter&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, TRADE WAR FEARS MAY PROMPT STOCK MARKETS' DOWNTURN, The threatened trade war between theUnited States and Japan is just the kind of shock thateconomists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin.    But they are not so sure if that would be a briefcorrective dip, or whether this week's falling share pricesmark the start of a "bear" market.    "It's the billion dollar question," said Richard O'Brien,economist at American Express International Bank in London.    Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- haspoured into share and bond markets around the world, and fundeda good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third ofany new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by theJapanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as thedollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets itfall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart ofimproving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar orbecause the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budgetdeficit.   And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese willhave less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill thegap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. Thesubsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major fallson the world stock markets.    "A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,"said O'Brien. "Now, it is much less certain."    Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a boomingeconomy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best inthe industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt andhuge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien.    Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of SmithBarney Harris Upham said  "We're still in a bull market," addingthat corrections are a normal part of a rising market and "Thebear usually strikes slowly."    Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co inLondon, said the huge sums of money going through the worldfinancial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.    Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money innon-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's verydifficult to see where else they can put their money than inU.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,according to David Butcher, a senior executive at YamaichiSecurities Co Ltd's bond operation in London.    He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention nowto the French franc and West German mark.    In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions andthe dollar's slide will mean for securities markets. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, TALKING POINT/BORG-WARNER CORP &lt;BOR>, Borg-Warner Corp will vigorouslyresist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but theMidwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer,either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe.    Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAFthrough a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner'sstock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.    Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman willstage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he canadd its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.    "It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question isnow do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they wantto remain independent," said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.    Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculationfor almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle,Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mlnBorg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.    Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took nosteps toward a transaction.    "Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them forthe last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporatebattles I've seen," said one analyst.    The battle, however, has heated up, and the range ofbreakup values on Wall Street span from the current marketprice to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said theythink a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.    Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily onits 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.    Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end upwith Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materialscompany in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted anunsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefitedfrom that company's restructuring.    "Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimateoffer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind ofbetween a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. Ipersonally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs pershare," said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.    Henderson also speculated the company might attempt arestructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire andRubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir JamesGoldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock andcarried out a wider share repurchase.    Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman isseeking "greenmail," or the repurchase of his stock by thecompany at a premium.    Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems withfinancing the transaction.    Previously associated with "junk bond" experts, DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warnertakeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tenderoffer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArnerboard and conditioned on the board's recommendation of thetender offer and merger.    Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects amerger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employeessince the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repaydebt from the transaction.    GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.   "I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at thelevel it is proposing it would enhance GAF share valuessubstantially," said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.    He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for thecompany's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF'scurrent holdings.    Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings.    The plastics are used in telephone equipment, officeequipment and appliances. "Borg has half the market in the U.S.and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,"Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW> andMonsanto Corp &lt;MTC>, he said.    Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and aprotective systems business, which includes Wells Fargosecurity guards. It also has an information services business,and is trying to sell its financial services business.    Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share onrevenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs pershare on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.

"I wish I could tell you that I am optimistic about thechances (of a settlement), but I am not," Liedtke said. "Iassure you, however, that we will continue to try."    He said that Pennzoil has made a number of settlementoffers to Texaco both before the litigation commenced andafter, but the offers were repeatedly rejected. He said Texacohas made no realistic offers.    Earlier this year, a Texas court of appeals upheldPennzoil's claim against Texaco, ruling that Texaco unlawfullyinterfered with Pennzoil's merger agreement with Getty Oil.Texaco subsequently acquired Getty.    Liedtke said it has become more difficult to settle thecase because the courts continually rule in its favor, raisingthe stakes of any agreement.    "Each time this goes up (to a higher court), theexpectations of our shareholders goes up and it puts us in anincreasingly difficult positon," he said.    "We cannot afford to settle this case for a pittance,"Liedtke told the meeting of analysts.    "We don't want to get sued for not fulfilling our fiduciaryresponsibilities," he said.    Liedtke also said that the company would not settle forless than two billion dlrs, which has been suggested by anumber of Wall Street analysts.    He did say, however, that Pennzoil would entertain anyproposal from Texaco including a possible preferred stockposition in TExaco.    "I won't assume we'll take it," he said. "But we'd considerit." But he added that he thought it would be extremelydifficult to work out a settlement made up of stocks, bonds andcash.    Liedtke, who earlier said the company would have a lowerfirst quarter, also told reporters that the company expectedlower earnings this year.    "We think earnings will probably be down this year," hesaid. Last year the company earned 1.28 dlrs a share fromcontinuing operations or 68.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.9billion dlrs.

He said it will allow foreign creditors to convert unpaidprivate sector debts into bolivar-denominated shares of stockin the debtor companies. the plan would be similar to thosealready in effect in other latin american nations, he said.    at least a half dozen such debt-equity swaps have alreadytaken place in venezuela. In 1984, a group of 17 U.S. Banks ledby citibank converted 18.3 mln dlrs of debt from the cerveceranacional, into 30 pct of the beer company'stock.    Anzola said exchange agreement no. 4 will also allow forconversion of public sector debt into investments in venezuelanprivate industry.    Holders of venezuelan public debt bonds would be able toexchange them for bolivar-denominated bonds at up to 100 pct oftheir nominal value, which could be turned into privateinvestment in priority areas.

Noting that there are "enormous pressures in the Congressand the land" for the United States to take a tough stand, hesaid, "This was a case where we felt we simply had to act."

He said in a speech to an export-import group that he wassure the United States and Japan could work out their disputeover unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade,but "I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out."    Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.    He also said he did not think there would be a trade warwith Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to theUnited States to risk such a war.    "Those fears are unfounded," he said.    He told reporters later that the sharp drop in thesecurities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fearof inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.    Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in thevalue of the dollar, although trade issues did have someeffect.

At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they wouldpropose expanding EEP to include all countries "willing topurchase additional commodities at reasonable prices."    In addition, the Congressmen said they would proposeextending the life of EEP to five years from the current threeyears and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billiondlrs from 1.5 billion at present.    The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin draftingamendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House.    Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture SecretaryRichard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said theyfavor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of anacross-the-board program which they termed too costly.    The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer anamendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. AgricultureDepartment to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at themarket value, rather than the cost of acquisition.    But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market valueaccounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoidhitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs.    Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mlndlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Usingacquisition value, USDA officials said the value is higher. Reuter&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, DUTCH MINISTER ATTACKS W. GERMAN FARM POSITION, Dutch Agriculture Minister GerritBraks said today the Netherlands deeply regretted West Germanopposition to radical reforms aimed at halting unwantedEuropean Community (EC) food production.    Braks told journalists he had rounded on his West Germancounter-part Ignaz Kiechle and accused Bonn of "lacking thecourage to tell farmers their methods were outdated" during aprivate meeting of Christian Democrat politicians on Sunday.    Braks said he told Kiechle: "You (Bonn) have had years toput your house in order and failed to do so."    His comments came shortly before EC ministers failed toreach agreement at two days of talks on prices to be paid to ECfarmers from the start of the new crop year on April 1.    The ministers agreed to roll over the present year for twomonths and resume negotiations in Luxembourg next month.    The proposals from the EC's Brussels headquarters wouldslash guaranteed prices paid to producers and seek to peg farmspending at its current two-thirds share of a total budget of36.2 billion European Currency Units (41 billion dlrs).    The attack from Braks comes at a time when relationsbetween the EC's Executive Commission, which has proposed thereform measures, and Bonn are at an all-time low.    The entire 17-man Commission is today visiting Bonn, oncethe most enthusiastic EC member, in an attempt to overcomedifferences largely resulting from bids to rein in out ofcontrol agricultural expenditure.    Kiechle, who yesterday denounced as totally unacceptablenew limits on producers' rights to sell unlimited amounts ofexcess products into Community warehouses, warned the meetingthe measures lead to political instability in his country.    He said they did not even form the basis of negotiation andstressed they were opposed by all political parties in thecountry.    The issue of farm reform has been pushed to the top of theCommunity's agenda by the group's protracted financial crisesand by growing international tension over farm surpluses andsubsidies.

reut2-011.sgm, ROYAL DUTCH &lt;RD> OBJECT OF SHAREHOLDER CAMPAIGN, Sponsors of a campaign to pressureRoyal Dutch Petroleum Co to suspend operations in South Africaclaimed the backing of church groups and other institutions whocollectively own 4.8 mln of the the company's approximately268.0 mln shares.    "We're seeking to have the company disinvest in SouthAfrica - that means get out," Harrison Goldin, comptroller ofNew York City told a news conference.    The immediate goal of the campaign is to enlist the supportof owners of 27 mln shares to force an unprecedented specialmeeting of shareholders, Goldin said.    Goldin appeared at the news conference with Gordon Smith,treasurer of the ministers and missionaries benefit board ofthe American Baptist Churches.    The 4.8 mln shares represented by the group includes fourretirement funds covering various groups of New York Cityworkers, the California State Teachers Retirement System andseven church-related groups.    Goldin said the ultimate aim of the group is to "tightenthe noose of economic pressure on South Africa" until thegovernment changes its apartheid policies.    A reprsentative of Shell Oil Co, the U.S. arm of RoyalDutch, distributed a statement after the news conferenceexplaining that the company supports a program of power sharingby all South Africans.    The statement said senior officials of the company havestated publicly that they regard apartheid as "a system whollyat variance with the principles on which our group of companieshas operated all over the world for many years."    Goldin said the group seeks a special meeting because thecompany has rejected efforts to have South African issuesplaced on a ballot for the annual meeting in May.    Goldin said the shareholders have no particular timetablefor the special meeting. "We are dealing with an effort toarouse public opinion," he said, asserting that it is notnecessary to have a majority of the votes. "Large companiesrespond when they see which way the wind is blowing."    An immediate goal is to get Shell to stop selling fuel toSouth Afria's military and police, he said.    Smith said the campaign against Shell breaks new ground inthe cooperation of institutional investors on social issues. Anofficial of the United Mine Workers outlined a previouslyannounced boycott of Royal Dutch/Shell products. Reuter&#3;

Therese, Quebec, plant and has received 220mln dlrs in interest-free government loans for the project.    GM Canada said the Canadian and Quebec governments are eachproviding a 110 mln dlr loan for the upgrading.    The company said much of the investment will be used tobuild a paint complex, which will make the plant competitivewith other GM plants in the U.S. and Canada.    The 450-mln-dlr investment includes the cost of retoolingthe plant to assemble front-wheel drive Chevrolet Celebritycars, which will be produced at Ste. Therese, beginning in May,GM Canada said.    "With the new paint complex and tooling, our plant will befully modernized to be world competitive," GM Canada presidentGeorge Peapples told a news conference.    He said construction will begin this year on the modernbase coat/clear coat paint complex, which will provide enhancedcolor standards and improved paint quality, he said.    The Canadian government said the modernization willguarantee continued long-term employment for about 3,500assembly line workers at the Ste. Therese plant and for about4,300 people employed in supply jobs in Ontario and Quebec.    "Without our participation...we faced the prospect oflosing this plant," said Michel Cote, Canadian minister ofregional industrial expansion.    Cote said he expected 3,100 new supplier jobs will becreated by the increased production in Ste. Therese.    The project will transfer the company's front-wheel drive"A" car production to Ste. Therese from Oshawa, Ontario andwill not increase the Ste Therese plant's capacity, GM Canadasaid.    It said it has produced 2.5 mln vehicles at the Ste.Therese plant since 1965.    The paint plant is expected to cost 200 to 250 mln dlrs andbegin operation in two years, Peapples told reporters after theannouncement.    The retooling included in the project had been announced inDecember but the company had not put a value on the retoolingcosts, he said.    Peapples estimated the interest-free loans could save GMCanada about 60 mln dlrs at a 10 pct interest rate.    He said the loans are repayable in full in 30 years if GMkeeps the plant open. If the company closes the plant in the1990s, it will have to pay the federal and provincialgovernments a total 75 mln dlrs of the loan by 1991.    Peapples said GM Canada asked for the government loansbecause, due to an expected overcapacity in the auto industryin the 1990s, the company was not prepared to take the risksinvolved in the investment by itself.    GM Canada said the level of support offered by thegovernments is consistent with aid provided to auto assemblersin the U.S.    Peapples said the company expects very strong demand in thenext decade for the type of mid-size, front wheel drive carthat will be produced at Ste. Therese.    Cote added that GM Canada's 1985 sales of 18.5 billion dlrsrepresented four pct of Canada's gross domestic product. Reuter&#3;

"From our point of view, it's a question of entering intonegotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes tocontracts to reflect the changes that are going to take placeon June 1," spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to aquery.    Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspendedits oil supply contracts, Cote said: "It's not a question ofcancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point."    On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Boardwill lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system,regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on atrial basis to the end of 1987.    Under the new system, producers and refiners will beallowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be deliveredunder purchase contracts.    Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount ofoil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners.    "We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, andwe've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing hasbeen finalized," Imperial's manager of western crude supply GaryStrong said.

reut2-011.sgm, GM &lt;GM> LABOR STRIFE PRECURSOR TO TOUGH TALKS, General Motors Corp's relationship withits hourly employees has turned ugly, and security analysts saythe discord forebodes tough talks this fall on a new nationallabor contract at General Motors.    General Motors' dealings with the United Auto Workers,marred in recent months by strikes and a contract rejections,shows few signs of improving as it tries to regain the leadfrom Ford Motor Co &lt;F> as the richest U.S. auto company.    Analysts say the automaker might have to endure a majorstrike this fall before the situation is resolved.    "There is a lot of tension between the workers and GM,"says Michael Luckey, analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers.    Last week's four-day walkout by 9,000 UAW workers atPontiac, Mich., follows longer strikes at two General Motorsparts plants in the past year and rejection of proposedcontracts at other facilities.    Analysts say the Pontiac strike will not be the last to hitthe company.    Other plant strikes are likely, and chances are high thatthe UAW will call a company-wide walkout against GM this fall,says Luckey.    "There is a good chance there will be a strike," saysSalomon Brothers analyst Jean-Claude Gruet.    "GM is acting as if they would welcome a strike," said RonGlantz, analyst with Montgomery Securities.    "It has been my experience the UAW strikes people theydon't like. They don't like GM," says Glantz.    General Motors might also be faced with wildcat strikes, orwalkouts by local union units that are not endorsed by theunion's central committee, analysts said.    General Motors will not comment on the talks, saying onlyit is seeking to become a "world-class competitor."    Elements for a tough set of labor talks are in place."There is a lot of pressure on both sides. (General Motorschairman Roger) Smith is under pressure from stockholders. Theunion is fighting to protect its members. Something has got togive," Luckey says.    The consensus on Wall Street is that General Motors will bechosen as the "strike target", or the main company with whichit will negotiate in the fall talks to decide the nextthree-year national contract.    "You get a feeling from talking with GM that they want tobe the strike target because (they feel) Ford might capitulatetoo easily," says Glantz.    The negotiations, expected to begin in late July, willdecide the major wage, benefit and job security issues thatwill cover most U.S. autoworkers. The current contract expiresSeptember 15.    Job security and "outsourcing", the  subcontracting of jobsto non-UAW labor, are expected to be the main issues.    "You're going to see a rough set of negotiations,particularly if they can't get the outsourcing issue decided,"says one former General Motors human relations executive.    Some analysts point out that if the UAW decides to focus onwages, it might pick Ford as the strike target because ofFord's higher earnings last year.    "You may see a situation where the UAW bargains with thetwo separately," breaking its historical pattern, says Luckey.    The number of cars building up in dealer showrooms mightindicate General Motors is preparing for a confrontation withthe union, analysts say.    The company will have 95 days' supply of cars in dealershowrooms at the end of March, Lucky estimates. Analysts say 50to 65-days' supply is normal.   General Motors wants to enter the negotiations "with enoughinventory that it won't feel a six-week strike," says Glantz.    Some in the industry say that, despite the closing of 11plants and indefinite layoff of 37,000 workers, furtherclosings and layoffs might be coming.    A General Motors spokesman says it is "too early" to knowwhether plant closures will become an issue in the talks.    The former General Motors executive says more closures arelikely after a new UAW agreement is reached, but he adds,"you're not going to see it before the contract," he says.    Lucky says 10 pct of General Motors's components plants areon the "red list" of companies likely to be shut. "It wouldtake a miracle for them to survive," he says. Reuter&#3;

Last week, GAF had purchased additional shares of thecompany for 40-1/8 dlrs, increasing its stake in Borg-Warner to19.9 pct.    In 1985, GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire UnionCarbide Corp for five billion dlrs, and has since expressed aninterest in acquiring a chemical company that would complementits own chemical business.    When asked whether GAF would consider selling thenon-chemical assets of Borg-Warner if its takeover offer isaccepted, Heyman declined to comment.    He also refused to say whether GAF would considerincreasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if theinitial proposal is rejected.

reut2-011.sgm, DOME PETE&lt;DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN, Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlierreporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlierprofit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to writedowns totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction indeferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs.    The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreignexchange losses, the company said.    "The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reversesmuch of the progress the company has made in the two previousyears," Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.    "But even a net loss of this magnitude has very littlebearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome," chairmanMacdonald said.    "It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of thecompany's assets in today's economic environment, and theabsolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenderson a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continuedexistence," he added.    Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan forrestructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs.    Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulatedforeign exchange losses to current expenses because of theuncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan.    Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remainingperiod of the loans to which they apply, it said.    Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarterreduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to acharge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly inthe third quarter.    Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter chargeresulted from a year-end accounting change made under new fullcost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute ofChartered Accountants.    The company said it previously determined a write down ofconventional oil and gas properties was not required atSeptember 30, under the previous method of calculating thelimitation of oil and gas values.    Dome said the most significant accounting change under thenew guidelines is using current oil and gas prices incalculations instead of escalating price forecasts.    Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan precludethe company from making an accurate estimate of futurefinancing costs, which are used in the new accountingcalculations, it said.    As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantiallyconform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securitiesand Exchange Commission, the company said.    Dome said operating income from its crude oil and naturalgas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.    Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gasoperating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billiondlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.    Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization ofDome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea alsocontributed to the decline, it said.    Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.    Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.    Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintainedat prior year's levels through new drilling activity andimprovements in productivity.    Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result oflower domestic and export sales, it said.    Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year.    Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a dayfrom 591.0 mcf a day.

The accounting change will not affect the company's cashposition and the company intends to continue paying itsdividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.    Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or2.60 dlrs per share.    Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted bydelays in the receipt of a California Public UtilitiesCommission decision on the company's 1984 application for raterelief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructingunits one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project.    It said the commission is currently allowing the company torecover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.    As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each monthas deferred non-cash account receivable, which has beenincluded in current income.    But the accounting change, effective January 1, willreflect only cash received through interim rates approved bythe commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.

reut2-011.sgm, IMF SEES INDUSTRIAL NATIONS GROWING ONLY 2.5 PCT, The International Monetary Fundpredicts that the industrial world will grow a sluggish 2.5 pctin 1987, a sharp drop from the more than three pct forecast sixmonths ago, monetary sources said.    The forecasts, prepared by the IMF staff, will form thebasis of a debate on economic policy coordination by officialsof top industrial nations at high-level meetings next week.    The sources said the IMF predicts an expansion of just 2.5pct in the U.S., shaving a full one point off its original 1987forecast, released last fall.    The figures will be discussed by the IMF's executive boardbefore going to the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee herenext week and may be subject to slight revision, they said.    The Reagan administration has forecast 3.2 pct U.S.economic growth this year while more pessimistic Fed officialsare predicting 2.5 to three pct.    The sources said the IMF also predicts growth of around 2.5 pct in West Germany, and 2.8 pct in Japan.    Washington has extracted promises from both West Germanyand Japan that they will take measures to bolster theirdomestic economic growth, to help reduce the massive gapbetween their huge trade surpluses and the record Americantrade deficit.    Poor economic growth figures in these two nations and theU.S. are likely to do little to reassure currency markets.    In recent days, the dollar has come under heavy sellingpressure as markets have grown cynical that Bonn and Tokyo willtake early action.    With no economic stimulus in sight, financial markets havereduced the dollar's value to levels that are more likely tobalance U.S. trade, monetary analysts say.    Monetary sources also said the IMF forecasts overall growthin developing nations of around three pct this year, withdeveloping countries in the western hemisphere -- theCaribbean, Central and South America -- expanding 3.3 pct.    In its recent annual report, the Inter-American DevelopmentBank said Latin American nations need to expand between fourand five pct this year to service their 382 billion dlrs offoreign debt.    Non-oil exporting Third World nations should achieve anexpansion of around four per cent while oil exporting nationswill average almost no growth at all, the sources said.    Also short of the mark is the level of industrial countrygrowth. Western officials maintain the industrial world needsto expand at least three per cent annually -- against thisyear's initial IMF prediction of 2.5 pct -- in order to supportthe export drive of debtor nations.    Exports provide the indebted world, which owes westerncreditors some 900 billion dlrs, with its principal source offoreign exchange for debt repayments.    In other forecasts, the IMF put overall global growth atabout 2.8 pct and output in the seven leading industrialnations at around 2.5 pct.    The seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany,Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- have become the main forumfor coordination of medium-term economic policies in theindustrial world. The prediction for the seven is also around2.5 pct growth in 1987.    The Fund put Canadian growth at about 2.7 pct, the Frenchexpansion at 2.9 pct and Britain at 2.8 pct.    The figures will be discussed as part of an overall debateon the World Economic Outlook and the U.S. debt strategy by theInterim Committee.    Those talks are one of several meetings between topeconomic officials of industrial and developing nations duringthe semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. Reuter&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED, The surge in currency futures sinceFriday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposedtariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in thecoming week, financial analysts said.    "The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect itto last a little longer," said Craig Sloane, a currency analystwith Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co.    Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of somemomentum today, is likely to continue, he said.    Central banks are likely to play a role in halting theadvance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said,even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against theJapanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention.    Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with hisrefusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a noteof stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said.    Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Hornersaid G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force oftheir commitment to the Paris accord.    "I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind thescenes," Horner said.    Horner said more forceful central bank intervention willfirm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures.    "Coordinated, punishing intervention" by the central banks-- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which hasonly smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according toHorner.    "I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans(currencies)," he said.     On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, whichset a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract,is at 0.007050, Horner said.    Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet topeak.    "The basic trend in the currencies is higher," said AnneParker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman BrothersInc. "The market wants to take the dollar lower."    Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over aG-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of theInternational Monetary Fund could make for choppy priceactivity the remainder of the week, Mills said.    In addition, although the market shrugged off relativelyhealthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators andfactory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger rolein coming sessions, the analysts said.    Friday's employment statistics in particular will beclosely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar. Reuter&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, GRAIN REPORTS IMPROVE U.S. FARM OUTLOOK-ANALYSTS, The U.S. grain planting intentions andstocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, agrain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.    The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocksare "the first report we've had for a long time that shows anyoptimism for anybody," said John "Bud" Frazier, grain analystand executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.    "I'm really excited about it," Frazier said.    The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend toplant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted lastyear, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.    The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels ofsoybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushelsof wheat, all below trade guesses.    Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analystwith AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Tradepanel to discuss the reports.    Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendlyfor the market, and soybean prices would jump three to fivecents a bushel "if the bell rang right now."    "We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn andsoybeans) than we thought we had," he said, noting that hog andpoultry production is up.    "We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,"said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and15 pct in the preceding quarter.    However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceedconsumption.    She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres camein southeastern states, where yields are usually low.    "We have the potential for record breaking soybean yieldsthis year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow'sopening," she said.    Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and thecrop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down fromlast year's 8.25 billion bushels.    "We'll need very good disappearance next year to reducestocks," she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last yearat 6.7 billion bushels.    Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the longterm, "But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks downto where we could start rebuilding prices."    Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage reportcould prompt farmers to change their plans and plant moresoybeans.    The panelists agreed that the reports should discouragetalk of revising the 1985 farm bill.    "There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm lawwe're working under today, and this report should reinforcethat," Frazier said.    "We are seeing the program beginning to work," said Meyer.

Israelis are one of the most heavily taxed people in theworld. Under the new budget, about a quarter of which will goto defence, highest wage earners will pay income tax of 48 percent instead of the current 60 per cent.    The bill passed less than an hour before the start of thenew fiscal year on April 1. It was held up by debates overspecific programs such as education fees and social benefitsfor low wage earners.    The radio said the budget passed by a wide majority. Lastyear's budget was about 19 billion dollars.    In January, Israel devalued its shekel currency by 9.75 percent against the U.S. Dollar and the government agreed to lowertaxes of high wage-earners in an effort to stimulate exportsand productivity.    The government, trade unions and industrialists in Januaryalso agreed to extend 18-month-old price controls until March1988 in an effort to avert labour unrest and a return to hyper-inflation.

reut2-011.sgm, ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE, Quarter-point prime rate increases to7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will befollowed by other banks only after they see clearer signs ofthe Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.    "Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and theprime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, butno rush is likely," said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.    Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed byChase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.    McCulley said that once the spread between three-monthcertificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a primerate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until theysee what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the nearterm, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like tofollow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when bankslifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discountrate increase in April of that year.    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate sincelast August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pctshortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to thecurrent 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.    "The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. Thereshould be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct," said David Jones of Aubrey G.Lanston and Co.    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today'smeeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed maywell foster higher interest rates soon.    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policychange today, it may have decided to apply slight upward ratepressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heatup or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.    "The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend totighten policy when they did today's coupon pass," said JosephLiro of S.G. Warburg and Co.    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, theFed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system byoffering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds forits own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a "pass."    "The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policychange," said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean WitterReynolds Inc.     She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and theprime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is notreally narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rateincrease.    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise"may have been less a response to interest rates than anattempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line."    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans todeveloping countries, large money center banks with heavyexposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate inan effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight moneyto one another could help determine how many banks match thehigher prime rate and also how quickly they move.    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost offunds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federalfunds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.      The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflectingdemand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and theclose of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between fiveand 6-3/4 pct.    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the fundsrate probably will return to its recent trading level in the6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to manythat the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates tohelp the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly. Reuter&#3;

The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements receiveda qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co.The auditors said their opinion was subject to First Cityeventually obtaining additional capital.    "The company believes that in order to address itslong-term needs and return to a satisfactory level ofoperations, it will ultimately need several hundred milliondollars of additional capital, or a combination with a morestrongly capitalized entity," First City said in a note to itsfinancial statements included in the annual report.    "Management believes that sufficient resources should beavailable to cover interim capital concerns while additionalcapital is being sought," the bank said.    To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sellor mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributionsto its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some ofits member banks.    "The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially lessthan in 1986," First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letterincluded in the annual report. "However, the ultimate return tosatisfactory operating conditions is dependent on thesuccessful resolution of the related problems of creditquality, funding and the eventual need for substantialadditional capital."    First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of acredit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most ofFirst City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments wouldbe modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoiddefault.    The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenantslast year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks.    Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratiosexceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986,First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. FirstCity National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio.    Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estateprices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrslast year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more thandoubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of1986.    First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its totalenergy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billiondlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs "shouldbe more modest." The amount represented 15 pct of First City'stotal loans.    In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assetsnearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end.Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or ninepct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amountcould go higher.    "The company still faces uncertainties in the real estatemarket and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolioso long as the regional recession persists," First City said."Because the carrying value of many of these loans iscollateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value ofthe collateral base could cause an increase in the level ofreal estate-related chargeoffs."

reut2-011.sgm, U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX, The complex task of wielding controlover monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving globaleconomy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, thenewest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.    Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in themaking of monetary policy. But they would be given a muchgreater role under an idea being floated by Governor RobertHeller, who joined the board last August.    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, butargues that such an arrangement, particularly if it wereadopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce thevolatility of exchange rates.    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices ofcommodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.    His idea, which many conservative economists findappealing, has some backing among board members appointed inrecent years by President Reagan.    It would complement the present system of opening orclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall ofthe money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead tochanges in interest rates and affect economic activitydirectly.    Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity conceptis part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetarypolicy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solidbase.    "What is needed is an anchor or reference point that canserve as a guide for both domestic and international monetarypurposes," says Heller.    In the past, this anchor was gold but the United Stateswent off the gold standard because the global economy hadvastly outstripped gold supplies.    A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out ofhand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largestproducers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.    The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.    But the current system of floating currencies in whichcurrencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to themonetary system, is also being widely questioned.    Some have suggested that the system might benefit from aformal approach that mandates intervention by countries whencurrencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there aremajor problems with this also.    For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countriesmight be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might bedetrimental to their own domestic economy.    Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention canmake much of an inpact if the overall market does not agreewith the fundamental judgement.    The poorest countries have called for a monetary conferenceto work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps themcope with their overpowering debt problems.    Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration'schief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-calledGroup of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as aforum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and othereconomic matters.   He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behindclosed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from publicposturing.   The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have aprofound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices andinternational exchange rates.    As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 majorcommodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put togetherand prices would be measured on a regular basis.    "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy mightbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montarypolicy might be eased," he says.    He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auctionmarkets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on avirtually continuous basis.    Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed andtraded on a world-wide basis, so "that an index has a relevancefor the entire world," he says.    In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of theproduction chain and serve as an imput into virtually allproduction processes.    "Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitiveindicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,the monetary authorities may take such an index into account inmaking their monetary policy decisions," he says.    However, he says that any major change in a basic commoditysuch as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action bythe OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.    He says the worst thing that could happen is to allowmonetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodityto the rest of the system and to other commodities. Reuter&#3;

The company said the tender offer is the first step in aplan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares.    Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remainingPurolator share outstanding.    On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a shareleveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF HuttonLBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc.    Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open mergerdiscussions with Purolator before the company accepted themanagement-led buyout offer.    In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady,Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would stillprefer to negotiate with Purolator.    But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyoutgroup's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicitedtender offer of its own.    Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST onApril 28, unless extended.    The company said conditions of the offer include thereceipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's sharesoutstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of itsshare purchase rights plan.    Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of thepreviously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations.    Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan GuarantyTrust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing forthe tender offer.    It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued inthe subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate,payable twice a year.    For the first three years after the notes are issued,interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or inadditional notes, Emery said.    It added that the notes will not be subject to redemptionfor one year after they are issued.    Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unitof the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator'smanagement would continue with the company.    "We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fitwith each other and that the combination will enable each of usto better serve our existing customers and meet the challengesof the future," Emery's chairman said in his letter.    He said a merger would significantly enhance the financialturnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast.    Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached forcomment on the offer, which was released several hours afterthe stock market had closed.    Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.    Purolator closed at 34-7/8, off 5/8. Reuter&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND, "If we go on using upfarmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in20 years to grow grain on."    Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village onthe edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as ittries to feed its more than one billion people and at the sametime let them get richer by building factories and new homes.    China has to feed one quarter of the world's population,but only one seventh of its land is arable.    Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China intoa net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in1986.    But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside whichhas occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land forfactories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.    Official figures show that China lost just under one pct ofits arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smalleramount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed duringthe two years.    "We lost very little land prior to 1980 when theindustrialisation began," official Xu said. "Since then, nearlyall the families in the county have built new homes and manyfactories have gone up."    "Last year we lost land to a new railway line," Xu said. Butland losses in future should fall because nearly all familiesalready have new houses, she added.    The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to thePeking leadership, which announced earlier this month thatChina will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain landfor the first time this year.    "The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious," saidan article in the official press explaining the new measures.    "It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland," itsaid. "China has a large population and its land resources arebadly deficient."    An official of the Shanghai city government said countyauthorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares ofarable land to other uses, while anything more than that mustbe approved by the city government.   The Peking government faces another major obstacle in itsefforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. Theprices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, makingit more profitable for them to grow other crops.    To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliserand diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts tobuy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices toChina's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidisegrain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.    Some officials argue that the simplest solution to theproblem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.    Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in theeastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened toomuch to the demands of "selfish city people" and could raise citygrain prices without any problem.    But the government has ruled out a price rise. "Raising theprice of grain would directly conflict with the goal of socialstability," said a China Daily editorial this month.    The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over thelong term. "We must be very careful. We have a very largepopulation which is used to price stability and will object toprice rises," he said. "The problem is how to do it."    The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices mightalso affect the prices of hundreds of food products made withgrain and consumed by city residents.    In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequateinvestment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.    The official press has reported that farmers fear farmpolicy may change and they are putting their new wealth intobuilding graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.    Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers signcontracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.    "As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost atthe halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about thefuture," the China Daily said in an editorial last month.    Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed touse the land but not own it. For most of the period ofCommunist rule, the land was organised into collectives wherethere was little room for individual initiative.    "New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistencyof government policies and make them interested in long-terminvestment," the newspaper said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-011.sgm, CHINA OFFICIAL CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT GRAIN POLICY, The grain output of a major Chinesegrain-producing province is not increasing, because farmerslack incentives, production costs are rising, storagefacilities are poor and there is not enough state investment ingrain, the province's vice-governor said.    The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton asthey could growing grain, and three times as much growing cashcrops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pctof farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investmenthad caused the area of irrigated land to fall.    Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pctof the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.    He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain washit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and afurther 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.    He said government measures to deal with the problem dealtwith trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for moreinvestment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal useof or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called thetendency to rely on grain imports.    The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate tothe National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He saidthe government had cut agricultural investment to three to fourpct from 11 pct.    "With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past fewyears, some people got carried away, relaxing their attentionto grain and cotton production," he said.    On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to beself-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from thenortheast, but it imports wheat.    "Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reachthe 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be consideredadequate," Tian said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-011.sgm, REAGAN SETS FIRM RULES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF, President Reagan made public adetailed set of orders to his national security staff designedto prevent scandals similar to the Iran arms affair.    In a message to Congress accompanying National SecurityDecision Directive (NSDD) 266, Reagan said: "(The reforms) areevidence of my determination to return to proper procedures,including consultation with the Congress."    NSDDs are normally classified. Officials said this was thefirst time the duties of the national security staff had beenspelled out in such a document since the National SecurityCouncil (NSC) was set up by Congress 40 years ago.    The orders implement the recommendations of the TowerCommission, named by the president to investigate the secretU.S. Arms sales to Iran and led by former Senator John Tower.    In a scathing report on February 26, the panel blasted theconduct of the NSC staff and criticised the president for beingunaware of many of the activities of his subordinates.    Reagan accepted the report's conclusions in a speech onMarch 4 and said he had barred NSC staff from conducting covertoperations. The prohibition is laid out in NSDD 266 which callsfor a "small, highly competent (NSC staff) broadly experiencedin the making of national security policy."    NSDD 266 said the organization should impose "clear verticallines of control and accountability."    The eight page document said the NSC's use of privateindividuals and organisations as intermediaries to conductcovert activities would be "appropriately limited and subject toclose observation."    It said the NSC staff should include a legal adviser whowould have access to all information.

reut2-011.sgm, COMMERZBANK SEES LOWER OPERATING PROFIT THIS YEAR, Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> managementboard chairman Walter Seipp said that from the presentviewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to belower than in 1986.    In the first two months of the year, partial operatingprofit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account -declined, he said, without giving details.    The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of thequiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly.By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased.    German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seippsaid last year the figure for the first time had topped onebillion marks for the parent bank, and the group result wasaround 50 pct higher than this.    Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, "we were able to raise thefull operating profit...Slightly above the record result of1985 because own account profits increased slightly."    He gave no concrete details but added that in January andFebruary, good own account trading profits meant that the dropin full operating earnings was more modest than that in thepartial operating figure.    The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented infuture, developing, for example, more into investment banking,keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampeningexpenditures on fixed assets.    Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there hadbeen a strong growth in business volume.    Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added.    Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15billion. It would have been around five billion marks higherstill if currency relationships had remained unchanged.    In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct inthe year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56pct despite pressure on credit rates.    The surplus on commission business, which had soared by aquarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almostexclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said.    Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at morethan 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pctto more than 650 mln.    As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit roseby 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks.    Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last yearfrom 233 mln in 1985.    Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a "hightwo-figure million" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG&lt;AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F> during the latter'smajority stake purchase booked last year.    The ability of the bank to write off depreciations incredit business against profits from securities trading andearnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prioryears, to its full extent.    Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far thelargest part of the provisions were set aside for individualwrite-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle ofproblem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio ofcredit exposure to provisions improved further.    Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure toproblem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped intodollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks.    "This means that no open currency positions exist any longeron the amount of the provision that is made against an actualdefault," he added.    Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in thelast few weeks, he said, the international banking community isbetter armed than it was against payment problems.    All banks had significantly strengthened their capitalbase, most European banks had made considerable provisionsagainst bad debts while goverments and central banks werebetter prepared for unforseen difficulties.    He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting newapproach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot ofinterest in direct investment via an equity participation inLatin America, particularly from West German firms. Reuter&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, SEIPP SAYS GERMAN INTEREST RATES SHOULD FALL, The Bundesbank should take furthersteps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark fromfurther appreciation and to persuade investors to bringlong-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> managementboard chairman Walter Seipp said.    But he told the bank's annual news conference this did notmean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction inmoney market rates through bringing the allocation rates downfor Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements.    "Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates," he said."The money market rates are the important ones."    Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocatingmoney market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recenttender allocations.    An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss ofcredibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetarygrowth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware ofthe high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capitalformation, braking the expansion of money supply.    "Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation ofmonetary growth both at the same time," he added.    Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black apicture of the German economy, since company profitability hadimproved over recent years and domestic oriented firms wereprofiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark.    Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said,describing the downturn in production in the first months as afalse start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year.    After an economic contraction in the first quarter, theeconomy should show an uptrend in the last three. "We don'tbelieve that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a'growth dip,'" Seipp said.    But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscalpolicy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax shouldbe brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct.    The additional tax cuts brought forward to next Januarywere no substitute for support for growth.    Seipp added the federal government should make "furthercourageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of theGerman economy and to increase its flexibility." Reuter&#3;

This is now mainly represented by a 40 pct stake inEuroPartners Securities Corp, New York, owned along with otherEuropean banks in a consortium.    It would also be a further step in Commerzbank's full entryinto global investment banking around the clock.    Seipp also said securities trading activities had beenconsiderably strengthened in London. The founding of CommerzSecurities (Japan) Co. Ltd, which would begin business in thefirst half of 1987, widened the bank's activity in Tokyo.    In 1987 also, Commerzbank planned to open a representativeoffice in Istanbul. Currency trading had begun in the LosAngeles branch, he added.    At home, Commerzbank would probably bring the automotivesupply group Boge and clothing manufacturer Ahlers to a stockexchange flotation in the first half of this year.    But the placement of shares in the print communicationstechnology group &lt;Linotype GmbH>, to be bought from AlliedSignal Inc &lt;ALD.N> would likely come later since several partsof the business had to be consolidated first.

reut2-011.sgm, THAI STOCKS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE RISING, Thai stocks have broken all expectationsand brokers and securities analysts said the nine-month bullmarket on the Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) should lastthrough 1987.    Most had earlier dismissed a forecast by a local newspaperlast December that the SET Index would rise 50 points to 250 bymid-1987. They said the figure is now within easy reach.    The index, an average of the 93 registered stocks listed onthe market, gained 9.7 pct this month to finish the firstquarter at 228.97.    The index has gained 74 pct since last July after declinesof two pct in the first half of 1986 and five pct in 1985.    Yothin Aree, assistant managing director of Bangkok FirstInvestment and Trust Ltd (BFIT) echoed most analysts in sayingthat, barring dramatic increases in oil prices and worldinterest rates, the market will sustain its rally for the restof the year, punctuated by periodic corrections.    Securities analysts said stocks are the best investmentbecause of excess liquidity, which has forced interest rates to10-year lows. Bankers expect deposit rates, which have fallensix times since January 1986, to stabilise this year.    Central bank governor Kamchorn Sathirakul told commercialbanks last week they should spur loan demand by cutting lendingrates without a matching reduction in deposit rates.    SET statistics show daily trading in listed corporatestocks and government bonds averaged 217 mln baht during thefirst quarter, about 4.5 times higher than a year ago.    Robert Chan, deputy managing director of Wardley ThailandLtd, said foreign interest in Thai equities is strong and a fewJapanese fund managers recently approached him for the firsttime to seek advice on investing in the market.    Wardley Thailand, affiliated with The Hongkong and ShanghaiBanking Corp, handles stocks acquired by many foreign fundmanagers investing in SET.    "We thought six months ago that Thai stocks might have beenoverpriced after a significant 23.5 pct rise of the SET Indexduring the third quarter," Chan said, adding it has since gained41 pct.    He forecast the index could advance 30 to 40 points more byyear-end given the improving Thai economy, foreign interest inThai stocks and SET's average 12 pct price/earnings ratio,which is relatively low by world standards.    Foreign investment accounted for 1.22 billion baht, or 7.8pct of total turnover, in the January/February period, up from347 mln baht, or 5.8 pct, for the whole first quarter of 1986.    Foreigners can invest in the market directly, or throughthe Bangkok Fund or Thailand Fund, unit trusts set up as aportfolio investment vehicles for foreigners.    Bangkok Fund was set up by Merrill Lynch Capital Marketsand Cazenove and Co in 1985, while the Thailand Fund was set uplast December by Vickers da Costa International Ltd, MorganStanley and Co Inc, Banque Internationale a Luxembourg, BIL(Asia) Ltd and the World Bank's International Finance Corp.    Each trust is capitalised at 30 mln dlrs and has investedmore than 70 pct of its funds in equities.    Brokers said demand for Thai stocks has strengthenedcriticism the market, with 2.9 billion dlrs capitalisation, istoo small and its trading narrowly based.    Although an average 50 issues are now traded a session,against 30 a year ago, most foreign fund managers focus on lessthan 10 easily tradeable blue chips. Yothin said investors donot seem interested in smaller or speculative issues.    Long-term investment in SET is also restricted by lawslimiting foreign-held equity in most listed companies.    Foreign equity is limited to a maximum 25 pct in banks andis also the self-imposed limit in popular Siam Cement. Mostother businesses have a 49 pct limit.    SET officials said foreign investment in blue chips hasreached a limit and the barrier will likely slow investment asfund managers are reluctant to buy smaller issues.    SET President Maruay Phadungsith said his priority is tolist more stocks this year and is waiting for governmentapproval to launch a second trading board, where lessdiversified companies with short track records can be listed.    SET hopes to list 10 new issues this year against only onein 1986.    SET officials added state enterprises that have delayedplans to go public are missing a golden opportunity to attractcapital through the exchange as their shares would be popular.    A plan for state-owned Thai Airways International Ltd andBangchak Petroleum Co Ltd to go public this year appears lesscertain because of opposition from their administrations.    The privatisation of Krung Thai Bank Ltd has also been putin doubt by a Finance Ministry decision this month to merge itwith ailing government-owned Sayam Bank Ltd. REUTER&#3;
reut2-011.sgm, H.K. INVESTORS UNLOAD HOLDINGS AFTER STOCK ISSUES, Investors are unloading holdings ofHong Kong stocks following a spate of new share issues byleading local firms, analysts said.    The Hang Seng index fell 61.07 to 2,713.81 yesterday onspeculation that Hutchison Whampoa Ltd planned a bonus issue ofnew "B" shares.    After yesterday's market close Hutchison and its parentCheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd both announced one-for-two bonusissues of "B" shares. The news sent the index down 63.51 pointsto 2,650.30 in today's morning session.    The Cheung Kong companies' issues  followed JardineMatheson Holdings Ltd's announcement on Friday of afour-for-one bonus issue of new "B" shares.    There is also market speculation that Evergo IndustrialEnterprise Ltd will make a similar move, following a requestfor suspension in share trading by the firm today.    Analysts said these new issues will have an adverse impacton trading.    James Miller-Day, director of County Securities Asia Ltd,said: "I don't like the concept of "B" shares because it willcreate inequality among equities."    He said the issue of "B" shares could create a conflict ofinterest with holders of other classes of shares, noting most "B"shares are issued at a par value equivalent to one-tenth of the"A" shares, but enjoy similar voting rights.    Other analysts said the new issues also renewed concernover local corporate attitudes towards political changes inHong Kong after the British colony reverts to China in 1997.    Controlling shareholders can maintain control of localfirms by issuing cheaper shares, with much of the new stockbeing distributed to themselves, analysts said.    Those shareholders can reduce their investment exposurehere by selling some of their "A" shares and using the funds fornew investment, possibly overseas.    An analyst at a major brokerage house said Li Ka-shing,chairman of both Cheung Kong and Hutchison, might be planningto fund future expansion by switching "A" shares for "B" shares.    Other analysts noted that the Cheung Kong group has alreadytaken a major stake in Husky Oil Ltd of Canada and a minorityshare in Pearson Plc of Britain.    Hutchison has begun a major project to expand berthingfacilities at its Hong Kong International Terminal Ltd andCheung Kong will bid for a big land reclamation development atHong Kong harbour.    The analysts said timing of the new issues was wrongbecause the local market had already been hit by declines onWall Street and London since the beginning of the week.    "(The issues) came at a time when world stock markets arereeling from tensions between the U.S. And Japan over theirtrade relations," said Barry Yates, director of Hoare GovettAsia Ltd.    Jardine Matheson's shares enjoyed a brief rally after theannouncement of the new issue, though they have lost 2.50 H.K.Dlrs since last Friday to stand at 22.30 dlrs today.    Cheung Kong was down two dlrs from yesterday's close at41.25 dlrs and Hutchison fell 3.25 dlrs to 49.75 dlrs. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, AUSTRALIA STOCK EXCHANGES ENTER NEW ERA, The Australian Stock Exchange Ltd (ASX)today took up the responsibility for administering a newcoordinated market made up of Australia's six former exchanges,now operating as subsidiary trading floors.    At the same time, rules prohibiting corporations andnon-stock-exchange members from holding more than 50 pct ofAustralia's 101 brokerage firms were abolished, leaving brokersexposed to greater deregulation.    Industry sources said the moves will smooth the changeoverto screen-based trading and give the equities market one voice.    Westpac Banking Corp &lt;WSTP.S> was one of the first to takeadvantage of the changes by announcing today it would doubleits stake in the Sydney firm &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd> to 100 pct.    Brokers have been introduced to creeping deregulation overthe past three years after legislation passed in 1984 to endrestrictive trade practices forced the traditional partnershipsto open themselves at first to partial ownership by outsideinstitutions, and eventually to full ownership.    The phase-in period has ended, and several major banks andoffshore financial institutions are investigating taking largerstakes in Australian broking houses, industry sources said.    Though deregulation was all but forced on brokers, most nowacknowledge that the influx of capital and contacts fromnon-member shareholders has benefited the industry, they said.    "Deregulation has brought an infusion of additional capitaland a broader base of products," ASX chairman Ian Roach toldReuters.    Roach said fears that major bank shareholders would imposea restrictive and conservative "bank culture" on the dynamicsharebroking industry were unfounded.    "So far the banks have been mindful of the importance ofpreserving the entrepreneurial aspect of sharebroking," he said.    But some brokers said others are sceptical and expect thatthe expiration of "golden handcuff" pacts, which tied partners totheir firms for a period after incorporation, could cause amassive talent drain.    Several leading brokers have already announced plans toleave their firms and establish new private client businesses,while others plan public floats.    While bank shareholders have enjoyed dabbling in brokingduring Australia's record two-and-a-half year bull run, theycould find themselves without the expertise they need duringmore difficult times, some brokers said.    Rene Rivkin, head of Sydney brokerage house &lt;Rivkin JamesCapel Ltd>, said many brokers will resist anything thatrestricts their individuality and entrepreneurial spirit, andthis could leave new entrants into the business short-staffed.    "If I were a bank I'm not sure I would have gone intobroking.... What's going to happen when a lot of these goldenhandcuffs come to an end?" Rivkin said.    "Only then will the banks know what they've got," he said.    Rivkin's firm is 50 pct owned by Hongkong and ShanghaiBanking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK> unit &lt;Wardley Australia Ltd> and plans apublic float of between 25 and 30 pct.    "My relationship with the Hong Kong bank is wonderful. Theyleave me alone and give me all the support I need.... Maybe ifwe weren't doing so well there wouldn't be that support, butthat hasn't happened," he said.    Other firms might not be so lucky, he said, and they couldfind it difficult to preserve their independence when the bullmarket ends.    In the last two years, the value of the Australiansharemarket has leapt 118 pct with turnover value up 152 pct to31.24 billion dlrs in the year to June 30, 1986.    That growth put existing trading systems and clearinghouses under pressure, and unification of the six sovereignexchanges should accelerate the development of screen-basedtrading and a single clearing house, industry sources said.    From July this year 30 leading stocks will be traded in apilot of the ASX's screen trading system which, depending onits reception by brokers, is expected to replace trading floorsover the next four years, industry sources said.

reut2-011.sgm, TAIWAN SEES SHARP DECLINE IN SHIPBREAKING, Taiwan's shipbreaking industry isexpected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986because of keener competition from South Korea and China, therising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products,industry sources said.    Last year, Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons (ldt),up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985, Lin Chung-jung, a TaiwanShipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman, toldReuters.    China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year whileSouth Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt, he said.    Yao Liu, president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co, a leadingshipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung, told Reuters, "Weexpect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expecteddecline in our steel product exports."    Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline inscrapping operations this year due to falling demand from theU.S., Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel.    Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steelproduct exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first halfof 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986, aTaiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.    Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan's steelexports are more expensive than South Korea's and China's.    The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct againstthe U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers andeconomists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar bythe end of the year from 34.23 today, Yao said.    In comparison, the won rose by about five pct and yuanremained stable during the same period, he added.    "We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland Chinabecause foreign importers have switched their purchases," hesaid.    Taiwan's steel exports to the U.S., Japan and SoutheastAsia slipped to 148,000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987from about 220,000 tonnes a year earlier, the Taiwan Steel andIron Association official said.

A minor tax payment period on behalfof customers mid-month, the long Easter weekend and pensionpayments were unlikely to tighten rates significantly.    Next Wednesday, 14.9 billion marks are leaving the systemon the expiry of a securities repurchase pact. But dealers saidthey expected the Bundesbank to fully replace the outflow witha new tender at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct.    Commerzbank AG's management board chairman Walter Seippcalled on the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates to protectthe mark through bringing the allocation rate for securitiesrepurchase agreements down.    But dealers said the Bundesbank was unlikely to ease creditpolicies at the moment. There was little domestic and foreignpressure for lower rates and no signs of a change.

reut2-011.sgm, TURKISH BANKS ANNOUNCE HIGHER PROFITS FOR 1986, Turkey's banks are reporting a strongrecovery in 1986 profits, but a government drive to liberalisecapital markets poses new challenges to a banking industryseeking to broaden its earnings base.    A dozen of Turkey's 55 banks have announced higher 1986profits so far, a trend bankers in the financial capital ofIstanbul expect to be reflected through most of the industry.    But while Ankara's policy of liberalising markets offersnew opportunites to expand operations, some bankers see dangersattached to a related drive to push down Turkish interestrates.    Bankers said the government's policy of fostering lowerinterest rates could lead to a consumer boom and reigniteinflation, currently running at about 30 pct. They worry thatthis could further reduce the industry's shrinking depositbase.    This has given added urgency to bank moves to build uptheir capital market operations as Turkey's market-orientedPrime Minister Turgut Ozal liberalises the financial system.    Bankers said the 1986 recovery in earnings stemmed partlyfrom foreign exchange operations and trade finance. But agrowing volume of trading in government securities is now alsoa major source of revenue for banks.    Bankers said the proportion of bank profits generated fromthe traditional financing of commerce and industry is falling,and some have even been making a loss on these operations.    The major challenge to bank profits in Turkey came in 1980when the government, faced with its worst financial crisis in50 years, raised domestic interest rates sharply to fight aninflation rate of over 100 pct and launched an export drive.    Deniz Gokce, associate professor of economics at theBosphorus University, told Reuters that banks were forced topay depositors real interest rates for the first time andprofits started to fall. Previously, rates had been belowinflation.    Turkey's domestic banks also partly missed out on theexport drive as foreign banks moved into Istanbul and reapedthe benefits of trade finance with their added expertise. Thenumber of foreign banks has risen to 16 from just two in 1981.    Although local banks tried to follow suit, Turkey's exportsdeclined last year to 7.4 billion dlrs from 7.9 billion in 1985and bankers doubt there is enough business to go round.    As a result banks, including a few foreign operations, havestarted moving into capital market operations to broaden theirearnings base and take advantage of the relaunch just over ayear ago of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.    "When we saw that there was a demand and supply of moneyoutside the banking system, we could not envisage ourselvesexcluded from these transactions," said Osman Erk, deputygeneral manager of the private bank Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi AS.    The number of banks active at the exchange, mainly tradinggovernment securities, went up to 28 this year from 23 when themarket was revived in December 1985.    Liberalisation went one step further last week whenparliament passed a law encouraging companies to go public.Last month, Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi launched the country's firstcommercial paper programme, for a joint-venture chemical firm.    Medium-sized private Pamukbank AS announced a strongrecovery in 1986 pre-tax profit to 12.9 billion lira from 603mln in 1985, while Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi profits increased to30.6 billion lira from 6.1 billion. Bankers said both benefitedfrom trade finance and increased capital market operations.    Turkey's second biggest bank, the private Turkiye IsBankasi, announced a profit rise to 35 billion from 32.3billion in 1985.    However, bankers said some banks have been "window dressing"their balance sheets to mask non-performing loans which arevariously estimated by bankers at between 20 to 50 pct of theindustry's 9,026 billion lira in total credits.    Non-performing loans began to mount in the early 1980s asindustry failed to cope with higher interest rates and startedto default. Some banks continued to count loans as performing.    "After 1984 all banks started to be more careful in givingcredits, so the non-performing loans is a problem of the periodbetween 1980 to 1984," Erk said.    But the problem of bad loans led to a rescue by three statebanks of medium-sized Turkiye Ogretmenler Bankasi AS earlierthis year when the Treasury, which acts as a watchdog body overbanks, discovered that the its assets were to a large extentmade up of non-performing loans.    Some 51 billion lira out of the bank's 69 billion lira loanportfolio was non-performing. But the bank had reported a 1986pre-tax profit of 65 mln lira.    Bankers cited this as a typical example of how balancesheets could hide problems despite a drive by the central bankto standardise accounting.    Gokce said the only solution would be for compulsoryauditing by international accounting companies. REUTER&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING, A proposed sales tax on gold transactionscould put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift oftrading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president andTokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a pressconference.    "If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,"he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese wouldbe unable to compete in the international market, he added.    "How can the government really raise taxes if the systemthey impose is prohibitive of generating business?" he said.    The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical tradesexceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yentax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.    The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies tradingmore than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well asthat of jewellery and coins, dealers said.    However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery andcoins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.    Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct goldturnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.    A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banksfell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.    Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of thevolume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.    While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, thevolume of trades outside the country, particularly in Londonand Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.    Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly averagejust under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.    Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but thegovernment had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins tocommemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealerssaid.    Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanesetrading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreignparticipant.    Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between oneand 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, whilefutures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealerssaid.    "All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyomarket is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the threemajor financial markets in the world ... And in my personalopinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damperon this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,"Hofer said.    "I don't think it fits the philosophy of aninternationalising market," he added.    Officials of several major Japanese trading houses,attending the press conference, said they supported CreditSuisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax. REUTER&#3;
reut2-011.sgm, INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE, The Indian Finance Ministry'sannouncement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation'sinterest rate structure, will benefit industry and agricultureby providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.    The changes, effective today, included reducing commercialbank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pctby one percentage point.    New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, alsoinclude a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, ondeposits of two years or more but less than five.    Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pctinterest have been abolished.    Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect thegovernment's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and helpimprove world competitiveness of Indian goods.    There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank depositsby long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will createthe flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equityshares or short-term bank deposits, they said.    A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs dueto lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.    Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closingof 1,012.50 rupees.    A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic nowto buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because theFinance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.

reut2-011.sgm, MALAYSIA DECLINES TO STATE POSITION ON COCOA PACT, Government officials in Malaysia, amajor cocoa producer, have declined to say whether it will jointhe International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) for which buffer stockrules were agreed in London last week.    Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in Januarythe cabinet would decide on Malaysia's participation, but sofar a decision has not been announced. The government is saidto be in favour of joining the pact, but local cocoa growersand traders told Reuters they are against the idea becausecertain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage.    Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer. Thegovernment feels that the pact, through its buffer stockmechanism, can help stabilise prices in a market which islabouring under surpluses, officials said.    But growers and traders are concerned Malaysia'sparticipation in the pact will require them to pay a levy forexports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA.    They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne atcurrent prices and said they are not prepared to accept itbecause a big portion of Malaysia's cocoa exports, officiallyestimated at 112,000 tonnes in 1986, goes to non-members.    Most growers and traders added they are also against abuffer stock measure under the agreement which requireswithholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump.    Malaysia, which produced 117,000 tonnes of cocoa last year,might be forced to withhold up to 70,000 tonnes worth some 30mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term, and thismight affect their economic viability, they said.    "The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and itwill be a real messy business for the government and the tradeif it ever occurs," an industry source said.    The growers and traders also said that under new bufferstock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is nota member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is alsoallowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile.    Under the new rules purchases from non-members, such asMalaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock.    Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers tojoin the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it neednot rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countriesto join the agreement even at a later date.

Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two daysof heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market byannouncing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.    Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar- the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on thenews.    Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in theEuromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.    Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fearsof a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, buteconomists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whosepolicy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets thisweek, is already tightening its grip on credit.

O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel ofthe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco hadblocked the merger until a dispute over union representationhad been settled by arbitration.    A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay ofthe injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,to go through as planned later today.    The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Eachof the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over aparticular regional Appellate circuit and has the power toprovisionally overturn its rulings without comment.    The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials ofAtlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the mergerfor months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanesbelonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.    "Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,"Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution latelast night. "There was really very little that remained to bedone."    The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had beenfiled in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air TransportEmployees union sought to force Western's management to fulfilla promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger tookplace.    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not beenforced in a takeover by a larger company.    After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officialslast night spread the word by telephone that Western employeesshould report for work today in their old uniforms, not in newDelta outfits.    Delta announced last September that it was purchasingWestern. The merger took place in December, and Western hasbeen operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Westernname was to have disappeared at midnight last night.    At issue is whether the Western unions would continue torepresent Western employees after the integration of the twoairlines.    While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees areunionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.    Delta had maintained that the three unions having contractswith Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and theTeamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be"extinguished" after today.

reut2-011.sgm, KENYAN MINISTER FORECASTS ECONOMIC EXPANSION, Kenya's economy will continue to expandthis year and the government will do more to encourageinvestment by foreign firms and the local private sector,Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.    He told a news conference that the government would sooncreate a special bureau to expedite processing of investmentapplications by local and foreign investors.    Praising the role of multinational companies and localentrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised tomaintain a close working contact with the private sector.    The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in1985, Ouko said.    This was owing to high prices for the country's coffeeexports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes,he added.    "Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987," theplanning minister said.    "High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, tradeliberalisation and disciplined financial management areexpected to increase output in the manufacturing sector," hesaid.    Agriculture would expand significantly if favourableweather continued and farmers responded to producer price risesannounced in February, the minister added.    Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of thelong rainy season, which is due to start about now.    Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash cropsincreased during the second half of last year.    Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenyarose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,he said.    Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for itscontribution to the economy and promised to improve governmentcooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contactwith them.    "I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for itscontribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it tomaintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sectorgrew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the sameperiod the previous year," he said.    Ouko said the "one stop" bureau was intended to stimulateinvestment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involvedin processing applications.    The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyaneconomy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflationfalling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier.    This was owing to higher agricultural production and theKenyan shilling's relative strength against other majorcurrencies, the report said.    The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlrlast year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The halfyearly report said exports increased about 30 pct inJuly-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct duringthe period.    This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period,compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit inthe second half of 1985, it said.

He declinedcomment on local press reports which said the ministry wouldback a plan aimed at cooling British anger on the issue.    The press reports said Fumio Watanabe, head of theFederation of Economic Organisations, would propose thatBritain's Cable and Wireless Plc be given a five pct stake in atelecommunications firm and a seat on the board.    Watanabe was unavailable for comment. He has the tacitbacking of the government in his efforts to merge twotelecommunications companies into one competitor to KokusaiDenwa Denshin (KDD), which has a monopoly on internationaltelephone services here, industry analysts said.    In London yesterday, a Cable and Wireless spokesman saidthe latest reported proposals are unacceptable.    Cable and Wireless has a 20 pct stake in one of the twocompanies involved in the mooted merger.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has personallytaken up the company's cause, charging that Japan isdiscriminating against foreigners.    The United States also has vented its anger at what it seesas Japanese attempts to limit foreign participation.

reut2-011.sgm, HOG REPORT SHOWS MORE HOGS ON FARMS, The USDA quarterly hogs and pig reportyesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last yearas profitability resulting from low grain prices encouragedproducers to step up production, analysts said.    Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago MercantileExchange floor traders that the report will be viewed asbearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharplylower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines innearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.    University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,"Thereport shows that hog producers have responded to a verydesirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10months."    Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futuresprices are above producers' break even points. Even if futuresfell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could stilllock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavyselling pressure today.    "We have not had a period of profitability of thismagnitude since last summer," Levitt said. "In fact, hogoperations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have beenso profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get backon their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hogoperation alone."    Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also wasnegative, in that some lead time was anticipated before theslaughter increased from the previous year.    We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but wedidn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-statespring report, Levitt added.    High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn thatcould be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increasedprofits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations toincrease production starting late last year.    Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hogherd resulted from a revision of the December report andwithout the revision, the March report might have been veryclose to average expectations.    Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a majorupward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breedingherd in the December 1 report. So the December report was morebearish than initially indicated.    But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the reportto be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distantcontracts are already at a sharp discount to cash becausetraders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.    Discounts in the October and December contracts take intoconsideration a six to seven pct increase in March/Mayfarrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1report, Fuller said.    Grimes said, "As far as the distant months are concerned,if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take atremendous discount in price for each percent increase for usto push down to the prices that the current futures show forthe July and August period."    Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted thatdistant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower thanthey were last summer.    "If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrsduring July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaperthis year because we have six pct more numbers," he said. Reuter&#3;

He told a news conference that the government would sooncreate a special bureau to expedite processing of investmentapplications by local and foreign investors.    Praising the role of multinational companies and localentrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised tomaintain a close working contact with the private sector.    The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in1985, Ouko said. This was owing to high prices for thecountry's coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation andrising real incomes, he added.    "Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987," theplanning minister said.    Agriculture would expand significantly if favourableweather continued and farmers responded to producer price risesannounced in February, the minister added.    Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of thelong rainy season, which is due to start about now.

reut2-011.sgm, MILLER SAYS REAGAN OPPOSES U.S. EXCISE TAX HIKES, Office of Management and Budgetdirector James Miller said President Reagan opposes increasesin the federal excise taxes on gas, cigarettes or alcohol tohelp reduce the federal budget deficit.    In an address before a group of House Republicans, Millerreiterated Reagan's opposition to an oil import duty. "I thinkalso he would opose an increase in the gas tax."    He said there was no reason to think Reagan had changed hisopposition to a cigarette tax hike. "In the case of thecigarette tax, we have no evidence the appropriate tax ishigher than now, and the same on wine and spirits."    Miller urged the Republicans to hold firm against a taxhike to reduce the estimated 174 billion dlr deficit for the1988 financial year.    House Democratic budget writers are expected to recommendan 18 to 20 billion dlr revenue increase as part of the 1988budget. However, the composition of the taxes would be left tothe tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee to decide.    Reagan's 1988 budget proposed 22 billion in revenueincreases from sales of federal assets such as the Amtrakrailroad, higher federal fees for services and largerindividual payments for social programs.    "It's so essential to us to hold on that point of no taxincrease," Miller said.    He added that House Speaker Jim Wright's proposal to set anew tax on security transactions was "a nonstarter" with theWhite House. The tax would be a tax on capital which woulddiscourage all but the most profitable short-term transactionsand could lead to creation of a duty-free market abroad.    "Control spending, get the deficit down and oppose any taxincrease," Miller urged the Republicans.    Congress has set 108 billion dlrs as its deficit target for1988. Reuter&#3;

reut2-011.sgm, U.S. SENATOR HITS PROPOSED FARM BUDGET CUTS, U.S. Senate Agriculture Committeechairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said it would be impossible tocut two billion dlrs from the fiscal 1988 agriculture budget asproposed by Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles(D-Fla.)    "I don't know how we could possibly absorb two billion dlrsof cuts without enormous disruptions," Leahy told the NationalCattlemen's Association.    Chiles has proposed making unspecified policy changes thatwould trim two billion dlrs from farm income and price supportprograms in the fiscal year beginning next October.    Leahy said such cuts would be impossible, that one billiondlrs in cuts would be "darn near impossible" and that a spendingfreeze would be difficult.    Leahy said Congress would have to provide "some money" forthe Farm Credit System, but that a "wholesale bailout" would notbe forthcoming.    "We may need changes in (the system's) procedures but wewill not let the system go belly up or simply become anotherbank," he said.    A task force composed of Leahy and Sens. David Boren(D-Okla.), Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.)is working on a proposal for assisting the Farm Credit Systemthat Leahy said should be ready shortly after Congress's Easterrecess, set for April 13 through 20.    Leahy said his panel would consider changes in the wheatand feedgrains programs this year, including a proposal toestablish mandatory production controls.    However, he said a bill offered by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) would probably not passCongress as presently written.    A bill to provide emergency disaster assistance tomidwestern grain producers, already passed by the House, maynot be considered by the Senate for another 10 days becausemembers have lined up as many as two dozen amendments costingbillions of dollars, he said.
