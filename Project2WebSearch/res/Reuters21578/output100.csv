But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fellsharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ampledistillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.    Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.    For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values weremostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts.

reut2-016.sgm, TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY, Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe floating exchange rate system has not been as effective ashad been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalancesfrom emerging in the global economy.    In remarks before the afternoon session of theInternational Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said hewas not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.    "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need something to giveit more stability and to keep it headed in the right directionwhen the wind shifts."    He said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" butadded that structural indicators can help focus attention onsome policies.    Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to move beyondmacroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators thatcan help focus attention on some of the policies of specificrelevance to the imbalances we face today."    The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be givena more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- ArticleIV consultations -- that the Fund performs.    Baker also told the policy making group that it was timefor the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMFsurveillance more relevant to national policymakers and thepublic.    "In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMFappraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use offollow-up reports on country actions to implement IMFrecommendations, and greater use of special consultationprocedures," he said.    Baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for movingbeyond rhetoric to action."    He said they provide "more structure to the system, andinduce more discipline and peer pressure into the process ofpolicy coordination."    He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to bereviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.    "This should be matter of priority for the executive board,"he said.    Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternativemedium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help usfocus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, byidentifying options for addressing them and analyzing theimplications of these options."    He said also that further work should be done on findingpaths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.    "If we are to take effective remedial action when there aresignificant deviations from an intended course, then we musthave more definitive ways of indentifying the right course forkey variables," he said.

reut2-016.sgm, U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS, Commodities from gold to grains tocotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as lossesin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears ofinflation and economic instability.    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York.    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets.    "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "Ifthey do, it's not evident."    "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be.    "One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.    "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening," he said.    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick.    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains.    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand.    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher.    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They saidhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals. Reuter&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, EC WARNS AGAINST PASSAGE OF TEXTILE BILL, The European Community has toldCongress that if textile legislation injuring EC interests isapproved, there was no doubt the community would retaliateagainst U.S. exports.    Roy Denmam, head of the EC delegation here, issued thewarning in a letter to Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of theFinance Committee. A copy of the letter was provided Reuters.    Denmam told Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, that if the textilelegislation passed on its own or was included in an omnibustrade bill and injured EC interests, "there should be no doubtthat the EC will retaliate against the United States."    He added that "at a time when U.S. textile exports to the ECare growing rapidly, one result of such retaliation would be asubstantial reduction of U.S. exports and jobs."    The textile legislation, backed strongly by the industry,hard hit by imports, and by senators from textile-producingstates would impose new tough global quotas on textile importsand for the first time include Europe in the quotas.    Reagan Administration officials have also opposed thetextile legislation, saying that if it passed it would likelyprompt a presidential veto.    Denman made his comments on the textile issue in a generalassessment of the Senate trade bill, titled S.490.    He said he was concerned about provisions in the Senatebill that would limit, if not eliminate, the president'sdiscretion if retaliating against nations for keeping theirhome markets closed to foreign goods.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has also opposedthose provisions, arguing that presidential flexibility wasneeded in order to be able to negotiate with countries to opentheir markets, with retaliation being retained as a final, butdiscretionary, weapon.    The pending overall trade legislation would force theAdministration to consult often with Congress and seek itsapproval during step-by-step GATT negotiations.    He said "enactment of S. 490 would reduce the confidence ofother governments in America's commitment to multinationaltrade."    Summing up the senate legislation, Denman said "a number ofprovisions of that bil may achieve the opposite of what isintended and lead to dangerous consequences for the world andthe U.S. economy."

reut2-016.sgm, SEMICONDUCTOR BOOK TO BILL RATIO AT 1.21 PCT, The Semiconductor IndustryAssociation put the three-month average book-to-bill ratio at1.21, which was above analysts' expectations and reflects thesixth straight increase in this indicator of computer industryactivity.    Average booking in the three month period ended in Marchtotaled 910.8 mln dlrs, up 15.6 pct from a month ago and thehighest bookings since September, 1984. March billings, orcomputer chip sales in the month, totaled 912.1 mln dlrs, up34.6 pct from a month ago, the association said. The threemonth average billings totaled 751.3 mln dlrs, up 6.5 pct.    March billings were the strongest recorded since November,1984, the association said. The book to bill ratio, at 1.21,was the highest since May, 1984, it noted.    Preliminary total solid state shipments for the firstquarter of 1987 totaled 2.25 billion dlrs, up 4.9 pct from lastquarter and up 15.9 pct from last year's first quarter.    Semiconductor Industry Association President AndrewProcassini said the rise in the book to bill was due to asubstantial increase in U.S. bookings during March.    "We believe that the bookings increase reflects growingconfidence by electronic equipment manufacturers that someend-equipment market segments have improved substantiallyduring the first quarter," Procassini said in a statement.    The association also revised its book-to-bill ratioestimate for the three months ended in February to 1.12, from1.13 earlier. It further revised the January book-to-billfigure to 1.09 from 1.12 estimated earlier.    The three-month average book-to-bill ratio of 1.21 forMarch means for every 100 dlrs worth of product shipped,computer chip maker received 121 dlrs in new orders.    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc analyst Michael Gumport saidassociation numbers indicate March orders were up 20 pct abovethe normal seasonal level.    The association does not break out March orders from itsthree-month average, which it put at 910.8 mln dlrs.    Gumport noted the three-month average bookings were wellabove the 800-865 mln dlrs anticipated by the industry.    He said semiconductor stock could rise five to ten pct onthe stock market open tomorrow, due to the positive numbers.    "Skeptics are going to have to have some pretty strongreasons not to like this group (of stocks)," Gumport said.    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Michael Kubiak said the ratioindicates March orders at about one billion dlrs, which wouldbe the highest monthly order rate since April, 1984.    He predicted at least a five pct rise in semiconductorstocks on the open, and said the stock group could soar as highas 15 pct during the session.    "One month does not a boom-time make, but this is very goodnews," he said.    Kubiak attributed the stong semiconductor orders tostrength in the personal computer market, inventory restockingand strong buying by distributors.    Purchasing managers had been keeping computer chipinventories low, due to the overcapacity in the industry andthe slow growth of the economy in general, analysts noted.    The semiconductor industry has been in a slump for the pastthree years.    The analysts said the March order and sales numbers are thestrongest evidence yet that the trend may be turning.    Nevertheless, they do not expect the Administration toretreat from proposed sanctions against Japanese chip makers.    They added, however, if the industry continues to improve,it could mean the sanctions will be short term.    Jack Beedle, President of In-Stat, an electronics industryresearch firm, called the March numbers "excellent", but alsocautioned against excessive optimism.    "I still believe caution should be the word, rather thaneuphoria," said Beedle, adding that he has yet to see strongindications from the general economy or the computer industrythat support a solid, long-term recovery.    Beedle said while he thinks the semiconductor industry willhave a very good second quarter, he still thinks positiveshifts in exports and industrial production are needed tosustain a recovery.

The warning involving Reye's Syndrome has since beenrequired on aspirin products under a Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) directive of one year ago, and now appearson the labels of aspirin and aspirin-containing products.    The industry under government coaxing began voluntarilyprinting warning labels in mid-1985.       But in an editorial in this week's Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, Dr Edward Mortimer of CaseWestern Reserve University in Cleveland said some aspirinmanufacturers misled physicians and acted irresponsibly inopposing the warning for several years before then.    Mortimer's criticism was prompted by a new government studypublished in the same issue of the Journal which said it hadfound a "strong association" between aspirin and Reye's Syndrome.

"Our budget is at about the same level as it was last yearand I think it is the right amount," said Murray who was intown for ceremonies celebrating the consolidation of Mobil'sdomestic exploration and production operations into a new,locally-based subsidiary.     Last year, Mobil spent a total of 2.13 billion dlrs onexploration and production, 341 mln dlrs in the United Statesand 1.79 billion overseas.     Murray said the new subsidiary, Mobil Exploration andProduction U.S. Inc., was not created as "part of any costsaving effort" but instead to "increase our efficiency andability to stay ahead of the pack."     The consolidation will, however, save Mobil about 15 mlndlrs annually once relocation and reorganization costs havebeen absorbed, according to A.F.

Mobil, the nation's second largest oil company, respondedto the collapse of oil prices last year -- from 30 dlrs abarrel at end-1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986 -- bylaying off 5,500 people and cutting its budget in midyear by 27percent, or 1.1 billion dlrs.

His remarks were made to the afternoon session of theInternational Monetary Fund's policy making Interim Committee.    Baker said, "The sense of urgency and willingness tocooperate in support of a larger general interest that helpedto carry us through the difficult crisis period of 1982 and1983 is now less evident."    He said to address this problem, it is important for thecommercial banks to "develop a menu of alternative new money options from which all banks with debt exposure can choose inproviding continuing support for debtor reforms."    He said the "continued implementation of the debt strategymay well rest on their doing so."    Baker also said that growth prospects for the lowest incomecountries remain an issue of "critical concern to the UnitedStates."    He said that he intended to address the problem of poorcountry prospects in greater detail at tomorrow's meeting ofthe joint IMF-World Bank Devlopment Committee.

reut2-016.sgm, ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE, Economists said that they doubt theFederal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despitehigher discount window borrowings in the latest two-weekstatement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.    Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mlndlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.    "One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but itprobably isn't," said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings.    "Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didn't quite make it," saidWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today thatthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs ormore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss inits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewerreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.    The Fed took no market reserve management action lastThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It addedtemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reservesdirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that thetwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged onTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday'sovernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.    "It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy atthis time," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzisaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interestrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weakeconomies in the United States and abroad and add to thefinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders.    "Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the lateststatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollartumbled," said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a newstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday'sWashington meetings of international monetary officials failedto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing inWednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view thatthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge tradeimbalance between the United States and Japan.    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming forsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly averageFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about wherethe rate has been since early November.    "I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighterpolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect," said Sullivan ofDean Witter.    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has justnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct fromsix to 6.10 pct previously. Reuter&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, U.S. THRIFT OFFICIAL URGES MORE LENDER INSURANCE, The Administration's 15 billion dlrplan to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorporation is needed to ensure the future profitablity of theU.S. thrift industry, according to a top industry regulator.    "Today thrifts in overwhelming numbers are profitable," Shannon Fairbanks, executive chief of staff of the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board told a thrift industry conference.    "But every thrift is paying a market tax for the inabliityof regulators to deal with problems carried forward from thepast," she said, referring to the premium that thrifts have topay in the marketplace to entice deposits away from banks.    "The industry wants to see a five billion dlr plan passednow, and then to wait and see what happens," Fairbanks said."They're saying, 'we don't want to pay more right away.' Theargument is that it's a drain on the industry."    "But the dollars paid out can be recaptured in thereduction in the market tax differential," she said. "The costof recapitalization to the industry would be recaptured inbottom line profitability."    Fairbanks said that the public's confidence in thriftinstititutions eroded with the financial difficulties ofsavings and loan associations in Ohio and Maryland in 1985.    As thrift institutions in economically distressed areaslike Texas have continued to fall on hard times, this hasincreased depositors' demand for a higher premium on depositsin savings and loans compared with premiums paid on deposits incommercial banks, she said.    Before 1983, thrift institutions paid a 25 basis pointyield differential on savings deposits over that offered bycommercial banks as mandated by U.S. financial regulations.    With the elimination in 1983 of regulations that had drawnstrict lines between savings and loans and commercial banks,the gap widened to as much as 50 to 75 basis points as warydepositors demanded a higher premium to place their funds inthrift institutions, Fairbanks said.    "The market tax paid by today's thrift industry is the mostsignificant impediment to future profits," she said.    Depositor confidence is also eroded by the existence ofthrifts that are failing but manage to stay in business bypaying deposit rates well above prevailing market rates.    Presently, the FHLBB cannot afford to close failinginstitiutions "because we can't afford it with the currentFSLIC fund," she said.    Fairbanks estimated that the high market tax differentialpaid by thrifts will drop by at least 10 to 20 basis pointswith an adequate recapitalization of FSLIC because it will helprestore this lost confidence.

reut2-016.sgm, U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE, Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financialmarkets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar'swake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology thatis likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's declineas the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fellsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.    But that confidence is now cracking as the financialmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker'soften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.    "Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollarfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it," saidDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washingtonfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have acredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, shortof further depreciation of the dollar.    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amidworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scareaway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spikein interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average downby 33 points to 2339.    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called themarkets' instability frightening. He believes economicfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that "onceyou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."    "There's a stark possibility that you could get adestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest ratesand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic."    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economicsin Washington, has been warning for a long time that thecontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.    "We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... Butthe agony may be fairly drawn out," Marris told Reuters.    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later thisyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that itwould take very little to touch off what he calls the secondphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in thedollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop onMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent withhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets arenot affected until a currency is in the final stages of itsdecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latestweakness was the loss of credibility that central bankssuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from fallingbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set aspart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss ofconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announcedplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronicimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.    Many economists believe that long-run stability will notreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap isaddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in themassive budget deficit.    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and ofcentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have nochoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.    "The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is asubstantial increase in the discount rate and a correspondingcut abroad, at least by Japan," said Lanston's Jones.    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interestrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden forAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others.    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs andCo, scoffed at the notion. "It's ridiculous to think the FederalReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weakagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollarweakness," he said.    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress beingmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.    "We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in thebudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobodycares," he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69will have been greater.    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse andthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly thata further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. "Put onyour helmets," Giordano said. REUTER&#3;

They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japanduring the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lowerits discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feelany need for a cut at all.    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reportersearlier today that some countries - those with strongcurrencies - might have to cut interest rates.    The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon tocall the G-7 pact a failure.    The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar'srenewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked byremarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that thedollar's fall had been orderly.    They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker'scomments because he was referring to the dollar's fall sincethe Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,not the currency's recent movements.    They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seizeon anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way orthe other.    The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting moreweight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging marketstability than on other currencies.    Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangersthat would arise from a further dollar fall because it wouldreduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting theU.S. And world economies, they said.    In February and in March of this year, Japanese investorsreduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sourcessaid.    Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view aboutcurrency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.    This is because the overall foreign exchange market is atriangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen anddollar/European currencies.    At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries didnot want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they didnot object to the yen strengthening, they said. REUTER&#3;

Languetin said meetings of the Group of 10 and the IMFInterim Committee today reached a consensus that a reschedulinglike that of Mexico's debt must be the last of its kind. TheMexico rescheduling has still not been finally resolved sixmonths after it started. Various members suggested otheroptions to break the deadlock between debtor countries andtheir creditors, he said.    Languetin said no recommendations were agreed, but helisted some of the suggestions.    One involved individual banking systems each resolving theproblem of small banks which refused to participate inreschedulings. It was this problem that had preventedcompletion of the Mexican rescheduling, he said.    Debt-equity swaps could be expanded, as could 'on-lending',which some banks had proposed for Argentine debt. 'On-lending'allows banks to select customers for rescheduled amounts.    Small banks which did not wish to reschedule might beforced to sign "exit bonds," prohibiting them from lending tothat country again, he said.

A hearing is scheduled Monday on Texaco's motion to reducethe amount of bond required by Texas state law to secure a 1985judgment in favour of Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> in a dispute over theacquisition of Getty Oil.    Pennzoil today said it proposed to the court that Texacosecure its bond with assets valued at about 50 pct of the bond.    It said this would not force Texaco into bankruptcy.    Richard Brinkman, Texaco's chief financial officer, said ina newly filed affidavit that the company was willing to use its65 mln shares of &lt;Texaco Canada Inc> as collateral for a letterof credit or loan to provide security to Pennzoil.    The Canadian unit's stock, valued at about 1.8 billiondlrs, was returned to Texaco earlier this week after being heldas security by a federal district court in New York whileTexaco awaited a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. Brinkmanestimated that Texaco could borrow no more than one billiondlrs using its Canadian subsidiary stock as collateral for aloan.    Texaco, he said, was unwilling to pledge the stock of itsother foreign subsidiary corporations as security because thestock is not widely traded and its market value was unclear.    Brinkman also said the company had already lost access to afour billion dlr revolving credit line since the initial juryverdict against Texaco.    Texaco had been able to raise working capital by sellingabout 700 mln dlrs in receivables to a group of banks since thejudgment, he said. The banks earlier this week notified Texacothat they would not purchase any additional receivables becauseof the company's uncertain status, Brinkman said.    Four other credit agreements for 1.15 billion dlrs wouldalso be cut off if a judgment of more than four billion dlrs isoutstanding against the company and it is unable to obtain astay, Brinkman said.    "Since the Supreme Court decision on April 6, many othersuppliers to Texaco have notified Texaco that their dealingswith it are under review and a number have demanded cashpayment or terminated their dealings with Texaco," he said.    The Supreme Court overturned a lower federal court decisionto cut Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, saying the issueshould first be considered in Texas courts.

The joint Development Committee, in a communique releasedfollowing day-long discussions, said an improved environmentfor commodities was extremely important to the long-termviability of developing countries.    The committee also criticised the slow-down in lending todebtor nations.    Poorer countries, which rely primarily on raw commoditysales to industrial nations to pay their debts, have beenhighly critical of protectionist agricultural policies in theUnited States, Western Europe and Japan.    "Ministers identified protectionist agricultural policies asa major cause of distortions including depressed commodityprices on world markets, of surplus production and of budgetarydrain," the communique said.    The communique, delayed because of disputes over specificlanguage, was the final statement by the IMF and the bank afterweek-long semi-annual meetings of the two lending agencies.    Earlier, the IMF's powerful Interim Committee added itsvoice to growing criticism of delays by commercial banks oncritically needed loan packages for debt-laden developingcountries.    The committee said it welcomed the exploration of newprocedures and financing techniques that will help mobilise newfinancial support for indebted countries.    On Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, in astatement to the policy-making committee, said commercial banklending to debtor nations last year was disappointing and moreflexibility in loan programs was needed.    "Doubts about financing can clearly undermine the resolve tocarry out needed reforms," Baker said.    The Development Committee also joined in the criticism,noting that there had been a declining flow of capital to thedeveloping countries that "has been particularly significant inthe case of flows from commercial banks."

The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,the company said.    "Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCOregrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar caneafter April 10," the mill warned planters earlier this week.    Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteenmonths ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cookingoil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumerprices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwinghundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.    At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up toreceive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed awarehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound(45-kg) bags of sugar.    "We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.We have no money left to continue operations," Rigaud said.    He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed anadditional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.    Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvaliertwo years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.    He said the government then began importing refined sugarat world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit andthe provisional military-civilian government that replacedDuvalier last year continued the policy.    "But now with all the smuggling even the state can't competewith smuggled Dominican refined sugar," Rigaud said.    HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably abovethe usual minimum wage of three dlrs.    It is generally estimated that every employed Haitiansupports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at aminimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.    Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure.

Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry'sCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list ofproducts included 60 items asked by Washington.    "The move is part of our government efforts to encourageimports from our trading partners, particularly from the UnitedStates," he said.    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinetthat the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cutby between five and 50 pct.    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added.    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island'slargest trading partner.    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts andpressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge tradedeficit with Taipei.    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. Itwidened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.

We can ban firms from certain countriesfrom carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowingthem to carry out other kinds."    "I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made itclear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall usethem."    He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan becameinvolved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gainedmore than anyone else from an open trading relationship.

reut2-016.sgm, UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES, Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)has stopped offering coffee on the international market becauseit is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.    The board suspended offerings last week but because of itsurgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long itcould sustain, the sources added.    Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have beenwaiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has hadtrouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to theKenyan port of Mombasa.    Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis byholding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings fromcoffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.    The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee moneyand President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penaltyfor such delays, it added.    Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was thatcommercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings-- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in thecurrent coffee year, while the government had asked for 100billion.    The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct ofannual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.    The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's exportearnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows islikely to more than offset an expected increase in production.    CMB officials have forecast that because the government hasrestored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda willproduce over three mln bags of coffee in the year endingSeptember 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled byproduction from non-traditional corn farms which diversifiedinto the cash crop from sugar two years ago.

Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against thebackdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthlyBusiness Indicators publication.    "For the past two years, the government has struggled withan economic reality that demands measures beyond those which itsees as politically practicable," it said.    The political climate meant there would be a continuedover-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate andmaintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.    "The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revivalof business investment will be further postponed," it said.    The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted byexport and import-replacement industries which had created afalse suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance ofpayments crisis were past. "Unfortunately, successful adjustmentto Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains along-term process," it said.    In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderateoverall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP)rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.    The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDPthis year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would growstrongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion atend-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.

It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,plant and equipment, were free of the action.    Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operatingsubsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, areaffected, it said.    But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 centsper share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repaymentson debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.    Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers weredemanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as aresult of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.    Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bondof more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almostmatches the damages awarded against Texaco.    Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could beginto attach its assets to secure the judgment.    Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cutTexaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back tothe Texas courts.    Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze allTexaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits ofthe Pennzoil lawsuit.    "Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bondissue and the larger dispute failed," James Kinnear, Texaco'spresident and chief executive officer, told reporters.    Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers onFriday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing untilthe end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.    Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cashbond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct ofearnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would notsell any assets, Kinnear said.    Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter ofcredit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under11.1 billion dlrs, he added.    Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said thecompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco onSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed forbankruptcy.    He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing aconfidentiality agreement between the two companies. "Texacotold us they would get back to us but instead they chose to goto bankruptcy court," Jamail said.    Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company wouldprevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets wereample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full. REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, GERMAN CAPITAL MARKET LIBERALIZATION STALLS, West Germany's capital marketliberalization program has stalled and bankers are worried itmay take years for further reforms to be completed.    Liberalization got underway in May 1985 when foreign banksreceived Bundesbank permission to lead-manage mark eurobonds.    Further moves included introduction of mark-denominatedcertificates of deposit last year. But other changes, includingrevisions in the domestic options market and introduction offutures contracts, need lengthy statutory changes and this maytake years, bankers and dealers say.    Deutsche Bank AG co-chairman F. Wilhelm Christians calledlast week for an enlargement of current capital marketinstruments to include instruments already standard abroad.    He said these are needed especially when prices fall,citing declines in West German share prices in the first twomonths of this year when stock indices fell about 20 pct.    Others are more blunt. Securities dealers say the lack ofviable hedging instruments for shares and bonds makes tradingin domestic markets too risky.    "We need a stock index futures contract, and a futurescontract for recent government bonds," one dealer said.    West Germany now has options contracts on about five pct ofshares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.    Options can only be written on the original 14 bondsselected when bond options were introduced last April. The mostrecent bond on the list was issued in 1985.    There are no futures exchanges in West Germany. Germanbanks may participate in futures exchanges through branchesabroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringentWest German rules requiring that every contract be secured on aone-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.    Another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existingmarkets, owing to lack of private investor participation.    Private individuals and corporations do not engage inoptions trading now due to West Germany's civil and exchangelaws, which define losses made in futures and options businessas gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.    Options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity frompension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in theseinstruments. But they are to be allowed to enter the businesssoon as the European Community begins to harmonize rulesgoverning funds.    Manfred Laux, general secretary of the West German mutualfunds association in Frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to beadopted by October 1, 1989 at the latest.    The push to adopt new instruments has not been great in thepast, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, whichgives them a bad name in West Germany. But pressure for theirintroduction here is growing.    The start-up of a Swiss futures exchange has some bankersconsidering if a similar exchange would be useful in WestGermany. They say that without innovations, some business coulddrift to London, which the Bundesbank vehemently opposes.    An official at the London International Financial FuturesExchange (LIFFE) said the exchange currently has no plans tointroduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existingmark-dollar contract. But he said the exchange is studying thefeasibility of other contracts, including one for three-monthmark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.    A Bundesbank capital markets expert said the Bundesbank hasno objections to hedging through futures but any liberalizationin that sector is still in the early planning stages afterearlier talks ended two years ago.    Considerations about the futures business have been drawnout because of the large number of participants involved intalks. They include parliament, the Bundesbank, the FederalBanking Supervisory Board, eight West German stock exchangesand their governing states, and the four West German bankingassociations.    Beyond options and futures, other changes being suggestedinclude replacing the federal government's current bondconsortium with an auction procedure similar to one beingconsidered in the U.K. And already in practice in the U.S.    This would upset the existing market order providing Germanand foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but itwould eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presentlyarise within the fixed consortium quota system.    In addition, some bankers would like the method of bondtrading on the West German stock exchange changed to a systemof continuous price-setting from the current system in whichevery bond price is fixed once a day.    This would make trading more transparent if it reduced theproportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pctof the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say. REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS, A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said.    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire.    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations.    TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto.    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.    "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary.    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said.    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added.    "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome)," Gobert said.    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward," he said.    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said.    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's.    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.    However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer. REUTER&#3;

The decision to file for bankruptcy follows a courtdecision that it had to post an 11 billion dlr bond to continueits court battles with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.    One head trader at a U.S. Securities house said, "I don'twant to be obstructive, but there genuinely is no market inTexaco bonds at the moment.

One dealer noted that Texaco subsidiaries have outstandingeurobonds totalling over three billion dlrs out of totalborrowings of some 6.8 billion dlrs.    He added that many of the fixed interest eurobonds - dollarstraights - had been trading "basis only" for some time prior tothis weekend's news. This means traders could quote a two wayprice for the bonds but would not be bound to trade them. Anytrades would be negotiated.    He said that recently there appeared to have been somespeculative buying of the bonds from the U.S. But that Europeaninvestors had been overall sellers.

Nakasone and other LDP leaders have already hinted at adelay in the implementation of the tax, which had beenscheduled for next January, and a possible cut in the rate.    "The most important thing now is to get parliamentaryapproval of the budget as soon as possible to arrest a rapidappreciation of the yen," Nakasone said.

reut2-016.sgm, TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN, Member states of the EuropeanCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan whichthey believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to openits market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ECcountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with thewillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanesegovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, asEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction toan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC couldraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligationsentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designedto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that ofthe U.S.    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC'strade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February.    In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billiondlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell onepct to 12.43 billion dlrs.    In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France hasdecided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.    Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozenCoquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict applicationof French quality standards -- something EC states say oftenhappens to their own exports entering Japan.    Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanesebanks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out incompetition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.    However, British officials in London have said that thegovernment may have gone too far in implying that it would takeimmediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.    By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successfuleconomy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferringto rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its ownindustries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.    The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recentyears, substituting general calls for action by Japan to openits market with specific demands for moves in key areas.    At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to endallegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines andspirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contractsfor the building of a new international airport, and tosimplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.    EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, butoften the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariffbarriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.    They stress, however, that any action must be taken by theEC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.    One of the problems Britain could face if it were towithdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankerswould be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,they point out.

"If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings provetrue, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of itsvaluable markets," he said in a statement.    Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWBspokesman said there was a general industry feeling thatfarmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cutback plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would becut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers werefacing enormous financial pressures.    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mlnhectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and plantingintentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.    If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut inplantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developedwith much time and effort, it may have great difficulty sellingwheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.    "Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheatunderstand a decrease in production due to drought but theywill have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision todecrease production," Condon said.    "If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major exportincome earner, governments and government authorities will needto closely examine ways of contributing to the continuingviability of the wheat industry," he added.

Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and thecourt said it would give its verdict within six weeks. "However,that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court torefer questions on the interpretation and application of thelevy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg," Pex added.    Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not takeaccount of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean acompounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy inits own national currency than it received down the chain fromthe original producer of the grain.    "We would like the Business Administration Court in theHague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whetherthe Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but alsowhether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,"Pex said.    "It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,but we have had no political help, and therefore have no optioneven though it could take years," Pex added.    Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against thegrain levy because the bill the company received from thecommodity board included grain from a wide variety of originsand was therefore considered to be the best general basis for alegal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.    Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions onthe levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a casebrought by the Association of European Animal FeedManufacturers, FEFAC. REUTER&#3;

"We have come to seek the opening of Japan's financial andbanking markets," Jake Garn, ranking Republican on the SenateBanking Committee, told Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.    "Japan's financial and banking market is very large andincreasingly sophisticated, but there is not yet truereciprocity between Japan and the United States in this market,"the ministry official quoted Garn as saying.    Nakasone replied that some problems exist over providingmore seats on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for foreign firms, oneof the main steps urged by the U.S. Delegation.    "But I promise to make Tokyo's markets as open as those ofNew York," he told Garn and three other legislators.

reut2-016.sgm, EURO-MEDIUM TERM NOTES POISED FOR GROWTH, Euro-medium term notes, a recentphenomenon in the international capital markets, are hardlyattracting a flood of issuers but investment bankers are doingtheir best to breath life into the market.    Medium term notes (MTNs) have met with staggering successin the U.S. Market where total outstandings have grown toaround 50 billion dlrs since 1983, the year they took hold as anew financing vehicle to bridge the gap between commercialpaper and longer term bonds. Convinced they are here to stay,investment bankers are attempting to adapt MTNs for theeuromarket.    Ralph Bunche, a vice president of Morgan StanleyInternational, predicted at a recent Euromoney conference onMTNs here that they will become the predominant instrument forraising funds in the late 1980's and 1990's. "It (the MTNmarket) will even surpass the bond market," he said.    Other bankers took exception with the degree to which MTNswill grow. But they generally agreed that these instrumentsprovide the borrower with greater flexibility and lower coststhan a traditional bond.    The trick is in convincing European borrowers it is wortharranging a program and, having accomplished that, to persaudeEuropean investors -- whose preferences differ from their U.S.Counterparts -- to buy the securities.    Discussions with bankers proved one thing. No one isexactly sure how to proceed with structuring and marketingthese issues.    To date only 13 Euro-MTN programs have been announced butonly a few have been activated, such as those for a unit ofPepsiCo Inc and another for AB Electrolux.    Several firms have devised different structures forEuro-MTNs and defend their structures adamantly.    The PepsiCo notes, for example, are sold on a continuouslyoffered basis. This involves a small amount of new notes withsimilar maturities constantly on offer at current market rates.    The Electrolux program uses multi-tranche tap notes devisedby Merrill Lynch. Under this structure, an initial tranche of aminimum 50 mln dlrs has a fixed rate of interest and maturity.The borrower then issues additional notes in this category upto a pre-determined maximum.    Those who defend the continuously offered method, such asWendy Dietze, a Salomon Brothers Inc vice president, point tothe flexibility they offer in interest rate and maturity.    Furthermore, she believes this structure offers theEuropean investor greater confidence in market liquidity -- amajor concern for these buyers.    Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd's Kevin Regan defends themedium-tranche tap notes concept saying it offers comparableliquidity. But he also said that this structure may not be theright option for all borrowers.    Peter Mortimer, a partner in the law firm Milbank, Tweed,Hadley and McCloy, noted that legal requirements could welldetermine which structure is chosen.    He noted that the tap system allows a more clearly defined"lock-up" period as each tranche has a specific maturity. In thecase of notes issued by U.S. Borrowers, the "lock-up" period isthe 90 days after the completion of a series during which timea security cannot be sold back to the U.S. Or to U.S.Investors.    However, he said that the Securities and ExchangeCommission is reviewing its current regulations on theownership of foreign securities by U.S. Citizens and that somesoftening in the rules could come in the not too distantfuture.    For their part borrowers say they feel a bit like guineapigs.    Petter Skouen, executive vice president of the NordicInvestment Bank (NIB), noted that a few weeks ago NIB wouldhave said it was disappointed with its Euro-MTN program, butthat the success of a recent issue changed their minds.    He conceded that in retrospect it would have been wiser toestablish separate programs for the euromarket and the U.S.Domestic market, rather than try to extend the U.S. Issueglobally. Under NIB's 200 mln dlr program, 100 mln has beensold in the U.S. And 25 mln in Europe. REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY, The five leading West German economicresearch institutes have failed to agree about how strongly thedomestic economy will expand this year but revised downforecasts contained in a report published six months ago.    The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essenpredicted in the institutes' joint spring report that grossnational product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, comparedwith 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecastthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlinand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.    The joint report said that the estimates of economicdevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were "markedly lessfavourable" than those of the other three.    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after aslow start to the year. "In the second half of 1987 there will,however, only be a weak upward movement," they said.    The two institutes said external economic factors whichwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports woulddominate the economic environment throughout the year. They sawexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted nomarked improvement in the course of the year.    The other three institutes, however, wrote: "The decline indemand and production (seen) in the winter months does notindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing."    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporateuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.But they expected that many investments had not been cancelledbut only put off. "It can be presumed that the braking actions(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year."    They added: "The domestic prerequisites for a continuationof the economic uptrend are still favourable."    These three institutes said diminishing external burdenscombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn indemand and production could be expected by the spring.    However, this projection was clouded by risks including thefurther development of the mark against the dollar.    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said thatwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of theeconomy in 1987, "there is good reason to believe that exportswill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge duringthe course of the year." They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fallin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.    The three more positive institutes saw private consumptionrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving butpredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline inunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said thejobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people inwork of about 200,000.    These three institutes said new jobs would be createdmainly in the private services sector and also by the state inthe context of job creation measures. The construction industrywas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980but they predicted either no rise in employment in themanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur onlyin the tertiary sector, while "the number employed in themanufacturing industry will decline."    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw acurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marksand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start torise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all fivepredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct. REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, ELECTION RESULT MAY DELAY JAPAN ECONOMIC STIMULUS, The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's(LDP) setback in Sunday's nationwide local elections may forcethe government to water down its controversial proposal for afive pct sales tax and undermine its commitment to stimulatingthe economy, private economists said.    The LDP's failure to win seats in some crucial localconstituencies will weaken the government's ability to pushthrough its tax plan, and without a compromise tax proposal thebudget for fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31 is unlikely to bepassed soon, they said.    Without the budget, the government would also behard-pressed to come up with an effective package to stimulatethe economy as pledged at Group of Seven meetings in Paris inlate February and in Washington last week, they said.    Opposition protests against the sales tax have stalledparliamentary debate on the budget for weeks and forced thegovernment to enact a stop-gap 1987/88 budget that began earlythis month.    "The LDP's election setback will have an enormous impact onthe already faltering economy," said Johsen Takahashi, chiefeconomist at Mitsubishi Research Institute.    Takahashi said that behind the LDP's poor showing waspublic discontent with the government's high-handed push fortax reform and its lack of effective policies to cope witheconomic woes caused by the yen's appreciation.    "This explains why the LDP failed to regain governorships inthe most hotly contested constituencies of Fukuoka andHokkaido, where the shipbuilding and steel industries aresuffering heavily from the yen's extended rise," he said.    Takahashi said the government should delay introduction ofthe sales tax for one or two years beyond its original startingdate of January 1988 and implement tax cuts now.    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido also saidhe favours watering down the proposed sales tax whilesuggesting the government boost public works spending bymodifying its tight fiscal policies.    "The local election results were a signal the economy nowneeds government action to take clear-cut fiscal measures," hesaid, adding that such moves would help the world economy aswell as Japan's.    For the last five years or so, the government has stuck toa tight fiscal policy in a bid to halt the issue of deficitfinancing bonds by fiscal 1990/91, economists said.    If the LDP election setback leads to a scaled down salestax proposal, the government would have to find other revenuesources to help finance the planned tax cuts and a package ofmeasures to stimulate the economy, the economists said.    Koido said the government could raise additional revenue byselling shares in public corporations such as Nippon Telegraphand Telephone Corp. But it should issue additional bonds toensure a more stable source of funds, he said.    "It may run counter to its avowed policy of balancing thebudget, but it can do so on a short-term basis," he said.    Takahashi of Mitsubishi Research also agreed with the needfor the government to float more bonds to raise funds neededfor economic expansion.    He said additional government borrowing would place noburden on the capital market because it has amassed huge excessfunds and government bond prices have risen to record levelslately.    "The market is just waiting for more new government bondissues," he said. REUTER&#3;

However, the institutes criticised the government, not onlyfor the timing of the reform, but also because the question ofits financing had been left open.    The government has not specified how the remaining 19billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.    The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn hadcaused uncertainty among companies and households as to whatexactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged aquick decision from the government.    They also said the government should reduce taxpreferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged arestriction of state spending and called for no increase invalue-added tax.    The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasingsubsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.    They referred specifically to a doubling of specialwritedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in apackage of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described thisas an increase in subsidies.    The institutes said total subsidies, including taxpreferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risenfurther since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, itshould be possible "despite ... Major political difficulties" tofinance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.    The institutes said that if the government raised valueadded tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of thepositive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.    The report also noted that the government was progressingonly slowly with its plans to privatise state companies andsaid more deregulation was needed. The government had to aimfor more competition, it said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, EC COULD DECIDE ON JAPAN TRADE MOVES IN LATE MAY, The European Community (EC) haseffectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open itsmarket to imports before it decides on possible toughretaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.    They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.    The EC executive commission was asked by representatives ofmember states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some ECpledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market."    Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposingstiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japaneseexports.    The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would bediscussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministerson April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepareproposals for possible retaliatory action.    They said the commission has powers to take some limitedaction before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japaneseexports of electrical, photographic and other goods beingdiverted to Europe in the wake of possible U.S. Tariff moves.    In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how toprevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as aresult of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obligesthem gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.    Meanwhile, Japan's trade surplus with the Community hasgrown steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch. REUTER&#3;

Companies mentioned in market speculation as potentialbuyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N>, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd&lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.    Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had anotherproposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with athird company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in astatement.    The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,but did not identify the companies involved in talks.    TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipelineoperator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, commonand preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary whichwould own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offeris to Dome management, not to shareholders.    Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.    Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement "violatedthe terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement enteredinto with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed toprevent Dome from considering other proposals.    It said the TransCanada bid "seems to require favourable andsubstantial taxation concessions from the federal andprovincial governments." But Dome added that its management andfinancial advisers will evaluate all proposals.    TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said hewas surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and deniedthat TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (Dome'sstatement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision toauthorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announceit," he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of theother bidders, or the terms of other offers.    Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on theToronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981. REUTER&#3;

Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo saythey are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currenciesare the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japanshrinking?    What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar downmade world trade problems worse rather than solving them,fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast ofworld trade recession?    U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollarfall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Fivepact in New York.    The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pctmore competitive in Japan. The officials, most of themeconomists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan risingrapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declinedonly 11 pct against the yen.?    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widelyinterpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollarmust go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials canonly offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.    "I don't know and I don't think anyone knows," said HughRichardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.    "What I do know is that Community exporters are making ahell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, thereis money to be made in Japan," he added.    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive tradepractices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such asagriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonablechecking and customs procedures for car imports.    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in theface of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, theyblame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.    "We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,"said a senior official, who declined to be named. "We like torefrain from accusing them of not making enough effort."    Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of theKeidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Moritarepeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort tounderstand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree.

The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonallyadjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged fromFebruary and close to the average for the last six months.    The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pctin February.    But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips andDrew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected arise in excise duties which affected the index in March lastyear.    He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much intothe monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in Aprilwould take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.    Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' inputprices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factorssuch as a fall in industrial electricity costs.    Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures wereslightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterlinghad not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.    Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep inputcosts down over the next few months, although Tinker added thatlast year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of theyear-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return torises in the index rather than falls.

The bank, which had total assets of 20.1 mln dlrs, was thefirst bank in Utah to fail this year and the 59th nationwide.    Its three offices will reopen today as branches of DixieState Bank and its depositors will automatically becomedepositors of the assuming bank.    Dixie State Bank will assume about 19.9 mln dlrs in 6,300deposit accounts and will purchase all of the failed bank'sassets at a discount of 3.575 mln dlrs.    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed Summit Savings andLoan Association, Park City, Utah, and directed the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to transfer anestimated 116.9 mln dlrs in insured deposits to United Savingsand Loan Association, Ogden, Utah, an FSLIC spokesman said.    Summit, a 120.8 mln dlr institution, was insolvent, thespokesman said. The bank board appointed the FSLIC asconservator for the association on April 14, 1986.    Summit has since operated as part of the bank board'sManagement Consignment Program. United Savings has 205 mln dlrsin assets and nine offices in Utah, and one in Idaho. REUTER&#3;
reut2-016.sgm, G-7 SEEMS WORRIED MARKETS IGNORE COORDINATION, Top officials of leading industrialnations appear deeply worried that financial markets haveignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which theybelieve they strengthened in talks last week.    Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that themarkets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severelydisrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of thepolicy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.    Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way toreassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with astatement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladurunderscored that by saying: "I don't believe at all that theAmericans want a weaker dollar."    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said thedollar's latest rapid descent "involves the risk -- now alreadya tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,leading to a renewed rise in interest rates."    But there were signs too, that while policymakers fearedthe market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little theycould do until the economic picture changed, and currenciessettled into a stable pattern as a result.    Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week'ssemi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higherU.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapiddescent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.    Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman toldtelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of drivingthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.    "It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which wouldadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it woulddrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not(into) recession, into slower growth," he said.    Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize thedollar, Balladur said: "When a currency is maintainedartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it isnot healthy."    And resorting to higher interest rates could lead torecession, he said.    Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact oflife, Balladur said, "there may be adjustments of course in oneor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system."    But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said hemight rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.    U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted itunderstood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.    "The United States and the six major industrial countriesare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in theseagreements," Baker told the meetings.    Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets whichwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a furtherdecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed tostabilizing currencies at current levels.    Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreedto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fightprotectionism.    West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulatedomestic demand and lead a global upturn.    Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan'spromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.    The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a majoraction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stablecurrencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those atthe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.    The Paris accord said, "currencies (are) within rangesbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, giventhe policy commitments summarized in this statement."    Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especiallyagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistentwith the agreement. "The ministers and governors reaffirmed theview that around current levels their currencies are withinranges broadly consistent with fundamentals," last week'sstatement read.    Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets werefocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japanrather than prospective policy changes. European monetarysources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meantbusiness with its commitment to cut the budget deficit. Reuter&#3;
reut2-016.sgm, INSTITUTES SEE NO WEST GERMAN RECESSION, The five leading West German economicresearch institutes, which have revised down their forecastsfor 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany,their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.    The institutes were divided in their spring report onforecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth andtwo seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.    Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said,"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with thebeginning of a recession." He added, however, that exportsremained the weak point of the economy .    Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect furtherencroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.

"I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to betrying to do is to get the other major industrial nations thatare involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,"Bentsen told NBC Television's "Meet the Press."    Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take "billions offthe debt service of the Latin countries" and help easeprotectionist pressures in the industrial countries.    Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured torevalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.    "You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperationthere," he said.    Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told thesame television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had notfallen enough against the currencies of some countries.    "I think that more does have to be done there innegotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs(newly industrialized countries)," he said.

reut2-016.sgm, OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS, A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said.    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire.    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations.    TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto.    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.    "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary.    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said.    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added.    "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome)," Gobert said.    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward," he said.    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said.    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's.    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.    However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer. Reuter&#3;
reut2-016.sgm, SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW>, Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he hasraised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs eachfrom 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seekingto 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.    In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by hisMTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the prorationperiod will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer hadbeen scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said hehad received a "negligible" number of shares in response to theoffer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.    Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mlncommon shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on aprimary basis.    Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization planas an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholderswould receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subjectto approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held inJune.    The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mlndlrs in debt to finance the payout.    Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that theamended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares togive him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and onthe arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by NewJersey and Nevada gaming authorities.    He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring allof Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by amerger transaction.    Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shareshe is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.    He said he still has received only a "negligible" number ofshares in response to his tender.    In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included inthe statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing toincrease the price of his offer.    Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully inplace.    Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now deliveredto him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasingdividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS HoldingCorp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.    He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads asyndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlrmargin facility, believes it will be able to arrange forfurther commitments under the margin facility to advance up toan additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit thepurchase of shares under the offer.    Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted intoSeries A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby anindependent investment baking firm.    He said "To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdharesare purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive acombination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a valueof 32 dlrs per share of Caesars."    Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior toCaesars' recapitalization.    Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gamingofficials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatoryprocess required for regulatory approval, a process that italready underway in New Jersey.    He said his offer has been extended based on the likelyduration of the regulatory process.    He said he intends to further extend the offer if theapproval process is not completed by the expiration date. Reuter&#3;

United Automobile Workers (UAW) president Owen Bieber wasloudly cheered by some 3,000 local delegates at a specialbargaining strategy convention yesterday when he declared the1.1 mln-member union is ready to go to "war" against the majorauto makers in support of its goals.    "It takes two to make peace, but only one to make war ...and if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it. War against theinsecurity of layoff," the UAW chief said.    The militant tone as the four-day convention openedunderscored the probability for bitter confrontation during thesummer's labor negotiations between the UAW and the autocompanies over new contracts covering some 500,000 U.S. workersat G.M. and Ford.    The current pacts expire September 14.    GM Vice President and chief labor negotiator Alfred Warrenrecently told Reuters that the 1987 bargaining round wouldlikely be the most difficult of the decade because of thecarmaker's drive to cut costs and shed uncompetitiveparts-making operations employing thousands of workers.    Job security has been the union's main theme for severalyears. A master resolution stating UAW goals notes that theunion's membership working in the auto industry has fallen by200,000 since 1978 to a current level of about 690,000.    GM was hit by a six-day selective national strike in 1984before signing its current labor agreement, which contains aone billion dlr job security fund to protect workers whose jobsare threatened by new technology or moves to outside suppliers.    At Ford, which has more than 8 billion dlrs in cashreserves and out-earned larger GM last year for the first timesince 1924, executives said they would oppose the UAW's demandfor a return to guaranteed percentage annual pay increases thatwere dropped in the last recession.    Ford has not been hit by a national strike since 1976,which has prompted some union analysts to suggest it is nowFord's "turn," to be the UAW strike target.    Bieber yesterday described the UAW's situation in 1987 as"crucial" in view of the growing penetration of the U.S. marketby imported cars and trucks as well as moves by the Detroitautomakers to use foreign and other non-union sources to securecheaper vehicles and auto parts.    He said the union will stress job security, annual generalpay raises, improved profit-sharing and limits on companies'ability to transfer work. Reuter&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS, Portugal's economy, which has beenenjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latestgovernment crisis, analysts said.    But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal CavacoSilva's government could slow economic reforms and investmentas Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the EuropeanCommunity, which it joined in January last year, they said.    Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, wastoppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.    The centre-right administration had made economic growthreform a priority in its 17 months in office.    In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its currentaccount surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs andinflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.    Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instabilitywere worrying but they felt the foundations for continuedgrowth had not been badly shaken.    "The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that isnow less dependent on the political situation," said FritzHaser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.    "The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet," economistJorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.    Businessmen have identified political instability over thelast 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lastingeconomic progress.    The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974revolution.    Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remainbuoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surgein economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largelyunderpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.    Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank ofPortugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growthwould remain at similar levels this year.    But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policiesand could slow economic development.    Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the endof the month, can either call early elections or form a newgovernment from parties in the existing left wing-dominatedparliament.    Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quickelections as the best solution. "There is a good chance that amajority government could result from early elections,"Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president PedroFerraz da Costa said.    He said they were optimistic this could mean thecontinuation in the near future of liberalisation policiesintroduced over the last year.    The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, butthe PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion pollssay they could win an overall majority.    A PSD majority would also open the way for morewide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws andpossible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.    Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition partiesof blocking key economic reforms.    The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic resultswere more the product of favourable international conditionssuch as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSDpolicies. REUTER&#3;

Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiarysaid, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice aproposal to include these costs in the company's most recentpurchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.    Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denialruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternativefiling if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing toinclude the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA orconsolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filingand permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.    The company said the alternative filing seeks to recoverabout 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas salescommodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based onrecovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,beginning April 1, 1987.    Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipelinecommodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.    The company said it orginially sought to include thesecosts in its PGA since the payments to products resulted inalmost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and werenot related to take-or-pay buyout costs.    It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-paybuyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filingunder the Natural Gas Act.    As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average pricepaid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrsper mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April1985.

reut2-016.sgm, TEXACO &lt;TX> USES BANKRUPTCY COURT TO BUY TIME, Texaco Inc.'s plunge into bankruptcy toshield it from posting a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr legalbattle with Pennzoil Co. &lt;PZL> is a strategy that will give itbreathing room until the fight over the 1984 acquisition ofGetty Oil Co. winds its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court,analysts said.    Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, filed forprotection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code earliertoday, saying it had no choice because of Pennzoil's refusal tonegotiate a reasonable settlement.    But unlike most Chapter 11 cases, the Texaco proceedingshould not result in a major reorganization of the company oraffect its daily business operations, several experts said.    "This is another piece of financial history," SanfordMargoshes, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said ofthe bankruptcy filing. "What Texaco is doing is buying time tofight its battle in the courts. They have high hopes they willbe upheld if the case goes all the way to the U.S. SupremeCourt."    Margoshes said he did not anticipate any significantchanges in Texaco's oil exploration and production businessbecause the bankruptcy filing affects only about four pct ofthe giant oil company's 32.6 billion dlrs in annual revenues.    Texaco executives said the bankruptcy filing wouldeffectively halt payments of stock dividends and repayment ofits 6.8 billion dlr debt, but added that the company's assetsfar exceeded its liabilities.    "Texaco's cash flow is at a very respectable rate of about15 dlrs per share annually," Margoshes said. "Obviously, thepoint of Chapter 11 was not so much seeking protection fromcreditors as it was seeking protection from the predatorPennzoil."    The two companies have been locked in an acrimoniousstruggle since a Texas state court jury in November 1985ordered Texaco to pay Pennzoil 10.53 billion dlrs forimproperly interfering with Pennzoil's planned acquisition ofGetty Oil Co. In a major setback for Texaco last week, the U.S.Supreme Court said Texaco must abide by Texas state law thatrequires posting a bond for the full amount of the judgmentwhile the merits of the case were appealed.    Although a Texas appeals court hearing was scheduled Monday(April 13) on Texaco's motion to reduce the amount of the bondrequired under state law, Texaco elected not to risk losing theimportant court ruling that could have required it to post morethan 10 billion dlrs in collateral.    The bankruptcy filing, analysts said, effectively freezesall of Texaco's obligations while it continues to appeal themerits of the Pennzoil lawsuit.    "This is a drastic measure," said Rosario Ilacqua, ananalyst with L.F. Rothschild in New York. "But it's also anindictment of the legal system in this country in that Texacowas forced to seek bankruptcy when it couldn't get a fairhearing."    Ilacqua predicted that the Texas jury judgment wouldultimately be overturned or whittled down from its original10.53 billion dlrs, an amount that is increasing by about 2.5mln dlrs in interest accumulated daily. Texaco has contestedthe ruling, insisting that Pennzoil did not have a validcontract under New York state law to acquire Getty Oil.    Suggestions by some experts that the Texaco bankruptcymight be an incentive for Pennzoil to lower its settlementdemands, which are widely believed to be between 3 billion and5 billion dlrs, were discounted by indignant Pennzoilexecutives.    "I think it makes it much more difficult to settle," saidBaine Kerr, Pennzoil's retired president who has acted as thecompany's chief negotiator in the Texaco litigation. "I thinkthat's one of the main reasons they did it."    Joseph Jamail, a Houston lawyer for Pennzoil, said thecompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco onSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed forbankruptcy. He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal,citing a confidentiality agreement between the two companies.    "Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead theychose to go to bankruptcy court," Jamail said. "This was anirresponsible and unneeded move."    Ilacqua also said the bankruptcy filing appeared toeliminate any chance of settlement in the near-term.    "There have been some crazy numbers floating around insettlement discussions," Ilacqua said. "I think 1 billion dlrsettlement would be more than adequate for Pennzoil. I don'tknow if that Texas jury really understood what money is. Theygave Pennzoil an astronomical judgment."    Analysts said they expected Texaco stock, which closedFriday at 31 and 7/8, to slip to about 25 when the New YorkStock Exchange opened Monday morning.    Lawyers for Pennzoil said they believed the company wouldprevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets wereample enough to ultimately pay the Pennzoil judgment in full. Reuter&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN, Member states of the EuropeanCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan whichthey believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to openits market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ECcountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with thewillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanesegovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, asEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.   Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction toan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC couldraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligationsentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designedto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that ofthe U.S.    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC'strade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February.

reut2-016.sgm, EC COULD DECIDE ON JAPAN TRADE MOVES IN LATE MAY, The European Community (EC) haseffectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open itsmarket to imports before it decides on possible toughretaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.    They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.    The EC executive commission was asked by representatives ofmember states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some ECpledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market."    Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposingstiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japaneseexports.    The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would bediscussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministerson April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepareproposals for possible retaliatory action.    They said the commission has powers to take some limitedaction before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japaneseexports of electrical, photographic and other goods beingdiverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.    In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how toprevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as aresult of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obligesthem gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.

reut2-016.sgm, GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY, Four of West Germany's five leadingeconomic research institutes warned that excessive monetarygrowth threatened a resurgence of inflation.    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, saidthe expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did notnecessarily threaten stability.    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in whichthree -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise inGNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome inview of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience hasshown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a pricerise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears mayseem exaggerated, they said.    "But it has often turned out in the past that the priceclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank intoa restrictive policy," they said.    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy areless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.    The four institutes disputed the view that monetaryexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domesticinvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital marketinvestments following lower interest rates.    "Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion ofcentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to asmaller expansion of money supply," they said.    A return to growth and stability did not requirespectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly withopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoidan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not befocused simply on growth of production potential. Because ofuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economicweakness other factors should be taken into account.    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cutsand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluationspeculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threatin itself to price stability.    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growthreflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and thefalling mark. REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, SAUDI ARABIA LIBERALISES BANKING SYSTEM, Saudi Arabia has speeded up reform ofits financial system with a package of measures designed toboost the economy and open up the Kingdom to the lucrativeworld of investment banking.    Bankers in Saudi Arabia detect a fundamental shift inpolicy stemming from a need to tackle the underlyingcontradiction between an Islamic legal framework and westernbanking system.    One senior banker in Jeddah said: "There is a new windblowing... Saudi Arabia is moving on many fronts in a mannerthat is extraordinarily aggressive."    The speed of reform, begun last year but now gatheringpace, has surprised bankers who have had to contend with afinancial system that restricted internationalisation of theriyal and a religious court system that made debt collectingdifficult.    Saudi banks, once the most profitable in the world, havegenerally reported falling profits for 1986 -- the fourthsuccessive year of decline -- as loan loss provisions ate intoalready dwindling earnings.    Bankers say the Saudi Finance Ministry and Saudi ArabianMonetary Agency (SAMA) seem to have developed a new strategyalthough it remains to be seen how it will be implemented.    Reform started in 1986 with measures to boost previouslydormant stock trading, but took off in earnest this year.    -- From January 1, SAMA liberalised the money market,giving banks greater access to liquidity aid via repurchaseagreements.    -- From March 22, the Finance Ministry abolishedwithholding tax on funds borrowed by Saudi banks abroad.    -- From the same date, banks were notified of a newcommittee to be set up under the auspices of SAMA to hear bankdisputes with creditors over non-payment of loans.    -- Also from the same date, banks were allowed to usemortgages as collateral for lending, banned since 1981.    -- Within a few weeks, the Kingdom's first stock markettrading floor is expected to be opened.    Housed in central Riyadh in the building of the SaudiIndustrial Development Fund, the floor will initially be usedto trade shares on an auction system. Staff from each of the 11commercial banks have been trained ahead of the launch and anew computer network has been set up.    One banker said: "The abolition of withholding tax will givebanks the opportunity to participate in new instruments such asinterest rate or currency swaps. At last SAMA and the FinanceMinistry are opening up markets for investment banking."    Bankers say Saudi authorities appear to have been shockedinto reform by pressure from banks and alarm at bank reluctanceto extend further loans to the private sector.    Banks have lobbied hard for change, arguing that thereligious, or Sharia, legal framework was inconsistent with theKingdom's western banking system and made it nigh impossiblefor them to collect interest on bad loans through the courts.    As a result, many banks had virtually stopped new lending,but found themselves cut off from world investment banking by aseries of restrictions. Withholding tax made it punitivelyexpensive to take part in interest rate or currency swaps.    The private sector's frustration at the virtual standstillin bank lending overflowed at a businessmen's conference in themountain resort in Abha last month and some powerful merchantfamilies also called for change, bankers said.    "Banks lobbied hard and had the ultimate weapon to forcechange -- they stopped lending," another banker said. "That wasstifling growth of the economy."    It is still unclear whether the new committee that will beset up to hear bank disputes with creditors will prove any moreefficient than another non-Sharia system already in force, theCommittees for the Settlement of Commercial Disputes (CSCDs).    Some bankers believe the new committee, yet to be formed,will simply delay pending cases and force banks into a seriesof private deals with creditors.    Nor is it clear what stance the new committee will take oninterest payments, generally not recognised under Islamic law.    But other bankers say the move is clear recognition by SAMAand the Finance Ministry that Sharia courts and the CSCDs werenot the correct bodies for hearing bank disputes.    Other reforms have been taken or are in the pipeline.Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail said in March that anew body would examine late government payments to contractors.    In addition, further moves are under way to align businesslife to the Gregorian calendar year, with companies being urgedto adopt it as their financial year.    A black list of borrowers, started more than two years agoby banks, has recently been effectively sanctioned by SAMA,bankers say.    Banks are now not permitted to lend or engage in securitiestransactions with any party on the list. REUTER&#3;

Baker, a lawyer representing Texaco, told reportersthat the nation's third largest oil company was forced to seekbankruptcy protection because of its precarious fianncialcondition and problems with suplliers and bankers stemming fromthe 10.53 billion dlr judgement.    "All activity after the filing can be conducted on normalbusiness terms," Baker said.    He said Texaco would seek permission from the court tocontinue its appeal in Texas courts of the Pennzoil judgement.    "There will be no bond required because all state courtlitigation has been stayed," Baker said.    When asked whether Texaco's reorganization plan wouldinclude major restructuring of the company, Baker declined tosay what the eventual plan might include.    "I think Texaco will succesfully complete its Chapter 11proceedings and have a reorganization plan approved by thecourt," he said.    Baker said Texaco expected Pennzoil to seek a seat on acreditors' committee to be appointed by the bankruptcy courtsbut added he did not know whether Texaco would oppose such anattempt.    Lawyers for both sides also said that each companycontinued to be interested in a possible settlement, butdeclined to say whether any negotiations were scheduled betweenthe two companies.    "Texaco has tried to settle and will continue and try andsettle," Baker said.    The two companies reportedly remain far apart in what eachconsiders to be a fair settlement, with Pennzoil seekingbetween three and five billion dlrs, while Texaco hasmaintained it cannot pay more than about one billion dlrs,according to analysts.

reut2-016.sgm, WALL STREET STOCKS/TEXACO &lt;QTX>, PENNZOIL &lt;PZL>, Texaco Inc's decision to file forprotection under the bankruptcy code had a chilling effect onits stock, and sent Pennzoil Co's shares sharply lower as well,traders said.    Texaco dropped 3-1/2 to 28-3/8 and Pennzoil fell 12-7/8 to79-3/8.    "A lot of people had bid up Pennzoil, expecting asettlement of two to five billion dlrs in this case," energyanalyst Rosario Ilacqua of L.F. Rothschild said, "and nownobody knows where this is going to settle out."    "It seems to me that the hope of an out of court settlementin this long running court case had a greater relative impacton Pennzoil's stock then on Texaco's," analyst SanfordMargoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said, citing the sharperdecline in Pennzoil this morning.    The litigation arose when Pennzoil sued Texaco forinterfering in its 1984 agreement to acquire Getty Oil. In1985, a Texas state court ruled in favor of Pennzoil andordered Texaco to pay 10.53 billion dlrs in damages.    Citing the burden of the court case and a Supreme Courtruling last week in favor of Pennzoil concerning the amountTexaco must put up as a bond while appealing the case, Texacofiled for the Chapter 11 protection on Sunday.    "That decision puts Pennzoil in the unsecured creditorcatagory and that means they have lost their preferredposition, which is causing the most damage to the stock today,"Margoshes said. "They will only be able to collect paymentafter secured creditors have collected," he said.    "From the standpoint of the attractiveness of Texaco'sstock," Margoshes said, "I have turned quite bullish."    "I think there is an overreaction in the downside of the(Texaco) stock today, with some investors believing that Texacocannot effectively conduct its business. But only Texaco Incand two subsidiaries are under protection, and there is noindication that they will not be able to proceed adequately,"Margoshes said. In addition, he noted, "there are insitutionsthat just cannot legally--according to their ownregulations--hold a stock that is in bankruptcy. That causedmuch of the selling at the opening," he said.    L.F. Rothschild's Ilacqua said "you have to wonder if aninterim settlement can be reached between the two or if thisthing is going to go the full legal route, and that is whatinvestment decisions hinge on."    He said "if this whole thing settles with Texaco owing alot less than the 10 billion dlrs, speculating in Texaco stockcould be quite interesting." He expects the stock to trade 25dlr to 30 dlr a share range for as long as it takes for adecision to made in the case. Reuter&#3;

Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior managementmade Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they wereby improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's presidentand controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did notknow the names of the president and controller, and could notimmediately comment on the release.    Foster said the amount involved in the "discrepancy" isabout 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs netafter tax due to an "improper recording of job costs over aperiod of several years and continuing through part of thefirst quarter of 1987."    Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not"likely to be significant" but the amount to be charged toprior periods had not been determined.    Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mlndlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.

reut2-016.sgm, TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS, Taiwan announced plans for another roundof import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before tradetalks with Washington which officials described as a move tohelp balance trade with the United States.    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry'sCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list ofproducts included 60 items asked by Washington.    "The move is part of our government efforts to encourageimports from our trading partners, particularly from the UnitedStates," he said.    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinetthat the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cutby between five and 50 pct.    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added.    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island'slargest trading partner.    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts andpressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge tradedeficit with Taipei.    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. Itwidened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.    Today's announcement came before a departure later today ofa 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series oftrade talks with U.S. Officials.    The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters lastnight he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he wouldface tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionistsentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surpluswith Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.    Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.    "I am afraid this time we have to give more than take fromour talks with the U.S.," he said without elaborating. REUTER&#3;
reut2-016.sgm, U.S. JUNK BONDS UNAFFECTED BY TEXACO &lt;TX> FILING, Despite a sharp early fall in TexacoInc bonds, the 125 billion dlr U.S. junk bond market waslargely unaffected by Texaco's weekend filing for protectionunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, analysts said.    "Texaco's filing had little, if any, effect on junk bondprices this morning. It should not spill over to the overallmarket like LTV Corp's &lt;LTV> bankruptcy filing did lastsummer," said one analyst.    Traders said some Texaco debt issues fell over 30 pointsthis morning in thin trading, but recouped about half that.    "Because of the Texaco filing, some investors bid down itspaper to the mid-60 area (around 650 dlrs per 1,000 dlr facevalue) from around 95 Friday," said a dealer in high-yield, lowrated bonds.    "But sellers could not be found at those levels and thebids soon rebounded to the 75 to 85 area," he added, referringto such issues as Texaco's 13 pct notes of 1991, the 13-1/4s of1999 and 13-5/8s of 1994. All were in the mid-90s Friday.    The rebound occurred after Standard and Poor's Corpdowngraded the debt ratings of 8.4 billion dlrs of debt ofTexaco and its subsidiaries to D, traders noted.    S and P cited the weekend bankruptcy filing. The agencysaid it uses the D grade for securities issued by companies inChapter 11 reorganization.    Moody's Investors Service Inc followed suit, cutting mostof the debt of Texaco and its units to Caa.    The junk bond market experienced a short-lived downturnlast summer when LTV's bankruptcy filing sparked worries thatcredit conditions of other steel companies would also worsen.    "This is clearly not the case with Texaco," said onetrader. Because of their high yields, junk bonds have latelyoutperformed investment grade corporates, he and others said.    Analysts and portfolio managers said they viewed Texaco'sbankruptcy filing as a defensive move.    Indeed, a Texas State Court of Appeal this morning said thebankruptcy petition effectively stays Texaco's obligation underTexas law to post a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr litigationagainst Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.    "The filing was not the result of credit weakness. Thecompany got through the oil crisis alright," said one portfoliomanager.    Others who run junk bond portfolios agreed with thatassessment and said they would still buy high-yield issues. Reuter&#3;

The report said the assessment was based on travel in thetwo countries from March 30 to April 4.    It said crop conditions were better than earlier expectedfollowing the extreme dry conditions last fall and theprolonged winter temperatures this spring.    However, in general plant development was at least threeweeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions variedgreatly by regions, the report said.    Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, andespecially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in goodcondition, with little evidence of winterkill, while othersvaried considerably, the report said.

Borrowing on external bond markets totalled 19.7 billiondlrs, some 1.1 billion below the February figure.    The market for floating rate notes saw further setbacks andthe volume of new offerings fell to only 800 mln dlrs from 1.4billion in February.    For the first quarter as a whole, the OECD said, fundsraised on the floating rate bond market totalled three billiondlrs, the lowest figure since the third quarter of 1982.    Activity on the straight bond market was also less buoyantthan in previous months while equity-related offeringscontinued to benefit from the good performance of major stockmarkets.    Exchange rate uncertainties continued to have a majorimpact on the currency composition of new bonds. Dollar issuestotalled 6.8 billion dlrs, accounting for only 35 pct of totalofferings, but borrowing was particularly heavy on the euroyenmarket (3.3 billion dlrs) and in sterling (2.8 billion dlrs).    Offerings of mark bonds declined to 1.3 billion dlrs fromaround three billion dlrs in the two previous months, whilststrong advances were recorded in the euro-Australian andeuro-Canadian dollar sectors, where new offerings exceeded onebillion dlrs, the OECD said.    In the syndicated credit market, the volume of new loansfell to 2.4 billion dlrs in March from 4.2 billion in February.Similarly, activity on the market for note issuance and otherback-up facilities fell to one billion dlrs from 1.5 billion.    In March, OECD borrowers accounted for over 90 pct of totalborrowing. Japan was the largest fund-raiser with 4.5 billiondlrs, followed by the U.S. With 3.9 billion and Britain with2.4 billion dlrs.    France, West Germany and Norway raised funds of over onebillion dlrs each.    Borrowing by developing countries totalled one billiondlrs, about the same amount as in February.

Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initiallyto reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait's 22-tankerfleet.

Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mlndlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring theBrazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs inlost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrsfrom 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise wasmainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth inconsumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofmedium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are notresumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for thewhole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador onnon-accrual because the Quito government also suspendedinterest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interestincome by 1.5 mln dlrs.    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrsfrom 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from3.96 pct.    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, areduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculationof the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) anda narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical'scost of funds.    Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrsfrom 26.2 mln.    Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.    The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, comparedwith 83.8 mln.

reut2-016.sgm, PRIMARY GILTS DEALERS NEED NOT BUY AT AUCTIONS, Primary dealers in U.K. Government giltswill not be required to underwrite the government's offering ofits securities when the first auctions begin in Mid-May, theBank of England said.    In an official notice released today, the Bank said "Therewill be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for theauctions but the Bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers,as part of their commitment to the market, to participateactively in the auction process."    The Bank was originally believed to have favoured requiringthe dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned afterthose in the U.S. Treasury market.    However, the Treasury was believed to have baulked at therequest by the 27 market makers for an allotment commissionwhich would discourage the largest institutional investors fromplacing orders for new stock directly through the Bank ofEngland, thus denying primary dealers some of their bestcustomers. Commission would have been passed along to customerswho did place orders via the primary dealers, making it lessexpensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.    Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions withthe dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that theallotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had aconcurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless ofmarket conditions.    Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to bedisappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along withthe plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that anyconditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandonedor modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficientor unwieldy.    Among other items in the document, the Bank said its firstauction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventionalshort-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.    Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financialyear would first be of up to one billion stg of long-datedstock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up toone billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years inmaturity.    The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would bemet by traditional tap offerings of stock via the governmentbroker.    To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, theBank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stockof the same type, and it will not necessarily resume sellingthe stock once the fallow period expires.    In the event that prices offered for the stock to be soldare substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bankwill agree to take the stock onto its own books.    The bank would then be free to sell the stock during thefallow period but not at a price below the minimum tenderprice.    The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions willbe alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which biddersare allotted stock at the price which they bid.    However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit anymoney market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a singleauction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned aboutpreventing a single market maker from cornering a stock todrive the price up.   The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to preventdealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuingadditional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.    The Bank has also agreed to publish information about theauction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete,which is widely expected to be on the same day.    Information to be released will include the amount of stockallotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids,and the highest, lowest and average price of the successfulbids. REUTER&#3;

The investment dealer said the expansion would involveincreased research and retail staff, three new Canadianbranches by year-end and enhanced corporate financing ability.    Bache chief executive George McGough told a news conferencethat Bache might expand its 20 mln Canadian dlr capital base byup to seven times over the next several years.    McGough said the move resulted from the proposed June 30deregulation of Ontario's securities industry, which will liftexisting restrictions on the growth of foreign dealers such asBache and allow it access to its U.S. parent's 134 billion U.S.dlrs of capital and products offered by Prudential Insurance Coof Canada, also owned by Bache's U.S. parent.    Stressing that company growth would be internal, McGoughtold reporters "that our game plan does not call for anacquisition," saying Bache recently rejected merger overturesfrom three other investment dealers in Canada.    McGough declined to identify the names of the three dealersthat approached Bache.    He said that Bache hoped to rank in the top five Canadianinvestment dealers within the next few years. It now ranksabout 14th.    McGough voiced confidence that Bache's plans would beunaffected by any delay past June 30 in the implementation offinancial deregulation resulting from an ongoing disputebetween the Canadian and Ontario governments over regulatoryjusisdiction. He said regulators had already approved the namechange and indicated they would approve Bache's expansion. Reuter&#3;

The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction ofincome as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.    Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly tomiddle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But someof these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.    Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losseswas 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.    Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at theend of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrsof loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.

reut2-016.sgm, U.S. AUTOWORKERS SET FOR TOUGH BARGAINING ROUND, The United Automobile Workers Union,UAW, is asking local leaders to back a renewed drive for higherwages in upcoming bargaining with the car and other majorindustries while acknowledging that futher job losses areinevitable as traditional U.S. manufacturing shrinks.    The UAW will begin bargaining this summer on new contractscovering some 380,000 members at General Motors Corp, theworld's largest corporation, and nearly 110,000 members at FordMotor Co, the number two U.S. automaker.    National UAW labor contracts at both companies expire atmidnight September 14.    The union is expected to chose one of the companies as apossible strike target in early September to concentrate itsefforts.    UAW president Owen Bieber was loudly cheered by some 3,000local delegates at a special bargaining strategy conventionyesterday when he declared the union is ready to go to "war"against the major auto makers in support of its goals.    "It takes two to make peace, but only one to make war ...and if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it. War against theinsecurity of layoff," the UAW chief said.    In a 101-page document proposing its 1987 collectivebargaining program, the leadership of the 1.1 mln member unionurged "full resumption of our traditional wage formula" as "atop priority in this round of bargaining."    But the union concedes that increased foreign competition,new technology and shifts to low-cost offshore production byU.S. manufacturers will continue to cut the number of workersin the motor vehicle and agricultural equipment industries.    Union leaders told Reuters the 1987 round of bargainingwith GM and Ford will be one of the most difficult in the51-year history of the union in view of GM's announced goal toclose plants it deems non-competitive and to increase itspurchase of parts from outside suppliers as part of a massiveprogram to reduce its costs by 10 billion dlrs and reverse theprofits decline it suffered the last two years.    At Ford, where a record 3.3 billion dlrs in profits lastyear swelled its cash reserves past eight billion dlrs,analysts say the company's healthy position could make it atempting target for the union in its drive to increase wages.    Labor executives for both GM and Ford have said they willoppose any attempt to return to annual general wage increasesthat were dropped in 1982 when the Detroit-based industry wasmired in a deep recession.    But the UAW, pointing to a three pct pay increase to beimplemented later this year in the contract it negotiated withChrysler Corp after a 1985 strike, said it intends to seek fullreinstatement of annual percentage wage increases in thisyear's bargaining with GM and Ford.

reut2-016.sgm, TALKING POINT/IBM &lt;IBM>, International Business Machines Corphas started the year aggressively, but industry analysts saidthe company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stopa two-year earnings slump.    "I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than Ihave been in a long time," said PaineWebber analyst StephenSmith.    "But they're not out of the woods yet," he added.    At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easilytopped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from aneven dollar to 1.20 dlrs.    Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM'sperformance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a fullrecovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not befelt until later in the year.    These include the success of IBM's new personal computerline, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,which will begin volume shipments in July.    In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of itsearly-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves willemerge as the year progresses.    Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers wasrelatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook thanhe has been for nearly a year.    "Although the worldwide economic situation remainsunsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higherfirst-quarter shipments. "We remain optimistic about theprospects for both the industry and IBM," he said.    "Akers was most encouraging," said PaineWebber's Smith.    A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframecomputer sales all contributed to the better-than-expectedfirst-quarter results, analysts said.    "Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong inMarch," after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil ofWashington-based Weil and Associates.    Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly calledthe Sierras, "bailed out the whole quarter," Weil said, adding,"If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year."REUTER...^M&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, IRVING BANK &lt;V> 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL, Irving Bank Corp said a six pct dropin first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely theresult of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers inBrazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.    Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrsfrom 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per sharedropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.

Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mlndlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received onthese loans during the remainder of 1987.    Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on thetrading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,although these were partly offset by increased trust income,profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securitiesgains, the bank said.    The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986. Reuter&#3;

In its document on the auctions, the Bank said "The Bank iscontent for such (when-issued) trading to cevelop subject tocertain conditions, in particular for predential supervision ofthe credit risk to which the gilt-edged market makers andInter-dealer brokers may become exposed."    The Bank is widely expected to require dealers to reportwehn-issued trading positions on a daily basis.    When-issued trading presents certain unusual risks becausedealers are buying and selling a security that technically doesnot exist although there is no uncertainty about when it willbe issued.    Still, the fact there is no physical delivery possiblepresents certain credit risks as well.    The Bank is widely expected to expand its reportingrequiremenmts for unsettled trades, requiring firms to reportunsettled when-issued trades one day after they occur.Normally, unsettled trades must be reported three days afterthey occur.

reut2-016.sgm, GAF &lt;GAF> SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR> BID, GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-WarnerCorp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts tobe preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.     Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill LynchCapital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash andsecurities for the balance.    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.    "I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming inwith another bid," said one analyst, who values the company at51 or 52 dlrs per share.    GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct ofBorg-Warner's stock.    "You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to upthe price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you haveto. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're lookingat it - that it's worth more," Pershing and Co analyst RichardHenderson said.    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. MerrillLynch officials did not return phone calls.    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heymansought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plasticsbusiness. The rigid plastics are used in such things astelephones, computer terminals, and appliances.    "Where the heck can you buy a world class chemicaloperation these days," said Henderson.    "He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and hedoes not like to get pushed around," said Henderson.    GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeoverof the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAFdid not win the company, it made a substantial gain on itsinvestment in Carbide.    Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into itsBorg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offerand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company wouldgive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.    "It's a win-win situation," said one analyst.    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would beforthcoming shortly.    "I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in thisbook," he said.    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,protective services, which includes Wells Fargo securityguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who followsGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, itwould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 pershare.    "I think there's a probability he goes up in price," saidRose.    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heymanwould do. "Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."    "Is he trying to build a major industrial chemicalenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank," Rosesaid.    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would addearnings momentum to GAF. "I worked out that paying as much as50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, ifthey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities," said JohnHenry of E.F. Hutton.    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billiondlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and netearnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

reut2-016.sgm, ELECTION RESULT MAY DELAY JAPAN ECONOMIC STIMULUS, The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's(LDP) setback in Sunday's nationwide local elections may forcethe government to water down its controversial proposal for afive pct sales tax and undermine its commitment to stimulatingthe economy, private economists said.    The LDP's failure to win seats in some crucial localconstituencies will weaken the government's ability to pushthrough its tax plan, and without a compromise tax proposal thebudget for fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31 is unlikely to bepassed soon, they said.    Without the budget, the government would also behard-pressed to come up with an effective package to stimulatethe economy as pledged at Group of Seven meetings in Paris inlate February and in Washington last week, they said.    Opposition protests against the sales tax have stalledparliamentary debate on the budget for weeks and forced thegovernment to enact a stop-gap 1987/88 budget that began earlythis month.    "The LDP's election setback will have an enormous impact onthe already faltering economy," said Johsen Takahashi, chiefeconomist at Mitsubishi Research Institute.    Takahashi said that behind the LDP's poor showing waspublic discontent with the government's high-handed push fortax reform and its lack of effective policies to cope witheconomic woes caused by the yen's appreciation.    "This explains why the LDP failed to regain governorships inthe most hotly contested constituencies of Fukuoka andHokkaido, where the shipbuilding and steel industries aresuffering heavily from the yen's extended rise," he said.    Takahashi said the government should delay introduction ofthe sales tax for one or two years beyond its original startingdate of January 1988 and implement tax cuts now. Reuter&#3;

The tariffs of 100 pct - up from about five pct - are to beapplied to 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese exports includingpower tools, television sets, computer parts and audioequipment, in addition to the fingerprinting equipment.    Reagan issued a list of several dozen products that couldbe subject to the tariffs, and businessmen, lobbyists andothers asked for the exclusions in the two days of publictestimony that began today at the Commerce Department.    He said "action should be taken in such a manner thatefforts to help the semiconductor industry do not inflictextensive economic damage on the highly successful informationtechnology industry."    A spokesman for Amdahl Corp &lt;AMH>, a computer maker, saidit would be hit hard by tariffs on Fujitsu Ltd equipmentbecause Fujitsu was its only supplier of key electroniccomponents.    Makita U.S.A., Inc, a maker of hand-held electric powertools, said if tariffs were imposed on its goods it would haveto close its U.S. manufacturing operation in Buford, Ga., andlayoff its entire U.S. workforce of 600 people.    The U.S. Trade Representative's Office, which is conductingthe hearings, said the products to be assessed the highertariffs will be made public on Thursday or Friday.    It said it would base its judgment on the impact of thetariffs on the companies hit as well as on the buying public.    Some of the tariffs would double the price of imports.    Law officers from California, Illinois, Alaska andelsewhere said they relied on NEC Corp of Japan's advancedfingerprinting system and asked it be exempt from the newtariffs.    Fred Wynbrandt, representing the California attorneygeneral's office, said the tariffs would double Californiastate and local costs for fingerprinting operations.    Many of those testifying backed the idea of retaliatorytariffs but not on some goods that would hit their business.    Vico Henriques, president of the Computer and BusinessEquipment Manufacturers Association, called for exemptions forcomponents that U.S. firms bought in Japan and for goods madein Japan under a U.S. license or by a joint venture. more&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, TECHNOLOGY/COMPETITION FOR SATELLITE, Some of the United States' largestaerospace firms are competing with some of the world's mostpowerful nations for a chance to cash in on the comingcommercialization of space.      The newest space race is for contracts to launchprivately owned satellites into orbit - a business expected tobe worth two billion to five billion dlrs annually in a fewyears.    The growing opportunities to make money in space will behighlighted this month when the U.S. National OceanicAtmospheric Administration seeks lucrative commercial bids tolauch future weather satellites, ending its long-standingdependence on the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration.    Companies and countries with established satellitelaunching operations may also get a jump on eventuallyproviding other space-based services, particularly if theproposed international manned space station is launched asplanned in the early 1990s.    The 12 billion dlr space station, first proposed byPresident Reagan in 1984, could require as many as 16 cargodeliveries a year, many delivered by private firms. Thepartners in the space station are currently slated to beCanada, Japan, and the 13-nation European Space Agency, thelatter two of which also have or are developing their owncommercial space programs.     Until the Challenger explosion in January 1986, NASA had avirtual lock on the world's commercial space cargo.    But after a re-evaluation of the shuttle program, PresidentReagan declared last August that future U.S. shuttle flightswill no longer carry commercial payloads.    The administration's decision left Arianespace, aFrench-led European consortium, the only option available tosatellite owners and the concern quickly sold out all itsplanned flights through 1989.    The company also raised its prices, from 30,000 dlrs alaunch to 50,000 dlrs, but even the larger price tag did notdampen demand. Arianespace sighned 18 new contracts last year,compared with 11 in 1985.    Those kind of tariffs have caused even non-capitalistcountries to try and get a piece of the action.    China, the Soviet Union and Japan have all announcedsatellite launch programs and several U.S. firms, includingMcDonnell Douglas Corp, General Dynamics Corp and MartinMarietta promised to spend mlns of dollars over the next threeyears to develop their own satellite launch capabilities.    There will be some tremendous pent-up demand for satellitelaunches by then, analysts said. Without Challenger, there wereonly three satellite launches last year, 15 fewer than in 1985and the lowest since 1980, when only two were sent up.    Ariane expects to launch from six to eight satellites ayear for the next three years, about 75 pct of the world'ssatellite launches during that period.     McDonnell Douglas scored the biggest coup of the U.S.firms in January when it won a 734 mln dlr U.S. Air Force pactfor up to 20 unmanned rockets to launch military satellites.The contract is expected to underwrite the company's efforts tobuild rockets for private satellite launches.      Martin Marietta, however, was the first U.S. company tosign up a client, Federal Express Co. Marietta plans to launchan ExpressStar communications satellite in 1989.    Marietta said it will also build a version of its Titanrockets used by the Air Force to other private companies thatwant to get into the satellite launch buisiness.    Arianespace director Charles Bigot said the U.S. companieswill probably become the European firm's biggest competitorsfor satellite launching. He does not expect the national spaceprograms to become commercially viable until the late 1990s.    Japan has expanded its space program, launching 38government-owned satellites in the last 16 years. But most ofthem were small and it was only in February it launched itsfirst satellite that circles the earth over the poles.    Japan also has yet to design and build its own rockets. Thesatellite launched in February was placed in orbit by aMcDonnell Douglas-designed Delta rocket assembled by theJapanese under license.    Tsugo Tadakawa, director of the Washington office ofJapan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA), said Japanplans to launch seven of its H-1 rockets, an American Japanesehybrid that replaces the Delta, through 1991. Its much largersucessor, the H-II, should be ready by 1992, he said.    NASDA's annual budget is only about 800 mln dlrs, Tadakawasaid, about 10 pct the size of NASA's yearly spending.    Still, NASDA is free from private competition at home andhas the full support of the government, since aerospace waschosen by the Ministry of Trade and Information as one of thecountry's new industries for the next decade.     Surprisingly, the People's Republic of China, a relativenewcomer to aerospace, is so far the most successful competitorto Ariane.    The country's Great Wall Industry Corp is the only nationalprogram besides the European consortium to win a privatesatellite contract. It will launch a Westar communicationssatellite for New-York based Terasat in 1988. Reuter&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, EC MEAT DIRECTIVE DEADLINE SEEN FLEXIBLE, U.S. officials said they held outlittle hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw acontroversial meat inspection requirement, due to go intoeffect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cutoff their exports.    But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the yearprovided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.Agriculture Department.    The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive willrequire foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with ECinspection standards beginning April 30.    The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requestingthe Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.    At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mlndlrs in 1985.    The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changesin their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffingto use of wood.    Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approvedwithout further review. USDA would have to certify that theplants had corrected the deficiencies.    All remaining plants with a history or potential ofshipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require moresignificant changes in plant constructions or procedures beforefurther EC review.    Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American MeatInstitute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formaltrade retaliation petition by April 30.    An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draftpetition.    An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office saidU.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,but that "the chances of that are not too good at this time."    However, there is the "expectation" in U.S. government andmeat industry circles that the EC will continue to allowshipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, fromU.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bringtheir operations into conformity with the EC regulation, theUSTR official said.

reut2-016.sgm, U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON, Major U.S. banks may lift primelending rates again within days due to recent increases intheir borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve isnudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.    In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, mostbanks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their owncost of money. That spread has narrowed again.    "A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,"said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.    Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct isjustified because the spread between banks' cost of funds andthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of apercentage point.    He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentagepoints since last October until it fell below one point andtriggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.    "We could easily have another prime rate increase as soonas this week," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.    "We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in thenear future," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.    "Based on the spread between the prime rate and fundingcosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the primebecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loandemand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintainrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates.    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures liftshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. Hesaid "if there is widespread belief money market rates willstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep adollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollarfell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traderssaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way tostabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actionson Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said "it has becomeclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressurein the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interestrates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculationthat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in themarket than most economists had expected.    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in smallamounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreementswith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one anotherhigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pcttoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlrround of customer repurchase agreements.    "The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it isoffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"said Jones of Lanston.    "The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on theneed to defend the dollar," Jones said. He believes it ismerely shading policy toward restraint now, "but to have amajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policyovertly at some point."    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates bybecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, withinfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct mightwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts tofurther aid the dollar.    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime ratemay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.    "The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tighteningpolicy to defend the dollar," said Leslie of Discount Corp. Hesaid tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressuresabate will show whether or not it is firming policy.   Reuter&#3;

President Reagan's National Security Adviser Frank Carluccitold reporters "it looks like a very difficult situation at thispoint."    The Reagan administration is due to slap 100 pct tariffs ona range of Japanese products on Friday in retaliation forJapan's alleged failure to honor an agreement to stop dumpingsemiconductors in world markets outside the U.S. and failure toopen its own market to U.S. goods.

Federal Judge Ann C. Williams, in an oral ruling, said FMChad not been harmed by trading in FMC stock by Boesky and othertraders prior to FMC's two-billion dlr recapitalization lastyear.    FMC had claimed insider trading by Boesky had forced it toincrease the value of the recapitalization to 80 dlrs a sharefrom 70 dlrs a share.    FMC had charged that Boesky received confidentialinformation about FMC's planned recapitalization from DennisLevine, a former merger specialist with Drexel Burnham LambertInc.    An FMC spokeswoman said in response to an inquiry that FMCmight appeal the ruling, made in the U.S. District Court forthe Northern District of Illinois, once a formal writtendecision is received. The written ruling is expected April 15.    The spokeswoman said FMC might appeal alleged contractviolations involved in the dispute. That part of the case,involving a contract between FMC and Goldman Sachs and Co,would be appealed to an Illinois state court, she said.    Goldman Sachs was FMC's investment banker in its plannedrestructuring. A FMC spokeswoman said the contract was astandard contract under which Goldman Sachs advised FMC on therestructuring.    "We are certainly taking a look at appealing" the ruling inIllinois state court, the FMC spokeswoman said in response toan inquiry.    The suit claimed that Boesky bought 95,300 FMC sharesbetween February 18 and February 21, 1986, selling those sharesfor a profit of 975,000 dlrs on February 21, the day FMC firstsaid it was considering a recapitalization.    Also, the suit said Boesky bought a further 1,922,000 FMCshares between March 12 and April four, acknowledging thepurchase of a 7.5 pct stake in the company in a 13-D filingwith the Securities and Exchange Commission on April seven.    "We alleged his actions kept the stock price artificiallyhigh and put pressure on FMC to increase the terms of therecapitalization," the FMC spokeswoman said.    The increase to 80 dlrs from 70 dlrs a share was announcedApril 26. Reuter&#3;

(Bank of Montreal), which has loaned about two billionCanadian dlrs to Brazil, the largest amount of any Canadianbank, previously said it is also considering declaring theloans as non-accrual in second quarter results.    Under Canadian guidlines, loans are classified asnon-accrual when there are indications the bank will loseinterest or principal on the loan or when it believes it willbe difficult to fully settle the account within a reasonableperiod.    Several U.S. banks have already announced they plan toplace their loans to Brazil on non-accrual lists.    Fullerton also said Canadian Imperial still plans to enterthe brokerage business this year after the federal governmentintroduces laws that will let banks expand their actitivities.    "We'll be looking at anything in the Canadian market atthis point in time--from the very biggest (brokerage company)to the very smallest," Fullerton told reporters.

Between December 1985 and November 1986,the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons ofBrazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.    Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallontariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.    An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its finalreport on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.    Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order andtransmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entriesdating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessingduties, Vastagh said.    He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,including three major shippers, would be affected by thedecision. Reuter&#3;
reut2-016.sgm, TALKS FAIL TO HEAD OFF CHIP SHOWDOWN WITH JAPAN, Talks between the United Statesand Japan on alleged Japanese dumping of computer microchipshave failed to head off U.S. imposition of retaliatory tariffs,two senior White House officials said.    President Reagan's chief of staff, Howard Baker toldreporters here that he saw no developments that that wouldcause the president to back away from his plan to issue aproclamation on Friday slapping 100 per cent tariffs on a rangeof Japanese electronic products.    "I assume that there will be a proclamation on Friday,"Baker said.    Reagan's National Security Adviser, Frank Carlucci added,"It looks like a very difficult situation at this point."    Carlucci said that evidence of Japanese "dumping" ofmicrochips had been "fairly conclusive." The alleged dumping --selling abroad at below the cost of manufacture -- is said tohave undercut the technologically important U.S. microchipindustry.    Carlucci also said that although Japanese officials hadpresented statistics designed to show that Japan was openingits markets to American producers of microchips, "ourstatistics do not confirm this."    "Indeed, they tend to go in the other direction,"Carluccisaid.    President Reagan announced on March 27 that he planned toraise tariffs on as much as 300 mln dlrs in Japanese exports tothe United States.    He accused Japan of failing to enforce major provisions ofa September 1986 agreement on preventing microchip dumping andproviding American industry with fair trade opportunities.    He said he would be prepared to lift the sanctions whenJapan took corrective action on these two issues.    The dispute has soured U.S.-Jpanese relations as JapanesePrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone prepares to visit Washingtonat the end of the month for talks with Reagan.    Last Friday Reagan, answering questions following a speechto the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, said Nakasone hadendangered his political standing at home because of hiswillingess to try to eliminate trade barriers against U.S.goods.    He said he was looking forward to his talks with Nakasoneand "he has been most helpful."    Today Reagan was vacationing at his ranch near here. Reuter&#3;

U.S. District Judge Harold Greene held a hearing thismorning on the company's request but took no immediate action,according to a clerk.

reut2-016.sgm, TEXACO &lt;TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED, Texaco Inc has re-established some keyoil supply lines following yesterday's court filing forprotection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, saidElton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.    "Several companies say they are willing to start trading,"Yates told Reuters in an interview.    The company last week had stated that a number of domesticand international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oilshipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.    Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks toldTexaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texacosaid in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for depositsto cover transactions, it said.    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arosefrom an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. SupremeCourt in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> overthe acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco'splea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.    "Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as theycould," Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Courtruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and haltingsupplies.    "It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into anavalanche," he said. "Supplies were cut to the point where wecould not run the system at anywhere near capacity."    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been injeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortagesby mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Eltonsaid.    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, andAtlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards.    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> lastweek refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates todaysaid, "a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go onsupplying. They had cancelled last week."    He declined to identify the company.    &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oilcompany that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, alsohalted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.    But he added that Texaco expected to meet with theVenezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that keysupply line. Talks were also expected to take place with theAlgerians, he added.    Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit linesand oil supplies that are key to the company's business.    "It will be business as usual for Texaco," said MartinKlein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyerand Traub.    "Creditors are a nervous bunch of people," he said. "Butwhen the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation andwill likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company."    But other officials at Texaco were not immediatelyavailable to say whether discussions were being held with itsbanks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished. Reuter&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, DOME &lt;DMP> BENEFITS FROM TAKEOVER SPECULATION, Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd postedtheir biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stockmarkets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for thedebt-heavy company.    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange andgained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto StockExchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as highas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Domehas normally moved by only a few cents per day.    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlrCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, butDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also stilltalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believedto be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterdaystressed that its bid is "a Canadian solution to the financialdifficulties of Dome Petroleum."    "The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont&lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadianinterest in 1975 and could be getting back in," said Wilf Gobertof Peters and Co Ltd.    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that BritishPetroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despiteBP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percentof Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own.    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has saidin recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talkswith Dome.    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as "awfullyoptimistic," given TransCanada's offer to give current Domeshareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10dlrs Canadian per common share.    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferredshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, whichwould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanadawould own 80 pct.    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at thepotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. "TheTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,"he said.    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is "at theupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with anotherone billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available tosecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above acertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billionCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took onseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the companywanted to expand.    "There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capableof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on thatbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"Gobert said.    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that itis a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holdsreserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billioncubic feet of natural gas.    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acresof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, theheart of Canada's oil industry.   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres ofland across Canada.   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrsCanadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be thelargest ever by a Canadian company.    Reuter&#3;

"The message was they were far less likely to settlefollowing the bankruptcy filing," said Richard Pzena of SanfordC. Bernstein and Co, who attended the meeting.    Texaco yesterday filed Chapter 11 bankrupcty to protectitself from the 10.3 billion dlr judgement awarded to Pennzoilfor Texaco's illegal takeover of Getty Oil Co.    Texaco spokesmen said they could not comment on theanalysts meeting.    The company's bankruptcy filing freed Texaco from posting abond for the judgment pending appeal of the case in TexasCourts. Pennzoil said it would oppose the Chapter 11 filing.    "They are ready and willing to talk settlement," said oneanalyst who attended the Texaco meeting but declined to benamed. "But a settlement would be for less now," he added.    The analysts, a number of whom said they were recommendingTexaco, said the stock was so cheap that it might open up thecompany up to a takeover bid. Texaco declined 3-1/8 to close at28-1/2 today.    Pzena said company officials were asked at the meeting ifit would agree to a takeover, but offered "no comment" inreply. He said the company said that takeover talks were notbeing held.    "It would make a lot of sense for Royal Dutch/Shell &lt;RD> orExxon Corp &lt;XON> to go out and do it," Pzena said. "But theywouldn't make a hostile offer."    "This thing has opened them up to a possible acquisition,"said Alan Edgar of Prudential Bache Capital Funding in Dallas."There's a lot of volume (in their stock) and that tells mesomeone's messing around," he added.    Texaco was the most actively traded issue on the New YorkStock Exchange with just under 13 mln shares changing hands.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealermanager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.    But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mlndlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another partyholding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.    The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in anytender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealermanager services or for break-up of the deal.    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group ofinvestors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tenderoffer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.    The company's board has approved the plan, which wasintended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.    Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series Apreferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr ashare exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.    Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possibleleveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.    At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it wouldconsider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it saidit was told the company had decided against a buyout.    But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr ashare proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.    Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warnermanagement was asked not to take part in the new deal and itwas conditioned upon payment of the fees.    In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will alsoget up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses inthe tender offer.    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warneras a subsidiary with its current officers keeping theirpositions.    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it isconsidering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number ofsubsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.    All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.    Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debtof Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects toborrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mlndlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs ofnon-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynchand Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes toMerrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs ofsubordinated discount debentures.

reut2-016.sgm, PENNZOIL &lt;PZL> PLOTS STRATEGY TO FIGHT TEXACO, Pennzoil Co, frustrated by Texaco Inc's&lt;TX> decision to seek bankruptcy protection from its 10.3billion dlr court judgment, is preparing to launch a newassault that may include investigating assets Texacotransferred from its corporate parent to subsidiaries, legalexperts said.    Joe Jamail, a Houston lawyer for Pennzoil, said the companywould file a challenge to Texaco's bankruptcy petition sometimethis week accusing the oil giant of bad faith and ignoring itsfiduciary responsibilities to shareholders.    The action is almost certain to ignite a new round ofdebate between the two companies stemming from Texaco's 1984acquisition of Getty Oil Co for 10.2 billion dlrs, a companyPennzoil believed it had an agreement to buy.    "We're going to be doing a lot of things they may notlike," Jamail said, referring to the bankruptcy courtproceeding in New York.    Some legal experts suggested that a mud-slinging battle inbankruptcy court between the two companies might also provokeCongressional interest in whether the bankruptcy code is toolenient because it permits a profitable firm to freeze debts.    Texaco, which has assets totaling 34.9 billion dlrs, soughtprotection Sunday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcycode rather than risk having a Texas appeals court order thecompany to post a security bond for the entire amount of thePennzoil judgment.    Gerald Treece, dean of the South Texas College of Law andan observer of the litigation during the past three years, saidPennzoil was unlikely to prove Texaco is not qualified to be inbankruptcy court simply because the giant oil company has apositive cash flow and assets that far exceed its liabilities.    But Pennzoil may be successful in raising the issue ofwhether Texaco improperly transferred certain assets from thecorporate parent into subsidiaries unaffected by the bankruptcyfiling, Treece said.    "Pennzoil's lawyers are going to be like dogs barking atthe heels of Texaco wherever they go," Treece said, "I thinkpeople are going to be surprised at the level of intensity thatPennzoil will use in searching for hidden Texaco assets."    Jamail said Pennzoil objected to Texaco's transfer of anoil refinery and chemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas from itscorporate parent to a subsidiary on Dec. 9, 1985, one daybefore a state court judge entered the record jury awardagainst Texaco. Jamail suggested that the refinery and chemicalplant, valued at about 1.1 billion dlrs, were deliberatelyplaced out of reach of the Texas jury judgment.    But Richard Lieb, an attorney with Kronish, Lieb, Weinerand Hellman in New York, said Texaco could elect to placeadditional subsidiaries into bankruptcy if necessary.    In the petition filed Sunday, only Texaco Inc, thecorporate parent, and two financial subsidiaries were includedin the bankruptcy case. The businesses account for only aboutfour pct of Texaco's total revenues.    Mickey Sheinfeld, a Houston lawyer who representedContinental Airlines in an historic bankruptcy case that setaside labor union agreements, said the track record of thebitter Texaco-Pennzoil struggle indicates that the twocompanies could spend two or three years fighting in bankruptcycourt.    "The courts have been very interested in the issue ofgood-faith bankruptcy filings. This may prove to be a landmarkcase in developing that issue," Sheinfeld said.    Texaco, he said, was following the example set by ManvilleCorp, A.H. Robins Co and other firms that fell into bankruptcyexpressly to avoid paying large legal judgments. Bankruptcylaws were relaxed in 1978 so that a company no longer needed toprove it was insolvent in order to seek protection fromcreditors.    Texaco lawyers bristle at the suggestion that the companyentered bankruptcy to spite Pennzoil.    Gibson Gayle, a Texaco lawyer, said the company had everyright to seek protection from creditors, and that Texaco hadembarked on an internal restructuring plan in December 1984that required transferring various assets among subsidiaries.But Treece said the high profile of the Texaco bankruptcy casemay also put the company under an uncomfortable spotlight.    "What seems fair and what may be legally correct may be twoentirely different things," Treece said. "This may be a signalto Congress to do something about tightening the bankruptcylaws. You are either a chicken or a duck, just like you areeither bankrupt or you're not." Reuter&#3;

Pennzoil chairman J. Hugh Liedtke, on the MacNeil/LehrerNews Hour, said Pennzoil had offered to settle the disputealong the lines suggested by Wall Street analysts - somethingin the range of three to five billion dlrs - but Texaco Incpresident James Kinnear said it was the first time he heard thethree to five billion dlrs figure.    Kinnear, on the television news program, said Pennzoil hadtalked about four to five billion dlrs previously.    Both executives, who were taped in separate interviews,each accused the other of irresponsible actions in the ongoinglegal battle, which involves Texaco's 1984 takeover of GettyOil Co.    Yesterday, Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 ofthe U.S. Bankruptcy code, stating it was unable to continue itsbusiness because of the legal fight.    Liedtke said Pennzoil is prepared to litigate the matter aslong as it takes to bring the case to a final conclusion.    Lietke said he thought it would take about 18 months to twoyears to conclude the case.    Asked if chance of a settlement were out the window,Liedtke replied, "I've never thought that was the case. Ialways believed this could be settled. But it will never besettled as long as Texaco has the position that it has thateither you will settle with us on our basis or we will hold ourbreath till we die."     But Kinnear said, "we offered a big reasonable settlement."    Kinnear also seemed to confirm remarks made at an analystsmeeting earlier today where Texaco said it would only settlethe matter for far less than what it offered before.    "The offers we made yesterday won't be repeated tomorrow,"Kinnear said.    Kinnear charged that Pennzoil was "using extortionarypressure to deny us the ability to conduct our business." Hesaid that pressure forced the company into its Chapter 11filing.     But he added he still hoped the dispute would be settled. Reuter&#3;

He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by thecabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.

Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from theU.S. And the rest from South America.

reut2-016.sgm, ASIA GENERALLY WELCOMES U.S. NIGHT FUTURES TRADING, Traders in financial centres in Asiagenerally welcomed the first U.S. Night session of futurestrading which starts in Chicago on April 30.    Traders in Japan, Sydney and Hong Kong said they expectedthe move to bring benefits, but traders and bankers inSingapore said it posed a serious threat to the SingaporeInternational Monetary Exchange (SIMEX).    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) inWashington gave unanimous approval to the Chicago Board ofTrade's (CBT) proposals on Tuesday.    The CBT plans to offer futures on U.S. Treasury notes andbonds, and options on those futures, from 1800 to 2100 hrsChicago time (2300 to 0200 gmt) on Mondays to Thursdays.    The sessions would mark the start of the trading day, whichwould end at the present close of business the next day.    The proposed hours are designed to coincide with thebusiest morning trading hours in Japan.    But Andrea Corcoran, chief of CFTC's division of tradingand markets, said on Tuesday she expected the evening sessionsto attract primarily U.S. Firms looking for additionalovernight protection.    Traders in Tokyo said the night sessions were expected tohelp expand U.S. Treasury bond trading volume and enlarge dailyfluctuation ranges in Tokyo.    They said Japanese financial institutions were veryinterested in using overseas futures markets, but were waitingfor finance ministry approval to do so. Approval is expectedbefore the end of the month.    The foreign branches of financial institutions can alreadytrade futures, but in practice make little use of them.    But, traders said the timing of the launch was poor, as itis in a ten day period when Tokyo has three public holidays.    The Tokyo traders said because of the holidays littleinterest in night trading could be expected until after May 5.    Tokyo bond managers said also that participation could belimited by a lack of experienced futures traders in Tokyo.    The Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) hoped the four-hourtrading overlap with the new CBT hours would boost activity inSydney's eurodollar and U.S. Treasury bond contracts, spokesmanStephen Calder said.    The eurodollar contracts are linked to the LondonInternational Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE).    Calder said turnover in both contracts had beendisappointingly low since they were introduced last October.    He said the CBT move would broaden arbitragingopportunities for SFE traders.    "With a late evening lead from Chicago, there's also morechance that people will deal here in the afternoon," he said.    But in Singapore news of the CBT move was not welcomed.    A senior executive of a Japanese securities firm operatingin Singapore told Reuters: "Expanding global links betweenfutures markets mean that SIMEX must add Chicago and London andSydney to its list of rivals."    "LIFFE could cut further into the SIMEX contract, with a U.Streasury bond contract that can be off-set on the CBOT," theSingapore-based Japanese trader said.    Such a contract is expected later this year, he said.    Other SIMEX traders said local interest in the Sydneytreasury bond contract might be boosted if the Sydney exchangeestablished a three-way link with Chicago and London. LIFFE hassigned a memorandum of understanding with CBOT for such a link.    "If this link-up materializes, most traders are likely toby-pass SIMEX," said one trader.    Hong Kong commodity traders welcomed the CFTC's decision,though they added that local investors would have been moreinterested in financial futures.    "I think it is very good, because the move will help us toincrease our market share here," said Joseph Tan, manager of&lt;Bache Securities (HK) Ltd>.    He said that Bache, like many other local units of U.S.Commodity houses, had been participating in Chicago's rregularhours of trading for a long time and would like to extend itsbusiness.    Local Hong Kong houses also welcomed the move, but aspokesman for Shun Loong Co said investors would be moreinterested if stock index or currency futures were available.    Futures contracts in the local Hang Seng index have becomeincreasingly popular since they were introduced to the marketin May 1986. (See ECRA for Spotlight Index) REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, SOUTH KOREA TO CHANGE POLICIES TO AVERT TRADE WAR, South Korea has decided on major changesin its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducingthe growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding atrade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister KimMahn-je said.    Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exportscould make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase&#127;nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, whichmeans abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreigndebt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.    Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said thecurrent account surplus, previously expected to exceed eightbillion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billiondlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisationand rationalising exports.    He said Seoul would try to limit its current accountsurplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next fewyears, although trade volume would continue to grow.    "This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP(gross national product) from the current five pct level tothree pct by 1991," he added.    Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreigndebt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the endof 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5billion dlrs at end-1986.    "But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected toremain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lowerthan the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs," he said.    The policy change was announced two days before thescheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigefor talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.    South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateraltrade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.    Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swingin South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billiondlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mlndlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.    The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, rawmaterials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.    "The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), areconsiderable incentives given to increase imports," Koo said.    Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency."It means they could become interest-free loans if the Koreancurrency continues to rise in value," he said.    He said the South Korean won would be revalued against thedollar gradually, but added "We do not believe in rapid one-shotchanges in the value of the won."    The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen sixpct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986. REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, WORLD LENDING PATTERN CHANGING - MANILA BANK CHIEF, International banks have radicallychanged their attitudes towards debt and lending and debtornations will have to explore new methods of ensuring inflows,Philippine Central Bank Governor Jose Fernandez said.    "Commercial banks have tended to be rather difficult interms of new money for some time now," he told reporters at anews conference. "Within the world there are enormous changestaking place in attitudes of different banks."    He said the banks were no longer flush with funds from thepost-1973 oil boom and were reluctant to lend money.    "They don't have the same kind of money they used to have... They find their whole deposit base eroding," Fernandez said.Groups of major banks had decided that the international arenawas not to their liking.    "They wind up with 7/8 (over Eurodollar rates) and who wants7/8 really? It's nothing. They want to get the frills, but ifthey are not big enough they don't get the frills."    The Philippines on Wednesday announced it wanted torenegotiate a debt restructuring accord it reached on March 27with its 12-bank advisory committee, saying it wanted the sameterms as were granted to Argentina earlier this week.    Argentina was granted a 19-year repayment at 13/16 pointsover Eurodollar rates, the same historically low spread thatMexico won last October, while the Philippines, which hadinsisted on a deal similar to Mexico's, restructured 10.3billion dlrs of its 28.2 billion dlr foreign debt at 7/8.    Fernandez said the old type of new-money agreement, wherehundreds of banks were forced into involuntary lending by anadvisory committee that negotiated agreements with debtorcountries, was becoming increasingly difficult.    He said involuntary lending proved useful in the two orthree years since the Mexican debt crisis in 1982.    "But the present tendency has been that more and more of thebanks, specially the regionals or the small ones, have eithersold off their portfolios or simply by policy will not put upany more money," Fernandez said.    He said another disturbing development was the so-callednational quota approach adopted by groups of banks.    "Groups of banks by nationality have chosen to take a lookat what other groups of banks in other countries are willing todo and if let us say British banks wind up giving 99 pct ofwhat is needed and U.S. Banks give only 92 pct, then theBritish banks say as a whole they will pull out," he said.    "There are banks that have decided that lending is not agood business any more. They want to deal in securities, theywant to go into investment banking, they want to go into theturnover business rather than the carry business," Fernandezsaid. "We have to thread our way through a constellation ofbanks, all of whom have different objectives."    He said in order to survive, the Philippines would have totry and stimulate new types of inflows, "whether this be directinvestments, whether this be investments by institutions thatnow have chosen not to lend but to invest, or whether this bedebt to equity conversions."

The money could be spent onproducts which would have a more direct impact in boostingdomestic growth, it added.    "There's a lot of slack," a U.S. Government official in Tokyosaid. "All that money could be spent on something else."    Direct central government subsidies to the farm sectoramount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independentestimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.    Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farmon weekends to put their land up for sale for residentialdevelopment would also give a boost to domestic spending,economists said.    "Housing construction is the key strategic variable in theexpansion of domestic demand," wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professorat Kyoto Gakuen University.    Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reformto shift some of the burden of trade friction and economicrestructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto thefarm sector. Employers groups also want change. "If you reallywant to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not toraise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices," BumpeiOtsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'Associations told a recent press conference.    External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seekremoval of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their tradedeficits with Japan.    But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain wellentrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.    Although the full-time farm population is falling and thereare signs the LDP is paying more attention to urbanconstituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent onfarm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth severalcity votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.    The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reformplan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,the analysts said.    Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept thetraditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay fornational food security, they said.    Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed toimport liberalisation, but are more flexible about reformsaimed at stepping up productivity, they said.    Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specificpressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew. REUTER&#3;

He said the government and IMF this week agreed on apackage to reduce the balance of payments deficit, improvemanagement of public enterprises, reform tariffs, developnon-traditional exports and privatise public firms.    An IMF-World Bank team will visit Colombo next month tostart negotiations on details of a three-year economic reformprogramme. "There is a broad agreement on the content of thepolicy package for a structural reform," the official said. "Butin areas where the reform would take place, there would betough neotiations on how much you do and in what order shouldit take place," he added.    Sri Lanka is seeking a total of about 240 mln dlrs instructural adjustment loans to support the balance of paymentsand in a compensatory financing facility to offset losses incommodity exports.    Sri Lanka needs the IMF and World Bank approval of the twofacilities to clear the way for negotiations on requests foraid and loans from donor countries.    These include an expected pledge of 550 mln dlrs from from12 industrialised countries and about 240 mln dlrs in loansfrom the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.    Finance Minister Ronnie De Mel said in an interviewpublished today by the Daily News that there was likelihood ofSri Lanka obtaining all of that aid despite intense lobbying bypro-Tamil and human rights groups abroad.    He said that although friendly countries were stillprepared to assist Sri Lanka with concessional aid, Colombowould have to surmount many problems in detailed negotiationsdue in May, June and August before these loans are finalised.    "In these matters, there's many a slip between the cup andthe lip as other governments have learned to their cost," De Melsaid. REUTER&#3;

President Reagan is expected to announce later today theimposition of 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanesegoods ranging from computers and television sets to power toolsand photographic film.    The spokesman for the EC executive Commission saidrepresentatives of member states last Friday agreed a series ofmeasures to prevent Tokyo deflecting exports to the EC.    The spokesman declined to detail the measures, saying theywere technical, and the Commission would decide their precisecontent depending on the exact details of the measuresannounced by Reagan.    The EC fears Tokyo will step up exports to it of a range ofproducts including calculating machines, measuring instruments,small televisions, tapes and some machine tools as a result ofthe U.S. Measures.    But the spokesman said there was thought to be ample timeto put the countermeasures in place after the Easter holiday.    He noted the probable outline of Reagan's announcement andits date have been known for some time.    The Japanese manufacturers of goods likely to be affectedby the announcement are thought to have been stepping up theirexports to the United States in recent weeks in order to beatthe April 17 deadline, he noted.    They were therefore unlikely to have stocks available forexport to the EC immediately, he said. REUTER&#3;

But in an interview with Reuters during the flight toTokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw aninternational spotlight on Japan's agricultural importprotection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to openits markets.    "(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, butthey are not going to give us anything," Lyng said.    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessionsduring Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessionswould be unveiled later this month, they said.    "If there is anything of consequence to offer (PrimeMinister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him," when hevisits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports bypartially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last weekrequesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial usessuch as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, sayingTokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota forbeef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers wouldlike to buy much more beef than currently allowed.    He cited the example of a California company whichtransports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter tocircumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher thanthe value of the animal, he said.    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry PromotionCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrowfrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japanhas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan toeliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice byApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventuallybe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges becauseliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanesemandarin orange industry.    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate becauseimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. AndJapanese officials have said.   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buysurplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks inGeneva.

reut2-016.sgm, ASIA GENERALLY WELCOMES U.S. NIGHT FUTURES TRADING, Traders in financial centers in Asiagenerally welcomed the first U.S. Night session of futurestrading which starts in Chicago on April 30.    Traders in Japan, Sydney and Hong Kong said they expectedthe move to bring benefits, but traders and bankers inSingapore said it posed a serious threat to the SingaporeInternational Monetary Exchange (SIMEX).    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) inWashington gave unanimous approval to the Chicago Board ofTrade's (CBT) proposals on Tuesday.    The CBT plans to offer futures on U.S. Treasury notes andbonds, and options on those futures, from 1800 to 2100 hrsChicago time (2300 to 0200 gmt) on Mondays to Thursdays.    The sessions would mark the start of the trading day, whichwould end at the present close of business the next day.    The proposed hours are designed to coincide with thebusiest morning trading hours in Japan.    But Andrea Corcoran, chief of CFTC's division of tradingand markets, said on Tuesday she expected the evening sessionsto attract primarily U.S. Firms looking for additionalovernight protection.    Traders in Tokyo said the night sessions were expected tohelp expand U.S. Treasury bond trading volume and enlarge dailyfluctuation ranges in Tokyo.    They said Japanese financial institutions were veryinterested in using overseas futures markets, but were waitingfor finance ministry approval to do so. Approval is expectedbefore the end of the month.    The foreign branches of financial institutions can alreadytrade futures, but in practice make little use of them.    But, traders said the timing of the launch was poor, as itis in a ten day period when Tokyo has three public holidays.    The Tokyo traders said because of the holidays littleinterest in night trading could be expected until after May 5.    Tokyo bond managers said also that participation could belimited by a lack of experienced futures traders in Tokyo.    The Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) hoped the four-hourtrading overlap with the new CBT hours would boost activity inSydney's eurodollar and U.S. Treasury bond contracts, spokesmanStephen Calder said.    The eurodollar contracts are linked to the LondonInternational Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE).    Calder said turnover in both contracts had beendisappointingly low since they were introduced last October.    He said the CBT move would broaden arbitragingopportunities for SFE traders.    "With a late evening lead from Chicago, there's also morechance that people will deal here in the afternoon," he said.    But in Singapore news of the CBT move was not welcomed.    A senior executive of a Japanese securities firm operatingin Singapore told Reuters: "Expanding global links betweenfutures markets mean that SIMEX must add Chicago and London andSydney to its list of rivals."    "LIFFE could cut further into the SIMEX contract, with a U.Streasury bond contract that can be off-set on the CBOT," theSingapore-based Japanese trader said.    Such a contract is expected later this year, he said.    Other SIMEX traders said local interest in the Sydneytreasury bond contract might be boosted if the Sydney exchangeestablished a three-way link with Chicago and London. LIFFE hassigned a memorandum of understanding with CBOT for such a link.    "If this link-up materializes, most traders are likely toby-pass SIMEX," said one trader.    Hong Kong commodity traders welcomed the CFTC's decision,though they added that local investors would have been moreinterested in financial futures.    "I think it is very good, because the move will help us toincrease our market share here," said Joseph Tan, manager of&lt;Bache Securities (HK) Ltd>.    He said that Bache, like many other local units of U.S.Commodity houses, had been participating in Chicago's rregularhours of trading for a long time and would like to extend itsbusiness.    Local Hong Kong houses also welcomed the move, but aspokesman for Shun Loong Co said investors would be moreinterested if stock index or currency futures were available.    Futures contracts in the local Hang Seng index have becomeincreasingly popular since they were introduced to the marketin May 1986. (See ECRA for Spotlight Index) REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS, President Reagan today is toannounce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports toretaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfairpractices in semiconductor trade.    The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel ofexperts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.    Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffson certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computorsand television sets to power tools and photographic film.    The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to SantaBarbara, where Reagan is vacationing.    In his March annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed tofull enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provideAmerican industry with free and fair trade opportunities."    He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored thepact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in worldmarkets and opened its home market to U.S. products.    U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the Marchannouncement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  "wedo not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind ofaction that requires meaningful action."    Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.    About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.    Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president toretaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.    He has opposed the legislation, saying it would preventnegotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, thatexisting law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.    Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese wasas much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did notneed any new trade legislation.    The Japanese have complained that they have been honoringthe semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before theresults showed up.    U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring ofJapanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries andWestern Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that theJapanese home markets remained shut to American exports.    Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it wouldfile a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade(GATT).    It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation hadviolated the regulations of the global trading group and wouldapprove compensation or Japanese retaliation.    U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan wouldretaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war withthe United States. Reuter&#3;

The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to thenegotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night withTransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.    No financial details about the Amoco offer were availableand a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amocohad emerged the winner, the newspaper said.    However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Domecould be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe andMail said.    Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available forcomment.    Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Domesaid it was also in talks with two other companies, but refusedto identify them.    Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco andExxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary inCanada.    British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.    In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured bythe federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,the only Canadian company in the bidding.    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to wantto avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the governmentgave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks toencourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts andofficials have said.    A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to runafoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada isasking for tax concessions from a federal government that istrying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,analysts have said.    A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreignoil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.    Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-basedAmoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs.

It said Danners familymembers owning 171,538 shares have granted options to Indian tobuy their shares on similar terms and conditions.    The company said the Danner family options provide that ifthe infusion is completed, the partnership will have the optionstarting six months later and ending in April 1992 to buy theshares at the last bid or last sales price, whichever is lower.

But losses for the yearjust ended will result in a net worth deficiency at the end ofthat year of about 4,400,000 dlrs or eight dlrs per share.

The company said if it should fail to perform under thedeal, it could be liable for all expenses incurred by thepartnership.  If it does perform but the infusion transactioncollapses for another reason, it said it could be liable for upto 50,000 dlrs in expenses.    It said the Danner family members who have agreed to theoption have the ability to sell some or all of their shares tothe partnership around the closing date at two dlrs each.    Danners further said it expects to report a loss for theyear ended January 31 of over 19 mln dlrs, substantially worsethan it had expected.    The company said it also incurred losses in the fourthquarter on the disposition of nonoperating assets.  It said itexpects to report results for the year soon.

reut2-016.sgm, BUDGET CHIEF MILLER WARNS FED ON INTEREST RATES, White House Budget chief JamesMiller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might"overreact" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar byraising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recessionnext year.    "Our greatest danger is overreaction," Miller told newspaperreporters yesterday. "I'm concerned about the Fed'soverreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent datashowing a substantial fall in the money supply."    Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, publishedin the New York Times today, were accurate.    Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact tosignals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move hesaid could have "political consequences."    The White House budget chief appeared to be referring tothe effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidentialand congressional elections next year.    "My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deepsoup, and there is no question about it," he said.    Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower taxrevenues and a widening of the budget deficit.    Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. centralbank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means ofbolstering the dollar.    Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal ReserveBoard Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that furtherdeclines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardizeglobal growth prospects.

reut2-016.sgm, BANK OF FRANCE SEES PICKUP IN INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY, The Bank of France said in its latestmonthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup inindustrial production registered in March to gather steam overthe next few months.    Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lostearlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly toa firming of domestic demand.    "New progress is expected in all main sectors except capitalgoods where production will remain at its present level," thereport added.    The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March tradebalance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade forthe first time since June 1982.    While the automobile industry remained unchanged frompreviously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew andwas expected to accelerate except in the area of domesticappliances. Semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in allsectors.

reut2-016.sgm, YEUTTER SAYS JAPANESE CURB ALL BUT CERTAIN, U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would goahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.    Asked in a television interview what the chance was forReagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japaneseelectronic exports, he said "slim to none."    Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs toretaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to enddumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less thancost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.    Yeutter, on the NBC program "Today," said the United Statesdid not want to terminate the agreement and would dropthe tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.    He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officialsthey were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would taketime to monitor any compliance.    Asked how long that would take, he said "We want to see apattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that wouldtake a few weeks."    Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumerimpact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goodsbecause the items selected are also readily available fromother countries and manufacturers.    He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.    "It seems to me it is not in the interests of either countryto get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand thatfull well," Yeutter said.    He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but "that's more of apaper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see anyadverse impact on U.S. trade."    Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductorissue could be resolved before or during a Washington visitlater this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.

reut2-016.sgm, ARGENTINA SEES QUICK COMPLETION OF DEBT DEAL, Argentina's controversial newfinancing package should be completed quickly thanks to a widerange of innovative options in the deal, said Jorge Gonzalez,undersecretary for external debt in the economics ministry.    The deal offers banks a lucrative fee if they sign earlyand an "exit bond" provision allowing banks to sell as much asfive mln dlrs of their existing loans. Gonzalez also disclosedthat banks will have the choice of lending up to one mln dlrsin the form of a bearer bond. "We expect to complete thepackage very quickly," he said in a telephone interview.    By providing their share of the 1.55 billion dlrs in newmoney being raised for Argentina via an easily tradable bearerbond instead of a participation in the syndicated loan, smallerbanks could avoid time-consuming legal paperwork.    The bonds, currently dubbed "alternative participationinstruments," would carry the same terms as the syndicated loan- a 12-year term, five years' grace and an interest rate marginof 7/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, Gonzalez said.    The idea of the "exit bond" is that a creditor bank mayexchange up to five mln dlrs of existing debt for a new,tradeable bond that bears below-market interest rates.    In return for accepting a lower yield, the amount of debtconverted will be subtracted from the bank's exposure forpurposes of calculating its contribution to future new loans.    Gonzalez said it was difficult to say how many banks wouldtake up the "exit bonds" because no such instrument has beenoffered before.    On paper, however, Argentina's lending syndicate couldshrink dramatically because over 100 of the country's 350creditors have exposure of less than five mln dlrs.    Details of the "exit bonds" are still being finalized,Gonzalez added.    Argentina has pressed hard for a streamlining of thelending process because it has bitter memories of its lastpackage, which was agreed with the Citibank-led steeringcommittee in December 1984 but not signed until August 1985.    Gonzalez praised the committee for its cooperation in thelatest negotiations and said the resulting deal, which wasannounced by the banks on Wednesday, should put Argentina onthe road to meeting its economic goals.    "We believe this is a package that will help Argentine tocontinue on the track it has elected to follow - stable growthand equilibrium in the external accounts," he said.    Asked what role the Reagan Administration had played in thefinal stages of the talks, Gonzalez said it had lent "practicalsupport."    He did not elaborate, but bankers said the U.S. had pressedfor an agreement after Economics Minister Juan Sourrouillethreatened at last week's spring meeting in Washington of theInternational Monetary Fund to break off talks unless banksstopped blocking a deal.    The specter of Argentina emulating Brazil and suspendinginterest payments haunted policymakers and bankers alike, whohave long feared the emergence of a debtors' cartel.    "That was a feeling among people on the committee," onebanker said.    As a result bankers agreed to give Argentina the sameinterest rate margin as Mexico, 13/16 pct, on the reschedulingof 30 billion dlrs of debt, even though they knew this wouldraise the ire of the Philippines and Venezuela, which paid 7/8pct on recent rescheduling packages.    Asked about the angry reaction of the Manila government,which promptly said Wednesday that it would demand a spread of13/16 pct, Gonzalez said this was a matter between thePhilippines and the banks.

The department is required by law to wait 48 hours afterthe initial trade report to issue a second report on a "customsvalue" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurancecharges from the cost of imports.    Private-sector economists emphasized that the CommerceDepartment was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billiondlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.    A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in theforeign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealerssaid, that the underlying trade deficit for February had beenrevised downward.    The Commerce department would like to have the law changedto permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.    "My feeling is the second one is a better report but there'slegislation that requires us to delay it two days," said RobertOrtner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.    "But this has been going on for a long time and no one paysany attention to the second figure."    The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with arevised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.    The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthlytrade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in1979.    Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includescustoms, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparisonwith other countries that reported their trade balances on thesame basis.    The second figure, which would always be lower by deductingfreight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorablelight for the Reagan administration.    Ortner said he would like to see the law changed toeliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.    "We're considering it," he said, "It's one of those dinosaurlaws and I think it's time has come."

reut2-016.sgm, BANKS TRY TO CALM MANILA'S FURY OVER DEBT DEAL, Senior U.S. bankers are seeking tocalm the furore in the Philippines caused by the terms ofArgentina's new financing package, but a source in New Yorkclose to the Manila government said finance minister JaimeOngpin is in no mood for compromise.    Ongpin is angry because the banks granted Argentina aninterest rate spread of 13/16 pct, the same as Mexico won, justweeks after telling the Philippines that it must accept 7/8 pctbecause the Mexican margin could never be repeated.    Bankers acknowledged the political sensitivity of theinterest spread but urged Ongpin to examine the Argentinepackage in its entirety.    Argentina, for instance, is offering banks a 3/8 pctparticipation fee if they sign up for the deal within 30 days(declining to 1/8 pct if banks commit within 60 days), whichboosts the all-in interest rate it is paying on the package.    "You can make the case that the deal is not 13/16 pct," onebanker said. Another, referring to the Philippine debtnegotiators, said "The only reason they'd have to come back toNew York is political, not economic."    Ongpin has said as much himself, estimating that an extra1/16 percentage point would cost just 5.1 mln dlrs a year.    But the source close to the Philippines said Ongpin's angergoes beyond the dollars. He said the minister feels personallybetrayed by bankers who insisted Mexico's 13/16 pct was arock-bottom spread that could not be duplicated. Top U.S.Treasury and Federal Reserve officials had said the same.    The source said Ongpin is unlikely to come to the U.S. topress his case and was expecting the Philippines' bank advisorycommittee, headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, tonegotiate the spread reduction by telex.    Ongpin has not said the Philippines will unilaterally startpaying interest at the lower rate but has made it clear to thecommittee in a telex that he is not prepared to pay more thanMexico and Argentina, the source said.    "The Philippines really means business on this. I don'tthink there's much room for compromise," he said.    Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the issue.    The Philippines last month won an agreement to reschedule10.3 billion dlrs of debt over 17 years at an interest rate of7/8 pct, whereas some 30 billion dlrs in old Argentine debtwill be stretched out over 19 years with a spread of 13/16 pct.    Bankers said they were forced to break their word becausepolitical circumstances had changed in the past few weeks.    In particular, they said it had become clear that Argentinawas serious about its threat to suspend interest paymentsunless it got a good deal. Fearing that an Argentine moratoriumwould stiffen the resolve of its neighbour Brazil, which hasalready suspended payments, the banks, at the urging of theReagan Administration, bowed to Argentina's demands.    Some U.S. bankers argued that, regardless of politics, therich menu of options in the Argentine package makes itattractive enough to justify a 13/16 pct rescheduling rate.    "When they (the Philippines) see the whole package, theymay realize that this is not a Mexican deal," one banker saidof the Argentine agreement.    The Argentine pact contains several features that were notin the Mexican accord such as "exit bonds," an option toprovide new money via bearer bonds, a trade facility, onlendingprovisions and a debt-equity conversion scheme.    Moreover, Argentina is requesting only 1.95 billion dlrs innew loans, compared with Mexico's 7.7 billion, and is paying7/8 pct for most of the money instead of the 13/16 pct chargedto Mexico.    This line of argument cuts no ice with the Filipinos, whonote drily that they asked for no new money at all.    "The banks reacted on the level of politics to Argentinaand try to justify it in terms of economics, and now they'regoing to have problems with both the Philippines andVenezuela," said the source close to the Manila government.    Because of the Easter holidays bankers have not yet got anofficial reaction from Venezuela, which is also paying 7/8 pcton its 20.2 billion dlr rescheduling. But they acknowledgedthat Caracas, which was also told that the Mexico spread wasinviolate, is quite likely to demand a lower spread.    Bankers were more sanguine in the case of Chile.    Because it is under fire for its human-rights record, thegovernment of General Augusto Pinochet is unlikely to attractattention to itself by seeking to renegotiate its recent debtpackage, which carries interest of one pct, bankers said.    They hope that, once tempers cool, the Philippines willalso accept that reopening an agreement that took 4-1/2 toughmonths to negotiate will be more trouble than it is worth. Reuter&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING, The tough trade sanctions PresidentReagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot acrossJapan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair tradepractices worldwide, U.S. officials said.    But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at BrookingsInstitution, a think tank, said "a shot across their bow canoften result in a shot in our stern."    He said it left the United States open to retaliation.    The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan orderedon 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congressthat a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,and no new protectionist legislation is needed.    In the past year tough trade action had been taken againstthe European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beerand wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters thetariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a "serious signal"to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.    Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honoran agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets atless than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. Thetariffs were placed on items which were available from othersources so there would be little effect on the Americanconsumer, Fitzwater said.    Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action- especially against Japan - to end global unfair tradepractices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.    The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.    The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billiondlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for aboutone-third of America's overall deficit.    But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said thepresident is ready to fight them all.    Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that "I regretthat these actions are necessary," but that the health andvitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential toAmerican competitiveness in world markets.    "We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair tradingpractices," Reagan added in the statement from his Californiavacation home at Santa Barbara.    He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japanabided by the agreement.    U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that healready has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.    The White House aide said of the tariff action, "it wasn'tdone to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair tradepractice."    The aide added, however, "on another plane, it was anexample of how the administration uses the trade law to fightunfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a majoroverall of our trade laws."    But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was notin the best interests of the United States, and thatnegotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.    "It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route," hesaid, "because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions intrade."    Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for itspolitical impact across the country, and therefore its impacton Congress."    He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."    But other analysts said it made little difference whetherthe tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,and that the main point was that the trading partners were onnotice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.    Spokesman Fitzwater said "we don't want a trade war," but theimposition of sanctions showed the United States would act whenit had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

reut2-016.sgm, BALDRIGE PRAISES NEW SOUTH KOREAN TRADE POLICIES, U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigepraised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies butwarned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's marketliberalisation efforts falter or fail.    In a press conference after talks with South Koreanleaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intentionto regulate exports and boost imports "a very, very importantstep, the right direction for the Korean government to take."    The government adopted the new policies last week in thehope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.    Baldrige said the policies "showed an understanding of thefact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing byexports alone."    "There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growthbegins to take more of the load," he said.    South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus withWashington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars andconsumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billiondlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.    Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was "broad enoughand comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken forliberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, ifthe government is willing to follow through."    "We will be watching the implementation of this new policydirection very closely," he said. "Because of the protectionismgrowing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does notkeep on the same path ... Of steadily increasingliberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turnbackward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd seeprotectionist movement in the U.S."    Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister RhaWoong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specificproduct categories.    These included service industries, which he said were stilltoo much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers andcars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing thetariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make themsell for up to three times their American prices.    "We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there'sgoing to be trouble somewhere down the road," he said. "We arejust pointing this out."    Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without arevaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging formonths, Baldrige declined to comment. "We don't have any targetfor any particular currency, but we do feel that currenciesaround the world, if we are going to be successful as a worldeconomy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the variouseconomies involved," he said.    Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal forcooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures inthird countries. The American government would be pleased toencourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.    Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increasetariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige saidWashington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable toits difficulties with South Korea.    "I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,"he said. "It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything fornothing or just by asking for it.    "But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and theyusually end up with something good happening at the end thatboth countries live up to." REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, ADB'S FUJIOKA SAYS STALEMATE WITH TAIWAN CONTINUES, The Asian Development Bank (ADB) willnot change its decision to admit China as a member despiteprotests from founder member Taiwan, bank president MasaoFujioka said.    China's admission in March 1986 and the decision of thebank to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei, China' caused aTaiwanese boycott of the ADB's last annual meeting in Manila.    Fujioka told Reuters in an interview that Taiwan had beeninvited to the bank's 20th annual meeting starting April 27 inOsaka, "but the situation remains the same."    "The bank's board agreed to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei,China'," Fujioka said.    "We have tried to maintain our channels of communicationthrough the Taiwanese director, but we are not negotiating witha view to changing our agreement with China," he said.    ADB figures show China has the largest shareholding amongthe bank's developing members, with 7.2 pct of its equity.    Fujioka said a stalemate also continued with Vietnam, whichcomplained at last year's meeting that for several years theADB had unilaterally stopped advancing loans.    An ADB spokesman said the last loan of 40.67 mln dlrs wasmade to the then Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in 1974.    Vietnam said last year that only 23 mln dlrs of that loanwere disbursed.    The bank's 1986 annual report said of 11 loans approved forVietnam, eight had been closed, two were suspended and only onewas under administration at the end of 1986.    Cumulative disbursements to Vietnam at the end of 1986totalled 25.3 mln dlrs, or 99.5 pct of the total amount ofeffective loans, the report said.    "The situation (in Vietnam) is not conducive to bankoperations," Fujioka said. "Vietnam continues to be a member. Wewould like to help it, but new loans seem to be difficult."    "It's not a question of political instability, theenvironment has to be right for banking operations."    He said with the first loans made to India in 1986, andlending operations in China scheduled to start this year, theADB had now acquired a "truly Asian" character.    Although China's finance ministry had gained five years ofexperience in borrowing from the World Bank, ADB loans would berouted through the country's central bank, Fujioka said.    "It's been a very slow start," Fujioka said. "We identifiedthree projects (in China). One disappeared and we now have onlytwo left."    He said the ADB might lend China between 200 and 300 mlndlrs in 1987 for an investment bank and an energy project.    He did not foresee an expansion of lending to India.    The ADB in 1986 approved two loans to India totalling 250mln dlrs.    "There is a sort of agreement that our loans to India shouldbe modest and that the World Bank should be the major lender,"Fujioka said. He did not give details.    Fujioka said the ADB saw its lending to the private sectorserving as a catalyst. The bank's new private sector divisionin 1986 approved three loans totalling 11.46 mln dlrs withoutgovernment guarantees.    In addition, the ADB approved four equity investmentprojects totalling 8.15 mln dlrs. This raised to 15.18 mln thecumulative approvals since equity financing commenced in 1983.    But Fujioka said the ADB should not compete with privatebanks. "We have a narrow path to walk," he said.    He said he was happy with the decision of the bank's donorcountries to increase the ADB's fund for soft loans.    The fourth replenishment of the soft-loan window, the AsianDevelopment Fund , brought it to 3.6 billion dlrs, from 3.2billion, Fujioka said. In particular the United States hasmaintained its 16 pct share," said the ADB chief.    He said there had been disagreements with the U.S., Whichholds 14.9 pct of the bank's equity, over lending policies. TheU.S. Complained in 1986 the ADB was granting bad loans in itsimpatience to hit lending targets.    "I suspect there is some arm-twisting," he said.    "I find some developed countries are more interested in theprocurement side instead of the development side."    Fujioka said he said he foresaw increased sectoral lendingand a gradual dilution of the ADB's project-tied lending.    Fujioka said project lending was expected to drop to 63 pctof total loans in 1987, from 66.5 pct in 1986 and 77.5 pct in1985. He said sectoral lending was projected to rise to 20 pctin 1987, from 12.8 pct in 1986 and 7.5 pct in 1985.    He said the bank would try to reduce some of its liquidassets by repaying borrowings carrying high interest rates.    "On the other hand we must maintain our presence in majorfinancial markets," he said. "Why should we not take advantage ofhistorically low interest rates?" REUTER&#3;

To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reducedpetroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes.    Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pctto cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regionalexporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran.Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in1986 from 40 billion the previous year.

Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan, Lyng saidprotectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarminglyduring the last six months.    "It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive.We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatorylaws which would have very serious consequences for othercountries, especially Japan," Lyng told reporters.    Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislationappeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision,requiring retaliation against countries which have tradesurpluses with the U.S., Trade analysts said.    U.S. House majority leader Thomas Foley, a WashingtonDemocrat, yesterday predicted during a visit here that theGephardt provision will be approved by the House when tradelegislation is taken up later this month.    Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive thevolatility of the situation in the U.S., Where Congress isincreasingly unpredictable, he said.

Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market forexports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farmproducts since 1964, especially grains.    He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited landarea, is concerned about maintaining some level ofself-sufficiency in food for national security reasons.    But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would notnecessarily weaken Japanese agriculture.    Lyng pledged the U.S. Will never again embargo shipments offarm products as it did in 1973.

It suggestsliberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exportsof Indian goods by making them more competitive.    The summary said, "These reforms would result in (domestic)prices much more in line with world prices than is true today,and in a greater degree of import competition and exportrivalry than the nation has ever seen."    The summary said foreign trade must play a key role inIndia's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberalimports of capital goods would help modernise the economy andexpose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exportswould provide the foreign exchange for imports.    "The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the presentprinciple of unlimited protection for all indigenouslyavailable products and to recognise the role of actual orpotential competition from imports as a source of discipline onthe prices and costs of public and private sector domesticmanufacturers," the summary said.    An Indian official told Reuters the government wasdiscussing the report with the Bank. A final report with somechanges was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to givefurther details.    The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank'sfinal report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discussaid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June.    The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grewat an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and1986/87, which ended in March.    It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct ofgdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed bynational savings, mainly from the private sector.    India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowedto 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.    But the summary said the improvement was largely due tolower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertiliserswhich make up the bulk of India's import bill.    India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreignexchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, thesummary said.    The Bank's summary said there was little room forcomplacency in the balance of payments position.    It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87,Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs.    Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct ayear in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viablebalance of payments, the summary said.    It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued.India "might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting whileundertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives thatinvolve some political costs," it said.    "An example of such a policy would be the adoption of anexchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,"the summary said.    It said such an approach had been successful in countriessuch as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain thecompetitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduceimport pressures.    Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that theWorld Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boostexports. REUTER&#3;

reut2-016.sgm, BALDRIGE PRAISES NEW SOUTH KOREAN TRADE POLICIES, U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigepraised South Korea's new surplus-cutting trade policies butwarned of possible protectionist retaliation if Seoul's marketliberalisation efforts falter or fail.    In a press conference after talks with South Koreanleaders, Baldrige called the government's announced intentionto regulate exports and boost imports "a very, very importantstep, the right direction for the Korean government to take."    The government adopted the new policies last week in thehope of heading off a trade war with the U.S.    Baldrige said the policies "showed an understanding of thefact that this country cannot go on indefinitely growing byexports alone."    "There has to be enough of a change so that domestic growthbegins to take more of the load," he said.    South Korea had a 7.2 billion dlr trade surplus withWashington in 1986, thanks largely to booming sales of cars andconsumer electronic goods. It racked up another 1.4 billiondlrs in surplus in the first quarter of this year.    Baldrige said Seoul's package of measures was "broad enoughand comprehensive enough so that ... Actions can be taken forliberalising imports (and) increasing the domestic economy, ifthe government is willing to follow through."    "We will be watching the implementation of this new policydirection very closely," he said. "Because of the protectionismgrowing in the U.S., We see a real problem if Korea does notkeep on the same path ... Of steadily increasingliberalisation.... If that should falter or fail or turnbackward, I'm as sure as I'm standing here that we'd seeprotectionist movement in the U.S."    Baldrige said he and South Korean Trade Minister RhaWoong-bae spent much time discussing trade problems in specificproduct categories.    These included service industries, which he said were stilltoo much of a closed sector in South Korea, and computers andcars. Baldrige said he urged speedy action on removing thetariffs and taxes on imported U.S. Cars which can make themsell for up to three times their American prices.    "We want to stop that. With this sort of thing, there'sgoing to be trouble somewhere down the road," he said. "We arejust pointing this out."    Asked if Seoul's measures could succeed without arevaluation of the won, which Washington has been urging formonths, Baldrige declined to comment. "We don't have any targetfor any particular currency, but we do feel that currenciesaround the world, if we are going to be successful as a worldeconomy, have to reflect the fundamentals of the variouseconomies involved," he said.    Baldrige said he had agreed to Rha's proposal forcooperation on forming U.S.-South Korean joint ventures inthird countries. The American government would be pleased toencourage U.S. Firms to get involved, he added.    Commenting on President Reagan's decision to increasetariffs on certain Japanese imports to the U.S., Baldrige saidWashington's trade problems with Japan were not comparable toits difficulties with South Korea.    "I think the attitude in Korea is both reasonable and fair,"he said. "It's a firm attitude. We don't get anything fornothing or just by asking for it.    "But our negotiations are friendly and reasonable and theyusually end up with something good happening at the end thatboth countries live up to." REUTER&#3;
reut2-016.sgm, BLACK POLICEMAN KILLED, 70 HURT IN SOWETO ATTACK, A black policeman was killed and70 were injured when a bomb was lobbed onto a parade ground inSouth Africa's biggest black township of Soweto this morning,the government said.    The device was thrown from a passing vehicle as traineetownship policemen from all over South Africa were on parade atthe Tladi police training centre, the government's Bureau forInformation said.    Ten officers were seriously wounded and 60 suffered slightinjuries, it said.    A bureau spokesman said the type of explosive device usedwas not known and no arrests had been made.    The government has blamed a spate of limpet mine blasts inSouth African cities in recent months on the outlawed AfricanNational Congress (ANC), fighting a low-level guerrilla waragainst white domination in South Africa.    The municipal police, who perform security duties in blacktownships, have been a main target of black militants in thepast three years of political unrest which has claimed some2,400 lives.    Many black policemen have been forced to live in compoundson the outskirts of townships after their homes were attacked.    Today's attack, one of the most daring since a nationalstate of emergency was declared last June, came as police andtroops deployed at railway stations to stop attacks on trainslinked to a bitter strike by black transport workers.    Foreign Minister Pik Botha has alleged that the ANC isplanning a campaign of violence in the run-up to thewhites-only general election next month. Security is a majorelection issue, with extreme right-wingers accusing thegovernment of being soft in the face of a "revolutionaryonslaught."    Botha warned neighbouring black-ruled states not to allowthe guerrillas to infiltrate South Africa through theirterritory. He said South Africa would not hesitate to takeaction to thwart the alleged offensive.    Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana and Zimbabwe denied Botha'scharges and said they were a pretext for South African attackson them.

reut2-016.sgm, TAIWAN PROPOSES TO INVEST ONE BILLION DLRS IN U.S., Taiwan's Economic Ministry has approvedan ambitious proposal calling for a one billion U.S. Dollarinvestment by private and public companies in the United Statesover the next five years, ministry officials said.    John Ni, director of the Ministry's Industrial Developmentand Investment Centre (IDIC), said under the IDIC proposal,Taiwanese firms would be encouraged to set up factories andinvest in property and securities markets in the U.S..    Taiwan's 1986 investment in the U.S. Totalled 46 mln U.S.Dlrs, official statistics show.    The investment was mainly in the electronics, food, serviceand trading sectors.    The new proposal, approved by Economic Minister Lee Ta-haiyesterday, calls for investment of 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in 1987,120 mln in 1988, 160 mln in 1989, 240 mln in 1990 and 400 mlnin 1991, he told Reuters.    It will be discussed soon by officials of the FinanceMinistry, the Central Bank and the Council for EconomicPlanning and Development before being submitted to the cabinetfor final approval, he said.    "This is the first ambitious proposal with governmentinitiatives to encourage our businessmen to invest in America,"Lee said.    He said government incentives to prospective Taiwaneseinvestors would include bank loans and a five-year income taxholiday. Applications for investing in the U.S. Would also besimplified.    A ministry spokesman told reporters the proposed investmentwould be helpful in creating job opportunities for Americansand avoiding U.S. Import quotas or restrictions on Taiwaneseproducts.    The plan will also help reduce Taiwan's trade surplus withthe U.S., Which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in1986, up from 10.2 billion in 1985, the spokesman said.    The rising surplus has enabled Taiwan to accumulate some 54billion U.S. Dlrs in foreign exchange reserves.

reut2-016.sgm, ADB'S FUJIOKA SAYS STALEMATE WITH TAIWAN CONTINUES, The Asian Development Bank (ADB) willnot change its decision to admit China as a member despiteprotests from founder member Taiwan, bank president MasaoFujioka said.    China's admission in March 1986 and the decision of thebank to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei, China' caused aTaiwanese boycott of the ADB's last annual meeting in Manila.    Fujioka told Reuters in an interview that Taiwan had beeninvited to the bank's 20th annual meeting starting April 27 inOsaka, "but the situation remains the same."    "The bank's board agreed to change Taiwan's name to 'Taipei,China'," Fujioka said.    "We have tried to maintain our channels of communicationthrough the Taiwanese director, but we are not negotiating witha view to changing our agreement with China," he said.    ADB figures show China has the largest shareholding amongthe bank's developing members, with 7.2 pct of its equity.    Fujioka said a stalemate also continued with Vietnam, whichcomplained at last year's meeting that for several years theADB had unilaterally stopped advancing loans.    An ADB spokesman said the last loan of 40.67 mln dlrs wasmade to the then Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in 1974.    Vietnam said last year that only 23 mln dlrs of that loanwere disbursed.    The bank's 1986 annual report said of 11 loans approved forVietnam, eight had been closed, two were suspended and only onewas under administration at the end of 1986.    Cumulative disbursements to Vietnam at the end of 1986totalled 25.3 mln dlrs, or 99.5 pct of the total amount ofeffective loans, the report said.    "The situation (in Vietnam) is not conducive to bankoperations," Fujioka said. "Vietnam continues to be a member. Wewould like to help it, but new loans seem to be difficult."    "It's not a question of political instability, theenvironment has to be right for banking operations."    He said with the first loans made to India in 1986, andlending operations in China scheduled to start this year, theADB had now acquired a "truly Asian" character.    Although China's finance ministry had gained five years ofexperience in borrowing from the World Bank, ADB loans would berouted through the country's central bank, Fujioka said.    "It's been a very slow start," Fujioka said. "We identifiedthree projects (in China). One disappeared and we now have onlytwo left."    He said the ADB might lend China between 200 and 300 mlndlrs in 1987 for an investment bank and an energy project.    He did not foresee an expansion of lending to India.    The ADB in 1986 approved two loans to India totalling 250mln dlrs.    "There is a sort of agreement that our loans to India shouldbe modest and that the World Bank should be the major lender,"Fujioka said. He did not give details. Reuter&#3;

"The sense of crisis among the Japanese public as well asthe government is increasing," Deputy Director General HiroshiHirabayashi told reporters. "The need to accelerate the efforts(to restructure the economy) is well recognized."    Hirabayashi said that gradual progress had been made torefocus the Japanese economy, but admitted that it might notseem all that spectacular to foreign observers.    Difficulties had been encountered in implementing theso-called Maekawa report since it was unveiled a year ago, hesaid. But, he added, foreign governments should appreciate theefforts that have been made.    The report, named for its principal author, former Bank ofJapan governor Haruo Maekawa, called for a shift in Japan'seconomy away from its dependence on exports for growth. TheJapanese cabinet today reviewed progress made since itsrelease.    According to Hirabayashi, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasonetold his fellow ministers that Japan must follow the directionset out by Maekawa and urged them to make efforts to achieveit.    Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari added that not enough hadbeen done to publicize the action Japan was taking to refocusits economy.    Listing some of those actions, Hirabayashi said imports ofmanufactured goods have increased, interest rates have fallen,and coal, steel and non-ferrous metal output have been reduced.    He expressed hope that Japan will act more quickly in thefuture to implement the report and scoffed at a suggestion thatit would take ten years for Maekawa's goals to be met.

reut2-016.sgm, SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS INDIANA TAKEOVER LAW, The Supreme Court, in a 6-3decision, ruled that an Indiana law aimed at protectingcompanies from hostile takeovers by out-of-state businesses isconstitutional.    The high court justices reversed a ruling by a U.S. Courtof Appeals in Chicago that struck down the 1986 control-shareacquisition law.    The case involved a hostile takeover bid by Dynamics Corpof America against CTS Corp, based in Elkhart, Ind.    Dynamics made a tender offer in 1985 for one million sharesto bring its holdings of CTS stock to 27.5 pct of the company'stotal.       After CTS invoked the state law, Dynamics filed a lawsuitchallenging the constitutionality of the measure.    One effect of the law is to impose a 50-day delay on thetender offer at the option of the target company.    It also requires that the acquisition for control shares inan Indiana corporation does not include voting rights unless amajority of all pre-existing shareholders so agree at theirnext regularly scheduled meeting.    Justice Lewis Powell, writing for the court majority, heldthat the state law was not pre-empted by federal securitieslaw.       "The Indiana Act protects independent shareholders from thecoercive aspects of tender offers by allowing them to vote as agroup," he said.    He acknowledged that the law may delay some tender offersand may decrease the number of successful tender offers forIndiana corporations.    But he said the law does not discriminate againstinterstate commerce and was justified by the state's interestsin protecting shareholders.    Reuter&#3;

Chief executive William James told reporters after theannual meeting that "I would hope that the loss for the yearcertainly wouldn't be a high as the loss for the first quarter.In other words we are going to make money from here on in."    Falconbridge last year made a first quarter operating lossof 17.1 mln dlrs and a full-year operating loss of 15.5 mlndlrs.

Falconbridge records its cash and accountsreceivable in U.S. dollars, with the Canadian dollar equivalentdecreasing as the U.S. dollar falls.    He said the first quarter loss also stemmed from weakernickel and ferronickel prices and lower production at thecompany's Sudbury, Ontario nickel operations and at some KiddCreek operations. Falconbridge anticipates higher productionthrough the rest of the year and higher average prices thisyear for precious metals, James added, without elaborating.
