House member approved a measure that would requireSecretary of State George Shultz to enter into talks with Japanon increasing Japanese defense spending to at least 3 pct ofits gross national product.    The measure, passed during consideration of the 1988-89State Department funding bill would not require an increase,but legislators called on Japan to spend more on defense. TheSenate must approve the measure before it becomes law.    "We don't have to bash the Japanese. We have to show themhow to share the burden of the defense of the free world," saidRep. Robert Dornan, a California Republican.    The amendment calls on Shultz to enter into talks withJapan with the aim of reaching agreement on one of twoalternatives: either Japan can spend 3 pct of its GNP ondefense by itself or give the equivalent amount of money to theUnited States as a kind of security fee.

reut2-019.sgm, AUSTRALIA SET TO GROW, BUT UNEMPLOYMENT MAY RISE, Australia's economy should manage modestgrowth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown butunemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    The organisation's latest half-yearly report says GrossDomestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pctin 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will behelped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demandfollowing tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.    The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumerprices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.    The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightlyand could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.    While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growthforecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.    The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economicgrowth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which isstruggling to recover from a major economic crisis.    The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,should again show growth over the next two years, rising by0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988. Reuter&#3;
reut2-019.sgm, SQUIBB &lt;SQB> SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS, Robert Fildes, president and chiefexecutive of Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corpis not interested in buying Cetus.    Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus afive pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.    "This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a majormajority holder in Cetus," Fildes told Reuters in an interview."Squibb has not approached us with any indication that theywant to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kindof arrangement," said Fildes.    Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late commentsby Fildes.    Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the onlyone to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK>and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, butneither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.    Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnosticproducts and with Grace to develop agricultural products.    Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to developnew biotechnology products in several fields.       As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets butnot in North American and Western Europe.    "We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understoodthat Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business inNorth America and Europe," said Fildes.    He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has amajor joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of itsown in that market.       Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements withpharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its ownbusiness. Many large corporations have invested in smallbiotech firms.    But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has madein biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetusbecause it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationshipwith a large number of other biotechnology companies."       Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drugareas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to "keep thebiggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."    Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used tobroaden the company's reach in such big money making areasas the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatorymarkets.    Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' researchover the next five years.       "Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research anddevelopment to make it happen, while the equity position partof the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of thispartnership," said Fildes.

reut2-019.sgm, CANADA TO INCREASE CORPORATE TAX REVENUES, Canada will increase corporate taxrevenues by about five billion dlrs over the next five years bybroadening the tax base and allowing fewer exemptions, financeminister Michael Wilson said.     As Wilson previously promised, he said corporations willbear an increased tax burden, despite new measures to loweroverall tax rates.     Increased corporate revenues will result from broadeningthe tax base and eliminating special tax exemptions.     "The jobs of many Canadians depend on a corporate incometax system that is competitive with other countries,particularly the United States," Wilson said in a preparedspeech to the House of Commons.     "And it (tax reform) will ensure that profitablecorporations carry a bigger share of the total tax burden," headded.     Federal tax revenue from corporations will increase by 470mln dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1988, 410 mln dlrsin fiscal 1989 and 1.19 billion dlrs in fiscal 1990, accordingto documents tabled with Wilson's speech. Reuter&#3;
reut2-019.sgm, CANADA FINANCIAL TAX RATE INCREASED, The average tax rate for Canadianfinancial insitutions will increase to 21.3 pct from 14.5 pctunder the new tax reform package, the federal financedepartment said.     The amount of financial institutions' income that is taxedwill also increase to 74.0 pct from 48.7 pct, it said indocuments tabled with finance minister Michael Wilson'sprepared speech to the House of Commons.     Under Wilson's plan, the federal government will collect1.36 billion dlrs more over the next five years from financialinsitutions, including banks, trust mortgage and life insurancecompanies, according to finance department documents.     Financial institutions "are going to complain, but webelieve the changes are appropriate and affordable," said onefinance department official who asked not to be identified.     Ottawa will collect more revenue from financialinstitutions by reducing the amount of reserves they can deductfrom taxes, which "will broaden the tax base for this low taxpaying sector," the finance department said.     Among the changes, chartered banks will no longer be ableto use a five-year averaging formula to calculate loan lossesthat may be deducted for tax purposes.     Effective June 17, 1987, banks will deduct bad or doubtfulloans during the year they are incurred.     The finance department said the impact of the newprovisions will be cushioned over a period of five years.     The changes are needed to ensure that all financialcompanies are taxed fairly under deregulation of the financialservices industry.     "It would be inconsistent for the tax system to continueto provide different reserves for tax purposes for institutionscompeting in the same marketplace," the finance departmentsaid. Reuter&#3;
reut2-019.sgm, OTTAWA WIDENS SALES TAX, STUDIES REPLACEMENT, Canada will broaden a federal sales taxlevied on manufacturers before scrapping the system in favor ofa broad based, multi-staged sales tax, finance minister MichaelWilson said.     As expected, Wilson did not include a new sales tax systemas part of his wide-ranging tax reforms tabled in the House ofCommons today.    Instead, the federal government will make interim changesto the existing sales tax to make it more fair for low andmiddle income Canadians.    "The present (sales) tax is fundamentally flawed. It is ahidden, arbitrary and capricious tax," Wilson told the House ofCommons.    The existing federal sales tax system hurts the Canadianeconomy by putting more tax on Canadian produced goods thanimported goods and adding a hidden tax on Canadian exports thatmakes them less competitive, Wilson said.     Interim changes effective January 1, 1988 will include:     -- applying the federal sales tax to marketing companiesrelated to manufacturers     -- levying the tax at the wholesale level instead of themanufacturer for a selected range of products     -- applying a 10 pct sales tax to telecommunicationservices, except for residential telephone lines     -- quicker collection of federal sales taxes.     To offset these changes for low income Canadians,refundable tax credits will be increased to 70 dlrs from 50dlrs for adults and to 35 dlrs from 25 dlrs for children, thefinance department said.     Ottawa is considering three alternative forms for a newsales tax, including a goods and services tax, a value addedtax and a national sales tax that would combine existingfederal and provincial levies into one system, Wilson told theHouse of Commons.     He said the federal government will explore thepossibility of one national sales tax with Canada's 10provincial governments. All provinces except Albeta now levy aprovincial sales of tax of varying amounts.     Wilson said one joint system would be simpler fortaxpayers and maximize economic benefits of tax reform.     If Ottawa and the provinces can't agree on a nationalsales tax system, Wilson said the federal government willconsider either a goods and services tax or a value-added tax.     A goods and services tax would apply at one rate tovirtually all goods and services in Canada and would includefurther increases in refundable tax credits for low and middleincome Canadians, the finance department said in documentsaccompanying Wilson's speech.     A federal value-added tax, similar to European taxsystems, would also be broad based but would allow moreflexibility to exempt selected goods and services, thedepartment said. The finance deparment said the main drawbackof a value added tax is that it would be more complex andcostly to implement than the other two proposals. Reuter&#3;
reut2-019.sgm, FALL IN CANADIAN BUDGET DEFICIT TO SLOW, Finance Minister Michael Wilson said taxreform will not affect his determination to reign inexpenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the declinein the budget deficit in the late 1980s.    "Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,"Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.    Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrsin the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as heforecast in the February budget.    And in the year ended this past March, the deficit wasexpected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.    Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal yearhigher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm incomesupport programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipatedrevenues.    But finance department documents show the pace of deficitreduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and thetransition to the reformed taxation system.    The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs infiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1billion dlrs in 1991.    Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadianeconomy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pctthis year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by anactual 3.1 pct.    Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at aroundthe current four pct level over the next two years. Reuter&#3;

Under the motion, which is used to introduce most financialtax changes, dividends on all preferred shares issued afterJune 18 will be taxable.    The issuing corporation will be able to choose between twoforms of tax, one that imposes a 25 pct tax on dividends with asubsequent additional 10 pct tax paid by the shareholder, andone that imposes a flat 40 pct tax on dividends.    "Measures to reduce the tax advantages of after-taxfinancing arrangements using preferred shares are a criticalstep in achieving the broadened corporate tax base required tofund personal income tax reductions," Wilson explained.    The minister said many profitable corporations, usingvarious deductions built up over the years, pay no taxes,although they are in a position to pay dividends out of theirprofits. Reuter&#3;
reut2-019.sgm, CANADA SETS WIDE-RANGING PERSONAL TAX CHANGES, Finance Minister Michael Wilson unveileda wide-ranging reform of the personal tax system that includeslimiting the capital gains exemption and a sharp cut in thedividend tax credit.    With most changes effective at the first of next year,Wilson also announced he was cutting the number of tax bracketsfrom 10 to three.    He said the changes will cut personal tax revenues by twobillion dlrs in 1988 and by more than 11 billion dlrs over thenext five years.    "Most Canadians will pay lower taxes because of twofar-reaching changes. A new structure of federal income taxrates and the conversion of exemptions and deductions to taxcredits," Wilson told the House of Commons.    The new tax brackets will be 17 pct on the first 27,500dlrs of taxable income, 26 pct on the next 27,500 dlrs and 29pct on taxable income in excess of 55,000 dlrs. The maximum taxrate is 34 pct under the current system.    In a major reversal of his own initiative, Wilson said thecontroversial 500,000 dlrs capital gains exemption will bereduced to 100,000 dlrs over an investors' lifetime.    Wilson introduced the exemption shortly after taking officein 1984 as a a way of stimulating investment, but it wassharply criticized by the opposition as over-generous towealthy investors.    The 500,000 dlr lifetime exemption  will be kept on thesale of farm land and for small businesess, however.    Also, the taxable portion of a capital gain will increasefrom 50 pct currently to 66-2/3 pct in 1988 and 75 pct in 1990.    The dividend tax credit will be reduced from 33-1/3 pct to25 pct and the deduction for up to 1,000 dlrs of interest anddividend income will be eliminated in 1988.    Wilson said tax treatment for registered retirement savingsplan contributions will be maintained but the phase in of theincrease in the maximum limit to 15,500 dlrs will be delayed four years to 1994.

reut2-019.sgm, FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY, New U.S. Banking data suggest theFederal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady pathand is not signalling any imminent change of course, economistssaid.    But they also said that if money supply growth remainsweak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 declinesuggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen itscredit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetarypolicy.    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced aforecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to adecline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrsto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 forthe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply hasfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,economists said.    "M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness," said Bill Sullivanof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator ofeconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concernedthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growthin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seenas better gauges of economic growth.    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, bothmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.    "Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current openmarket position? No," Sullivan said. "But does this mean the endof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowingsof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement periodwere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed hadtargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-daynet miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higherborrowings target would probably have been reached.    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness inauto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices hashelped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.    "If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fedeasing at some point," he said.    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay littleattention to weak money supply growth. "It has been a number ofyears since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in theeconomy," one said. "I don't think M-1 shows that the economy isfalling apart and the Fed should ease."    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be aprerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetarypolicy.    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term ratesfor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar andhigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and chokeoff econmomic growth.    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since lateApril. "The Fed has to determine if this represents afundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this givesthem more room to ease," he said. REUTER&#3;

Economists said the opposition, trailingbehind Labour in opinion polls, would find its chances furtherdiminished if its tax policy was a miscalculation.    The tax plan, unveiled by opposition leader John Howardlast week, is the cornerstone of the Liberal Party's economicstrategy to oust the Labour Party in the July 11 poll.    Keating has said the Howard tax plan would sharply increasethe budget deficit to more than nine billion dlrs and severelydamage Australia's economy, already overburdened with balanceof payments and foreign debt problems.    In his mini-budget on May 13, Keating said the budgetdeficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two andthree billion dlrs.    Porter, a key member of the opposition economic think tank,said he played a leading role in formulating the tax plan butnot Howard's proposed expenditure savings, which Keatingclaimed were distorted through double counting.    Some opposition members said there appeared to be errors,but a Liberal Party spokesman refused comment, saying thepackage was being reexamined.    "The whole thing is so deceitful," Prime Minister Bob Hawkesaid in a radio interview. "Howard has made a mess of it. Ifthey can't govern themselves, how can they expect to govern thecountry?"    Hawke, who is seeking a third term, said the opposition hadmade the election one of the easiest for him.    "I've never felt more physically and mentally relaxed(during an election). We've no problems at all," he said.    The latest public opinion poll, published in the MelbourneSun newspaper, showed Labour was leading the opposition by 12points, indicating a 66-seat majority for Hawke in parliament.    The Election Commission announced last night that 613candidates would contest the 148-seat House of Representatives,while 255 candidates would fight for the 76 Senate seats. REUTER&#3;

Suhudsaid.    The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raisedits share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yenin government loans to the company for an equity stake.    The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas EconomicCooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.    Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yendebt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciationof the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold indollars.    Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago toabout 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even ifprices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.    Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes ayear, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant,situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan. REUTER&#3;

Regularly heavy trading of more than one billion shares aday has sent the Manila exchange's composite index soaring to775.9 from 577.2 points in just over three weeks.    Brokers described recent trading as "frantic" and "hectic" astrading records were smashed day after day.    A total 2.6 billion shares worth 259.4 million pesoschanged hands on the main Manila and the less important Makatiexchanges yesterday, with much of the activity among centavopriced stocks, brokers said. The turnover was more than doublethe record of 1.1 billion shares worth 118.1 million pesos seton Wednesday.    Brokers said rising gold prices caused mining shares toshoot up three weeks ago, and other sectors followed. Shareprices continued their rise even when the gold price fell backto 450 dlrs an ounce, due to rising confidence in PresidentCorazon Aquino's handling of the economy, they said.    Brokers said Aquino's handling of the 18-year-old communistinsurgency and the maintenance of relatively low interest ratesalso contributed to the rise.    Blue chip stocks, such as those of San Miguel Corp andPhilippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT), have risen 25 pctin three weeks, and the trend is upward in the medium termalthough a temporary correction is overdue, they said.    Since the surge began on May 26, Manila's Mining index hasrisen to 5,700.4 points from 4,042.4, its commercial andindustrial index has shot up to 881.0 from 694.9 points, andthe oils indicator has increased to 4.1 from 2.9 points.    Market activity has been rising in spurts since FerdinandMarcos was replaced by Aquino 16 months ago.    One broker said he thought the Philippine stock market "mayat last have come of age."    Wilson Sy, president of Prudential Securities, a localstockbroking firm with Hong Kong affiliations, told Reuters,"Barring any unforeseen political events you can bet on thePhilippine market. It has shrugged off the communist inroadsinto Manila."    Assassins have killed 52 policemen, soldiers and securityguards in the capital this year.    Communist hitmen known as sparrows have claimed they killed22 of them.    Sy said Philippine stocks were undervalued in world termswith price-earnings ratios often half those in Hong Kong andone-sixth those in Japan. He said PLDT, which is also U.S.Listed, has a price-earnings ratio of about nine.    Sy predicted Manila's composite index would rise beyond1,000 points from its current 775.9 mark by year-end.    Other brokers were more cautious, saying Aquino had toimprove peace and order before investors could treat thePhilippines as they would Hong Kong or Tokyo.    One broker said he believed about 30 pct of the money goinginto stocks was now foreign, much of it from fund managers andtheir agents based in Hong Kong and New York.    Manila Stock Exchange chairman Robert Coyuito told Reuters,"If the peace and order situation really improved the marketcould move beyond a price-earnings ratio of 20 times."    "But all depends on how Congress performs and the localelections go," he said.    A new two-chamber legislature was elected last month and isdue to sit on July 27. Local elections are scheduled forNovember.    PLDT shares closed at 630 pesos a share yesterday, 30 pesosabove Wednesday's record close. PLDT share prices have risenabout nine-fold in 18 months.    San Miguel shares closed at 190 pesos, also a historichigh, brokers said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-019.sgm, CANADIAN TAX REFORM CALLED AN IMPORTANT STEP, Canada's sweeping tax reform package,announced today, is an important step towards a fairer system,but is not as bold a revamp of the tax structure as some hadexpected, economists and business leaders said.    "It's the biggest step towards tax reform we've taken in agreat many years," Merrill Lynch Canada Inc chief economistMichael Manford told Reuters.    "But the system is the same old system with a lot ofimportant changes, as opposed to a brand new system," he added.(See spotlight index page on ECRA)    Manford said changes introduced by Finance Minister MichaelWilson did not go far enough in simplifying the federal taxsystem. They represent evolutionary rather than revolutionaryreform.    "Overall, I thought that it was a more timid step than wewere led to believe," he said.    Wilson's move to increase money collected from corporationswhile cutting individual taxes "is probably an acceptable shift,"said Bill James, president of Falconbridge Ltd, aninternational mining company.    Wilson spread corporate tax increases fairly evenly acrossthe corporate sector, James said. "So it's not going to hitanyone too hard and we will remain competitive."    Wilson said in his speech to the House of Commons thatCanada's tax system needed to be changed to compete withsweeping reforms in the United States last year.    "The critical thing on the corporate side is that Wilsonmoved most of the taxes much closer to the U.S. System," Manfordsaid.    The federal government increased taxes paid by corporationsby about five billion dlrs over the next five years, butlowered personal taxes by 11 billion dlrs in the same period.    Despite collecting more corporate taxes, Wilson was able tolower the tax rate on individual companies by removing manyspecial tax exemptions and broadening the tax base.    Wilson's plan also reduced the capital cost allowance, usedby companies to write off major investments, which somebusiness spokesmen said will hurt business in the long run.    "That will affect some investment decisions negatively," saidLaurent Thiebeault, Canadian Manufacturers Associationpresident.    Tax analysts said for some industries it will take severaldays to assess the impact of the capital cost allowancereductions that will be made over a number of years.    As anticipated, Canada's opposition parties signalled theyintend to fight the new tax measures as they are introduced inParliament over the next few months.    "It's not tax reform, it's a tax grab," said Liberal leaderJohn Turner.    Turner labelled changes to the federal sales tax "a moneymachine for the minister of finance."    Wilson broadened the federal sales tax to includeadditional products and also promised to introduce abroad-based, multi-staged sales tax.    "It's not at all a fair package and Canadians are going tosee that very quickly," New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbentsaid.    However, economist Manford said Wilson acted wisely toprotect lower income Canadians by providing tax credits thatwill cut 850,000 people from the tax rolls. REUTER&#3;
reut2-019.sgm, TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY, Recent government moves to curb capitalinflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan'sforeign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollaragainst the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.    Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters thereserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past twoweeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against theU.S. Dollar.    Chang said, "The pace of increase in our reserves is muchslower now than before and our currency is getting more stable."He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surpluswith the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.Dlrs a month between January and May.    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan andWest Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.    On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings oflocal and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bankpurchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90pct of the value of a contract.    Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures haddrastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange toimporters and exporters.    They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollartransactions showed a drastic decline with some banksregistering a fall of up to 30 pct.    Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised againstthe U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanesecents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of fiveto eight cents in May.    The bank dealers said the central bank, which hadpreviously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercialdemand.    They said they expected the government to keep the localdollar stable in the near term to give breathing space tobusinesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise ofmore than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar sinceSeptember 1985.    The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,unchanged from yesterday.    Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,"It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflowis quite successful."    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slowerrise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure fromWashington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.    Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayedimports of machinery and production equipment because ofexchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange ratewould help boost imports, particularly from the United States. REUTER&#3;

Japan will invest 24 billion yen in &lt;PT Indonesia AsahanAluminium> in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already investedin the company. The government and private interests willequally share the additional investment, he said.    They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen innew investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project inBrazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.    The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans toAsahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, theofficial said.    Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the twoprojects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from thecurrent seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to bereached, industry sources said.    Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billionyen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia'sinvestment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct.    The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest anadditional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment nowtotals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51pct, the official said.    The sources said the rescue programs for the two projectswere larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan's desire tohelp develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and tostabilise sources of aluminium.    Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of itsaluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, theysaid. REUTER&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, JAPAN REPORT SAYS FAULTY REPAIRS CAUSED JAL CRASH, Faulty repairs and inadequate inspectioncaused the 1985 crash of a Japan Airlines Co Ltd &lt;JAPN.T> (JAL)Boeing 747 which killed 520 people, the Japanese governmentsaid in a final official report.    The clear cause of the crash was faulty repair work by theBoeing Co &lt;BA>, said Shun Takeda, the ministry of transportofficial leading the accident investigation committee.    But the report also criticised the ministry's inspectorsfor failing to carry out a full check of the repairs beforesigning the clearance sheet.    The aircraft hit Mount Osutaka, north of Tokyo, on August12, 1985, after a bulkhead separating the pressurised cabinfrom the unpressurised tail suddenly burst, fracturing keynavigation systems. Only four people survived.    A Japan Air Lines spokesman declined comment on the report.Boeing is expected to release a statement later today.    The report cleared the JAL crew of all responsibility.    In a separate set of recommendations, the investigatorssaid large aircraft operating in Japan should have fail-safesystems, but did not say how this should be done.    A press statement by a group of lawyers representingvictims of the crash criticised the report for not dealing ingreater depth with the fail-safe aspect.    The lawyers said Boeing had showed it believed the crashwas due to design defects by specifying two designmodifications to prevent a recurrence in a memorandum filed inKing County, Washington, Superior Court last March 24.    They said similar official recommendations for fail-safesystems following two air disasters involving DC-10 aircraft,near Paris in 1974 and at Chicago in 1979, had been rejectedafter objections from aircraft manufacturers.    The government investigators asked the ministry toformulate concrete guidelines for its inspectors. An internalministry memo earlier this year complained that inspectors wereleft too much on their own when making aircraft checks.    A Boeing team made repairs to the aircraft's aft bulkheadunder JAL supervision, and Transport Ministry inspectorsapproved the repairs without actually seeing them, today'sreport said.    The inspectors were unable to check Boeing's work becausethe part repaired had been covered by a seal, the report said.    Over time, cabin pressurisation speeded up the process ofmetal fatigue in the repaired bulkhead.    Boeing issued an official statement on September 6, 1985,saying the 1978 repairs it had carried out were faulty. It didnot link them with the crash. REUTER&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, U.S. SEEKS JAPAN HELP IN EVENT OF 1988 RECESSION, Senior U.S. Officials are looking to Japanfor help in buttressing the world economy in the event of anAmerican recession next year, Japanese government sources said.    During a visit to the U.S. Earlier this month, EconomicPlanning Minister Tetsuo Kondo was asked by both U.S. FederalReserve chairman Paul Volcker and Council of Economic Adviserschairman Beryl Sprinkel what Japan could do if the U.S. Entersrecession next year.    Although Sprinkel indicated that he personally did notexpect a recession next year, Volcker seemed to acknowledgethat an economic downturn was at least a possibility, thesources said.    Faced with with a huge budget deficit, the U.S. Has littleroom to manoeuvre on fiscal policy to counteract any downturnthat might occur in 1988.    It is also hamstrung as far as monetary policy is concernedbecause U.S. Inflation is already showing some signs of pickingup, one source said.    But Japan is also limited in what action it could take tohelp counteract a U.S. Recession without running the risk ofoverstimulating its domestic economy and pushing up inflation,the sources said.    Money supply growth is accelerating and interest rates areat record low levels. In May, M-2 money supply pluscertificates of deposit grew at a year-on-year rate of 10.2pct, well above nominal GNP growth of four to five pct.    Some government sources are also worried that the recentlyannounced 6,000 billion yen emergency economic package couldpush up land prices and the construction sector's inflation.    Public investment spending grew at a year-on-year rate ofabout 10 pct in April, but that could accelerate to 20 pctlater this year under the impact of the emergency package, onesource said.    The 6,000 billion yen package was generally well receivedin the U.S., Although U.S. Congressmen and businessmen toldKondo they wanted the measures implemented quickly, sourcessaid.    The Japanese minister explained that the acceleration ofpublic works spending in the package was taking placeimmediately, they said.    U.S. Congressmen were particularly interested in how muchimpact the package would have on reducing the bilateral tradeimbalance, a question which Kondo was unable to answer clearly,given the many economic uncertainties involved, the sourcessaid.    While recognizing that Japan's trade surplus is falling interms of volume, some Congressmen expressed concern that it wasnot falling fast enough.     But the sources said no one pressed Kondo for a furtherrise of the yen as a solution to correcting the bilateral tradeimbalance. REUTER&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS, Japan could avoid a sharp rise in thevalue of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. Andother nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, anadvisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency(EPA) said.    The advisory body said in its report that the yen wouldsoar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a globalbasis were delayed.    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall toslightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed torestructure their economies.    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cutJapan's current account surplus to two pct of gross nationalproduct (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a changewould slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annuallyduring the seven-year period to 1993.    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollarwould remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan'scurrent-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. Thisscenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.    It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economyand four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made. REUTER&#3;

Dashed hopes of a further cut in Japan's 2.5 pct discountrate cut and a growing conviction the dollar will remain firmagainst the yen in the near-term has created a measure ofuncertainty over the market's future, brokers said.    "Everybody is just trying to think through things and seeexactly what is going on," said a broker at Sanyo Securities CoLtd. "There is a lot of confusion," he added.    This uncertainty was spotlighted by violent swings in stockprices over the last two days. Today the 225-share averageended 462.43 points lower at 25,288.12.    "People expect a correction next week. They don't care ifthe market falls to 24,000," the Sanyo broker said. "There isalways enough money waiting to get into the market to fill anycorrection."    Tokyo stock prices owe a major part of their two-year bullrun to repeated cuts in the discount rate, which diverts moneyfrom bank deposits to the stock market and cuts the cost ofborrowing, boosting domestic demand and imports.    "Fund managers are restructuring their investment portfoliosto sell domestic-related issues and include a few moreexporters," said Prudential Bache Securities' Hank Sawa.    Tokyo-based foreign exchange dealers predict the dollar isunlikely to fall sharply in the near term, thus convincingstock market investors to buy electronics, precisioninstrument, machinery and some other export-orientedmanufacturing shares, brokers said.

reut2-019.sgm, THAI SMELTER FACES TIN CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTAGE, Thailand's major tin exporter andproducer &lt;Thailand Smelting and Refining Co> (Thaisarco) saidit may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because ofinsufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines.    Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales toThaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> unit, to less than20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonneaverage, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters.    He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to letthe temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exportedtin lapse on June 3.    The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct thismonth from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lowerlevels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aidthe tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.    Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet alarge portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100tonnes per day.    As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated bythe Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the yearending February 1988.    Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC toallocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.    The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however,because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a MineralResources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes latethis month, Yoot said.    The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tinduring January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago. REUTER&#3;

It revised its December 1986 forecast that exports wouldtotal 205,000 tonnes, citing low demand, the loss of U.S.Market share in the two main importing countries, Britain andthe Netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at apremium in the U.S. Domestic market.

A Moulinex spokesman said a "mutilated" copy of the report byParis auditors Syndex, which gave a poor impression of thecompany's prospects, had caused the stock to fall sharply.    Meanwhile, Moulinex said in a communique that it stood byits April forecast of a 1987 parent company net loss of 41.7mln francs vs a 226 mln loss in 1986.    The spokesman said 50 pages of the 200-page report,commissioned by Moulinex's staff/management committee, had beencirculated to several Parisian stockbrokers.    The Syndex report said the company's 1987 target would bedifficult to achieve, thereby causing Moulinex stock to dropalmost 13 francs in two days to 75.10 francs per share.    A Syndex spokesman said yesterday that the auditors were"shocked" by the leak of a confidential document and attributedit to "malicious intentions." Several Paris brokers said it waslikely that corporate "raiders" interested in a takeover bid hadput out the Syndex report to bring down the share price.

"Productivity is rising very fast, and therefore even thoughwages are going up faster than is comfortable, the actual unitcost of labour...Is not going up fast at all," Lawson said inanswer to questions on BBC radio.    "That is one of the reasons why we're doing so well inexport markets, for example, but we could do even better andget unemployment down even faster if there was a more moderaterate of growth in wage increases," Lawson added.    His remarks followed yesterday's news that underlyingaverage earnings were rising 7.75 pct annually in April, upfrom March's 7.5 pct increase, which sent the U.K. Governmentbond market lower and helped trigger inflation worries.    Lawson said he would not update his own economic forecastsfor the U.K. Until the traditional Autumn Statement on theeconomy.    Lawson would not be drawn on whether he will cut the basicrate of tax from the current 27 pct to 25 pct in the nextbudget due in March 1988.

reut2-019.sgm, CANADIAN TAX REFORM CALLED AN IMPORTANT STEP, Canada's sweeping tax reform package,announced today, is an important step towards a fairer system,but is not as bold a revamp of the tax structure as some hadexpected, economists and business leaders said.    "It's the biggest step towards tax reform we've taken in agreat many years," Merrill Lynch Canada Inc chief economistMichael Manford told Reuters.    "But the system is the same old system with a lot ofimportant changes, as opposed to a brand new system," he added.    Manford said changes introduced by Finance Minister MichaelWilson did not go far enough in simplifying the federal taxsystem. They represent evolutionary rather than revolutionaryreform.    "Overall, I thought that it was a more timid step than wewere led to believe," he said.    Wilson's move to increase money collected from corporationswhile cutting individual taxes "is probably an acceptable shift,"said Bill James, president of Falconbridge Ltd, aninternational mining company.    Wilson spread corporate tax increases fairly evenly acrossthe corporate sector, James said. "So it's not going to hitanyone too hard and we will remain competitive."    Wilson said in his speech to the House of Commons thatCanada's tax system needed to be changed to compete withsweeping reforms in the United States last year.    "The critical thing on the corporate side is that Wilsonmoved most of the taxes much closer to the U.S. System," Manfordsaid.    The federal government increased taxes paid by corporationsby about five billion dlrs over the next five years, butlowered personal taxes by 11 billion dlrs in the same period.    Despite collecting more corporate taxes, Wilson was able tolower the tax rate on individual companies by removing manyspecial tax exemptions and broadening the tax base.    Wilson's plan also reduced the capital cost allowance, usedby companies to write off major investments, which somebusiness spokesmen said will hurt business in the long run.    "That will affect some investment decisions negatively," saidLaurent Thiebeault, Canadian Manufacturers Associationpresident.    Tax analysts said for some industries it will take severaldays to assess the impact of the capital cost allowancereductions that will be made over a number of years.    As anticipated, Canada's opposition parties signalled theyintend to fight the new tax measures as they are introduced inParliament over the next few months.    "It's not tax reform, it's a tax grab," said Liberal leaderJohn Turner.    Turner labelled changes to the federal sales tax "a moneymachine for the minister of finance."    Wilson broadened the federal sales tax to includeadditional products and also promised to introduce abroad-based, multi-staged sales tax.    "It's not at all a fair package and Canadians are going tosee that very quickly," New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbentsaid.    However, economist Manford said Wilson acted wisely toprotect lower income Canadians by providing tax credits thatwill cut 850,000 people from the tax rolls. Reuter&#3;

This compares with 200 mln dlrs earmarked for debtrepayment in the year ending June 30. Sudan has a foreign debttotalling 10.6 billion dlrs.    Finance Minister Beshir Omar, presenting plans toparliament last night, put the budget deficit at 2.88 billionpounds, against 2.85 billion in 1986/87.    He said the budget would be the first in a four-yeareconomic recovery plan to be announced by the end of December.    Of the total set aside for debt servicing, Omar said 574.6mln dlrs would go to principal and 207 mln to interestpayments.    Sudan has an annual debt liability of 900 mln dlrs,Khartoum-based Western experts say.    Omar said last March it would be difficult, "if notimpossible," for Sudan to meet scheduled debt repayments of 4.17billion dlrs over the next five years.    He said last night Sudan was 2.6 billion dlrs in arrears ondebt repayments in the first half of this year.    The experts say Sudan owes 23 pct of its foreign debt toWestern government creditors, 32 pct to governments of Easternbloc and Arab countries and 21 pct to commercial banks, withmost of the rest owed to multilateral sources.    Sudan, unable to fully service its debts since 1985 anddeclared ineligible last year by the International MonetaryFund for fresh loans, has been servicing only creditors bannedfrom extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears.    Omar said government revenue in 1987/88 would total 3.9billion pounds. Expenditure was put at 6.79 billion pounds.    He said the budget deficit would be fully covered by loans,government deposits and other sources.    Omar said 375 mln pounds would be spent on subsidisingsugar and wheat flour prices in 1987/88.    He said some of Sudan's Western backers were witholding aiduntil an agreement with the IMF was reached.    Sudan, which owes the IMF 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears,is scheduled to hold fresh talks with the Fund in late July orAugust on reforming its economy and clearing arrears. REUTER&#3;

"But we should not forget that less than a year ago we wereintervening to support sterling and had some temporarydifficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase inbase rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy atthe time," he added.

reut2-019.sgm, U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES, More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyersfixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makesthe same monthly payment no matter what happens to otherinterest rates.    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels inyears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyerstrying to lock into cheap money.    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officialssaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the homemortgage business.    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., Theywere the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only afew years ago.    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as lowas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in theirportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct toinduce them to retain their accounts.    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or wereforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whoserates would move in line with the cost of funds.    "We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,"said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,explaining why his institution, for the time being, is onlyoffering variable rate mortgages.    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helpedhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lendersconcede they are being forced to undercut each other stillmore.    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlierthis week by the nation's two largest building societies and byNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition fornew business, officials at all three institutions said.    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates evenbelow those on the variable rate loans.    "Of course they are less profitable than other (variablerate) mortgages," said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, whichearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed ratenew mortgage loans.    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitableloans because, "It was just another way to attract people to ourmortgage product."    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixedrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans wasexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.    "Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage," she said, notingthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pctof its 1986 volume.    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that theyoffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interestrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made thelender is earning an above average return on assets.    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has wonthe benefit of cheap money.    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixedrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumptionthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market ratesfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.    Young explained that the company had planned to protectitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying acomplicated hedging instrument.    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectationsand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. Hesaid money market rates were too high to arrange both themortgages and hedge profitably.    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co doesmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. Thismeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bondand selling them to an investor.    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and moreefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating ratemortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popularagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage moneyover the past few years. REUTER&#3;

The so-called Spring Report, giving latest revenue andexpenditure figures and to be discussed by the Dutch cabinettoday, was leaked in advance to the Dutch press. The DutchFinance Ministry declined to comment on the press reports.    Newspapers quoted the report, drafted by Finance MinisterOnno Ruding, as saying unexpected rises in revenue wouldcompensate for excess spending of 3.1 billion guilders.    Ruding, putting this year's public sector borrowingrequirement 0.1 percentage point below last September's targetat 7.8 pct, criticised the excess spending but will not seekadditional spending cuts for 1987 because of the surprise boostin revenue, the report was quoted as saying.    Excess spending by the central government was put at 2.8billion guilders, while market factors accounted for another300 mln in unbudgetted expenditure.    But 1987 revenue was boosted by an unexpected 3.55 billion,including 1.9 billion in tax revenue and 500 mln guilders inincome from natural gas sales.    Ruding has said the 1987 excess spending will burden the1988 budget with an additional 1.9 billion and the cabinet hasalready pledged 1.2 billion in cuts to narrow the gap.    The cabinet is to discuss in coming months what furtherausterity measures will be needed next year to keep thegovernment on target for its 1990 aim of a public sectorborrowing requirement of no more than 5.25 pct of NNI.    Ruding has already met opposition from the Liberal andChristian-Democrat factions carrying the government majority inparliament to his calls for more spending cuts in the 1988budget to counter a slow-down in economic growth.

reut2-019.sgm, SPAIN PLANS TARIFF OVERHAUL FOR POWER UTILITIES, Spain's socialist government is aiming torestore confidence of foreign banks in its power generationsector by pushing through a complete reform of the industry'stariff structure, a senior government official said.    Most foreign banks have been refusing to extend fresh loansto the mainly privately-owned sector since Fuerzas Electricasde Catalunya S.A. (FECSA), a major utility, defaulted on twobillion dlrs of foreign currency debt earlier this year.    Secretary of State for the Economy, Guillermo De la Dehesa,told Reuters in an interview that a new government-inspiredtariff mechanism providing for automatic increases each yearwould guarantee the long term viability of the industry.    He said a bill would be sent before the Spanish Cortes(parliament) this summer, enabling tariff increases from nextyear to be set under the new system.    De la Dehesa declined to give technical details of thescheme, known here as the "Marco Estable" (stable framework), butsaid future tariff increases would make up for the failure ofpast adjustments to cover rising costs.    "The utility companies have a captive market and if they areassured a satisfactory tariff structure they will have the bestof all possible worlds to do business in," De la Dehesa said.    FECSA's debt crisis has caused concern among foreign andSpanish bankers who expressed fears that other utilitycompanies may default for lack of fresh funds unless confidencein the industry's future is restored.    Spain's 14 leading power utilities have massive debts, withshort and medium term exposure of 4,377 billion pesetas at theend of last year. A significant proportion of it is in foreigncurrency, bankers say.    The new tariff plan, currently being discussed withrepresentatives of the utility industry and Spanish bankers,would shortly be presented to foreign creditors, De la Dehesasaid.    FECSA's problems were precipitated in February when thestock exchange suspended trading in the company's stock on thegrounds that it could not meet its debts.     "FECSA was a special case," De la Dehesa said, "but the bankstook fright and extended the crisis to the rest of the utilitysector. We really did not expect this."    Much foreign bank lending to the utility sector has been onthe strength of a government commitment made to internationalbankers at a presentation in London in 1983 to support theindustry.    "I think if foreign banks were lending on the basis ofdeclarations by our energy authorities in London, they willhave all the more reason to do so when the new tariff system ispassed into law," De la Dehesa said.     "This is going to be a palpable fact, not just adeclaration," he added.    De la Dehesa said he believed that once confidence wasrestored in the sector as a whole, FECSA's debt problems wouldbe quickly solved.    A recently formed steering committee representing FECSA'sforeign creditors is due to meet FECSA managers in Barcelona onTuesday for a round of talks on rescheduling the ailingutility's debt.    FECSA's General Manager, Jose Zaforteza, told Reuters hethought the climate of the talks would be greatly improved bythe new tariff proposals.    "You cannot go far wrong when you are managing an electricalutility provided the tariffs you charge are sufficient to coveryour costs," Zaforteza said.    The General Manager of the Madrid branch of a U.S. Bankwhich has lent money to FECSA said there would be littlesignificant progress in the rescheduling talks until details ofthe tariff proposals were known.    "We cannot make any projections about FECSA's ability to payits debts unless we know what the tariffs are going to be," hesaid.    "If you make annual increases over a period of years offour, five or six pct, in each case it's a completely differentball game," he said. REUTER&#3;

The package, one of 11 possible tax reform scenarios drawnup by government officials, is expected to be discussed byministers in the coming weeks so that a government draft can bepresented to parliament in October.    The proposals, which would greatly simplify the country'stax system, include a cut in withholding tax on investmentincome earned in Belgium to 20 pct from the current 25 pct.    The reduction would apply to income from risk capital, butthe spokesman said this was likely to be defined to include allshares and bonds.    The package chosen by Eyskens is more favourable tofamilies with children than the present regime and would treatspouses' incomes separately instead of combining them, apractice that is widely seen as discouraging marriage. The taxreform does not encompass corporate taxation.    The spokesman said some 75 pct of the cost of the packagewould be financed by changes to the 258 tax allowancescurrently granted to diverse interest groups.    A further 14 pct would be met by higher tax revenuesresulting from the overall macro-economic benefits of thepackage.    This would leave a shortfall of around 20 billion francs,which the government would have to decide how to cover, eitherby raising indirect taxes or by making further budgetary cuts.    The package favoured by Eyskens, who has described Belgiumas a "fiscal Himalaya," is the least costly of the 11 scenariosprepared. It envisages three marginal rates, or tax thresholds,of 30 pct, 40 pct and 50 pct. This compares with 13 currently,of which the highest is 71.6 pct. REUTER&#3;

The NYMEX ordered Apex to deliver four mln barrels ofheating oil sold via a February 1982 heating oil contract. Apexeventually fulfilled this obligation but claimed damages.    Richard Wiener, attorney for Apex at Cadwalader Wickershamand Taft, said the company has not yet decided whether topursue its case against Belcher Oil.

reut2-019.sgm, GTE &lt;GTE> DEVELOPS METHOD FOR MAKING TRANSISTORS, GTE Corp scientists said theyhave discoverd a much simpler method for producing transistorsby creating an entirely new electronic material.    The new method, they said, consists of simultaneously"growing" metal connections and silicon crystals together toform one, three dimensional device with connections penetratingthe entire device.    Conventional transistors require many steps to make andhave connections only on the surface.    GTE Laboratories created "an entirely new electronicmaterial and device form, which may open up a spectrum of usesthat cannot even be imagined at this time," said David Decker,vice president and director of research for GTE Laboratories.    "Although still early in our research, we are obviouslyexcited that we have found a significantly simpler and, webelieve, cheaper way to produce an electronic device," he said.    Researchers at GTE created the new transistor by combiningand heating silicon and a conductive metal, tantalumdisilicide, so that the two grow together.    The resulting device has microscopic metal rods extendingthrougout the chips, creating a three dimensional transistorthat should be superior to standard devics in high powerapplications, the scientists said.    They said that, because the connections extend verticallythrougout the new device, it has a much greater volume ofactive material than conventional surface-mounted connections.    Decker said the scientists are still in the early stages oftheir research on the device, but prototypes of the new devicecompare favorably with conventionaly made transistors and showpromise of superior performance.    He said the prototype device also proved to be particularlyefficient in detecting light, which could open up newpossibilities in solar energy conversion, the development ofelectronic cameras and greater efficiency in opticalcommunication systems.

Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financialadviser, declined comment.    A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, saidthe rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt hasannounced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeoverattempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell."It's completelyinconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if theydrop the recapitalization," he said.    Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.    Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of aU.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought adeclaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011in light of the recapitalization.    Harcourt said in a statement this week that SalomonBrothers Inc &lt;SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in thecase, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amountof the debenture. In addition, British Printing andCommunications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs faceamount, Harcourt said.    Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If thecourt decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.    Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is notrequired to issue common to debenture holders who did notconvert prior to June eight.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,the New York brokerage firm said it bought the debentures,which have a face value of 1,000 dlrs each, in May and June asa regular part of its investment and arbitrage activities.    The conversion rights of the debentures are the subject ofa Florida court case, in which Salomon Brothers said it hasalso intervened.    Salomon Brothers said it rejects Hartcourt's position thatthe debentures are not convertible into stock as of June 9.    It said it would leave open a range of options regardingthe debentures, including buying more, selling some or all oftheir current stake in the market or in negotiated deals,talking with other Harcourt security holders, surrendering thedebentures if there were a merger or tender offer or convertingthem into stock.    Salomon said it would have a 35.8 pct stake in Harcourt,based on 39.4 mln shares outstanding, if it converted thedebentures into 21,978,000 common shares. The percentage isbased on the current outstanding plus the amount of stock thatwould be issued in a conversion.    But Salomon said its stake in Harcourt's common stock wouldbe lower if other debentureholders converted their securitiesinto stock. It says it has no idea of the total number ofdebentures outstanding.    Harcourt has said that Salomon and Mutual Shares Corp, aNew York investment firm, hold a combined total of 30 mln dlrsof debentures.

AFRICA CITICORP STAFF CHALLENGE DISINVESTMENT, South African staff of the U.S.Bank Citicorp &lt;CCI> said they will challenge its plans to selllocal operations and withdraw from the country.    Employees said they had written to Citicorp chief executiveJohn Reed protesting against the way the disinvestment deal hasbeen handled. They said that they were not consulted on thesale of Citicorp's local subsidiary, Citibank N.A. Ltd, toSouth Africa's First National Bank &lt;BCLJ.J>.    The letter, signed by most of the bank's 175 staff, hintsat legal action against Citicorp unless it reviews thedisinvestment arrangement.    "We are seriously considering legal action," a seniorCitibank employee told Reuters. "There has been no consultationwith South African staff and that runs contrary to Americancorporate thinking in this country," he added.    Citicorp announced the 130 mln rand cash sale on Tuesdaywith an effective date of July 1.    First National Bank's managing director, Chris Ball, saidhis bank was essentially buying the skills of Citibank'sspecialist employees and disclosed that the American bank'sassets in South Africa totalled only 15 mln rand.    Ball indicated that the bank's staff had been told of thesale and agreed to stay on in the bank's employ.    Citibank's staff, 40 pct of whom are black, have complainedthat the disinvestment accord bars local employees from jobswith Citicorp anywhere in the world for five years.    They say that this provision amounts to a restraint clausewhich is legally challengeable. This could threaten thedivestment plan, say industry sources, since most of thepurchase price, as Ball said, is for employee skills andexpertise and not assets.    The Citibank employee challenge is seen as more importantthan a previous, ultimately unsuccessful, challenge on jobsecurity issues by General Motors employees after the U.S.Automaker announced its pull out, because valuable managers andother key staff are involved in protest.    The employees assert that the Citicorp sale, unlike similardisinvestment moves announced this week by &lt;Ford Motor Co> and&lt;ITT Corp>, include no portion of South African profits forlocal employees or black community projects.    "We always thought they would offer a settlement to staffhere in keeping with their image as an equal opportunityemployer," said a senior black employee, adding "We had no ideathat the age of slavery was still alive."

reut2-019.sgm, LLOYDS PULLS OUT OF EUROBOND/GILT MARKET MAKING, Lloyds Bank Plc said it is withdrawingfrom market making in Eurobonds and U.K. Government bonds(gilts).    It said in a statement it will maintain an active presencein short-term securities trading, swaps and other treasuryproducts, building on its strengths in traditional foreignexchange and money markets.    In the statement, Lloyds chief executive Brian Pitman said"We have a relatively small position in these two overcrowdedmarkets and we have decided to reallocate the resources toopportunities which promise a better return on ourshareholders' investment."    With this decision, Lloyds becomes the second major U.K.Clearing bank to feel the effects of the deregulation of theLondon Stock Exchange, or "Big Bang," last October. Earlier thisyear, Midland Bank Plc pulled out of equity market makingbecause it did not believe the return justified the costsinvolved in maintaining and developing a market share.    Lloyds Treasurer Alan Moore subsequently told Reuters thatthe decision was taken at a board meeting earlier today and hadbeen under discussion for some time.    He said the move was not a reaction to any losses sustainedin the trading of Eurobonds or gilts but rather a result of a"strategic review" of the future of Lloyds involvement in thesemarkets. In the end, Lloyds decided these markets did notrepresent "an attractive return to our shareholders," he said.    He noted that Lloyds had not expected its U.K. Governmentbond operations would be profitable in the early stages,although he declined to discuss the finances of the operation.    "This is an overcrowed market," Moore said of the U.K.Government bond market, which began Big Bang with 27 marketmakers. Lloyds withdrawal now leaves the number at 26.    Market participants noted that Lloyds was the only one ofthe clearing banks which did not buy a jobber (middle man) orbroker before Big Bang.    Under the old system, the gilt market operated under aseparate system which involved separate functions for jobbersand brokers. Now these tasks have been taken up by marketmakers acting as both.    Moore said that one reason Lloyds decided to withdraw fromthese markets was that they could no longer justify thecommitment of capital that was required to maintain theseoperations.    He said Lloyds would make every effort to redeployemployees in these areas within the bank. REUTER&#3;

But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather hasboosted sugar beet growth.    Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beetdevelopment, Licht said.    In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plantpopulation is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainyweather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects arerated as slightly below normal.    In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool withheavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.    In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, itwas mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall whichcontinued to slow down beet growth and often made field workimpossible.    In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which wasfavourable for beet growth, Licht said.    In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouringbeet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.    In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,it was warm with showers over most areas and weather wasgenerally good for the emergence and growth of beets.

At meetings here this week, both countries were accordedterms that were more generous than usually granted by the Club.Uganda was given 15 years to repay its debts with a six-yeargrace period while Mozambique was accorded an exceptionallylong 20-year period, with 10 years' grace.    The Club said it approved of both countries' economic andfinancial programs and would therefore make a contribution toimprove their external payments prospects.    It said both countries faced heavy debt service obligationsand low per capita income, adding the solution of thecountries' debt problems would take a number of years.    The statement also said Mozambique's limited debt servicecapacity made borrowing from the International Monetary Fund inthe upper credit tranches "inappropriate."    No details were available from the countries' embassies norfrom the Club on the amounts involved, but last week theUgandan Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said he was hopingfor a rescheduling of 120 mln dlrs. Uganda's total foreign debtis estimated at some 1.5 billion dlrs.    A French Finance Ministry statement issued the same time asthe Paris Club statement, said France had formally agreed withGabon to reschedule bilateral unpaid debt amounting to about440 mln francs.    The bilateral agreement, covering payments due to have beenmade by May 31 this year, follows the Paris Club's Januarydecision to grant Gabon an extended repayment period for itsgovernment-to-government debt.    The ministry said French aid to Gabon in 1987, within theframework of the country's economic recovery program, amountsto about 1.67 billion francs. REUTER&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING, U.S. crude oil prices are at theirhighest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPECmeeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect anypolicy changes from the session.    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since theorganization's accord in December, have risen on technicalfactors within the market and concerns about supplies becauseof the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from theGulf.    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is tradingaround 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York MercantileExchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is itshighest level since January 1986.    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria'soil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna tobe brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and productionagreement may only need a slight review.    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmationof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due toa desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soonafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increasedtension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, pricesshould begin easing.    "OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreedto in December because oil prices are firm," said John Hill, avice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mlnbarrels in the fourth quarter.    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, risingfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and areduction in output.    "And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues totrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance thatOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price," said NaumanBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, suchas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.    "The meeting will be a non-event with no change in theofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, arecommitted to stabilizing the market," said Rosario Ilacqua,analyst with L.F. Rothschild.    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meetingin September to re-evaluate market conditions.    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in thefourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels aday and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, presidentof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at thismeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs tooffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominatedthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,producers receive less money for their oil.    "The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,"said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.    "In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not toproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore actas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a twodlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting," hesaid.    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.    "The wild card is the increased tensions in the PersianGulf," said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurites.    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have beenregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administrationis planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of theU.S. flag, with naval escorts.    "Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisislike this, and just general nervousness over an incident thatcould disrupt oil supplies drives prices up," Knuettel said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, FURTHER US DEFENSE WRITEOFFS LIKELY, ANALYSTS SAY, The tug-of-war over who pays to developnew weapons--contractors or the government--is likely to leadto more writeoffs by defense firms, analysts said.    Singer Co &lt;SMF> and Northrop Corp &lt;NOC> recently announcedplanned second quarter writeoffs related to costs of majordefense programs under fixed-price government contracts.    "It's a case of companies paying for things that in adifferent environment the Defense Department would have paidfor," said Howard Mager of Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette SecuritiesCorp.    In recent years, the Defense Department, DOD, has increasedcompetitive bidding for weapons contracts and has askedcontractors to pay more of the costs of developing weaponsprograms.    The moves have helped cut waste and abuse by contractorsbut have also dictated that the firms assume much more risk,analysts said.    "It's a stricter environment," said Anthony Hatch of ArgusResearch Corp. "Contractors are absorbing more of the cost andmore of risk and that's likely to be the trend for some time tocome."    The trend will probably lead to further writeoffs, theanalysts said. Programs most prone, they agreed, are theAdvanced Tactical Fighter, ATF, a new generation,high-technology fighter plane being developed for the U.S. AirForce, the C-17 air transport plane and the Light HelicopterExperimental, LHX, under development for the Army.    Other programs may also be affected, they said.    The Air Force is expected to order 750 of the advancedfighter planes in the 1990s at a cost of up to 40 billion dlrs,analysts have said. Two teams of contractors are competing fora contract to develop a prototype ATF.    Lockheed Corp &lt;LK>, General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD> and BoeingCo &lt;BA> are teamed in competition against Northrop Corp &lt;NOC>and McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD> on ATF.    The two teams fighting for an award to develop the LHX areBell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc &lt;TXT>, coupled withMcDonnell Douglas, and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX>Sikorsky paired with Boeing.    The C-17 is a four-engine transport plane. McDonnellDouglas's Douglas Aircraft Co is working on two test planes,and a production award for up to 210 of the aircraft should bemade by late 1989, a Douglas Aircraft spokesman said.    Under the government's new procedures, contractors canspend hundreds of millions of dollars on development and  typically recoup their investments during production.    But now the government sometimes awards production to asecond contractor who did not develop the system. GeneralElectric Co &lt;GE>, for example, developed the F404 engine forthe Navy. But two weeks ago, the Pentagon awarded 30 pct ofF404 production to United Technologies' Pratt and Whitney.    Such tactics have increased competition but the governmentnow risks decimating the industry by making it too competitive,said Michael LaTronica of Redding Research Group.    "Two years ago, defense contractors were their own worstenemies. They were not cost efficient," LaTronica said. "NowDOD has allowed the situation to swing so far back the otherway that you may be in danger of losing the defense industry asa national resource."    While the nation as a whole has posted trade deficits inrecent years, aerospace and defense has exported more productsthan it imported, he noted.    LaTronica and others said, however, that changes ingovernment procurement may be coming.    "I hear that the Pentagon is looking into the situation,"said John Diamantis, defense analyst at Pershing and Co.    He said that some small defense electronics firms believethe Pentagon will begin re-evaluating procurement policy andperhaps start paying more development money.    Redding Research's LaTronica, who still likes the industrydespite the probability of additional unforeseen writeoffs,said, "There's been a swing in sentiment. The defense bashingpsychology of the last few years is starting to shift."    LaTronica noted that one government official has recentlysuggested that the winner of the ATF prototype award should getsole production of the plane for a specified time.    The investments are large. The Lockheed, General Dynamics,Boeing ATF team, for example, is spending 691 mln dlrs just todevelop the prototype.    The danger the Pentagon runs if changes are not made isthat companies will hesitate to bid to develop a program butinstead will wait for a second source production award.    "But it may take a company going bust to really changepeople's thinking," LaTronica said. Reuter&#3;

Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. SyntheticFuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology atthe oil shale plant. In return the company would have beeneligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supportsfrom the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contractfrom the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidizedbed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat andelectricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investmenttax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the projectuneconomical even with government price supports and loanguarantees, Unocal said.

reut2-019.sgm, MERCK &lt;MRK>, SQUIBB &lt;SQB> BENEFIT FROM STUDY, Merck Co &lt;MRK> and Squibb Corp &lt;SQB>will benefit from a study that shows lower levels of bloodcholesterol slows the build-up of fat in the heart's arteries,lowering the risk of heart attacks, industry analysts said.    Both companies have developed drugs that slow the body'sproduction of cholesterol although Merck is about 18 monthsahead of Squibb with a drug expected to be approved this year.    "Certainly this study will create greater acceptance ofanti-cholesterol drugs," said Robert Uhl, a drug analyst at F.Eberstadt Fleming.    Although neither company's drug was used in the study,which was conducted by a team of scientists at the Universityof Southern California School of Medicine, both are leaders ina new class of drugs that fight cholesterol.    The study, reported in the Journal of the American MedicalAssociation, showed lower levels of cholesterol, achievedthrough a combination of drugs and special diet, slowed and insome cases reversed the build up of fatty deposits in theheart's arteries.    Such build up leads to heart attacks, the leading cause ofdeath in the U.S.    Health officials have said lower levels of cholesterolcould immediately benefit six mln Americans who suffer symptomsof coronary artery disease. The study advocated reduction ofcholesterol in some 40 mln Americans.    As the anti-cholesterol crusade gains momentum, industryanalysts and executives believe a healthier diet and drugtherapy will gain wider acceptance.    In this context, pharmaceutical analyst David Crossen ofSanford C. Bernstein said "the culture can shift in terms ofdrug treatment because some people arn't going to fundamentallyalter their diets".    The worldwide anti-cholesterol drug market is valued at 600mln dlrs a year. But as the new drugs reach the market,analysts estimate revenues will swell to 1.5 billion dlrsannually in about next five years.    The drugs used in the study, in combination with the lowcholesterol diet, were niacin, a common compound, andcolestipol, a drug Upjohn Co &lt;UPJ> has sold since 1977.    But these two drugs have some drawbacks that analysts saythe new drugs from Merck and Squibb avoid. "Niacin leads totremendous amounts of flushing, constipation, or stomachupset," Crossen said.    Colestipol, a sand-like powder, comes in a dosage of 15 to30 grams and must be mixed with a glass of water. "It isn't funto take," Crossen said. Drug analyst Uhl said the drawbacksrestricted Upjohn's sales for the drug, which he said is under10 mln dlrs a year.    In contrast, the new drugs from Merck and Squibb havelittle side effects because they target a key factor in thebody's production of cholesterol -- an enzyme found in theliver.       "Past methods of getting down cholesterol have been rathervariable," said Dr. Charles Sanders, an executive vicepresident at Squibb. The new drugs, in contrast, interupt aclear step in cholesterol production, Sanders said.    Also, the new drugs are easier to take since they come in atablet form swallowed once or twice a day.    Merck's drug, Mevacor, received a recommendation from anadvisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration earlier thisyear and is expected to receive full approval for sale in latesummer or fall.    Squibb's drug, eptastatin, is expected to be submitted forregulatory approval in the first or second quarter 1988,Sanders said.    Warner Lambert Co &lt;WLA> and Bristol Meyers Co &lt;BMY> alsohave cholesterol fighting compounds similar to the Upjohn drug,but only Merck and Upjohn are ahead in the new class ofcholesterol inhibitors.

Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was releasedin London today.    Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest furtherincrease in investment buying and may well be cautious.    He said South Africa was the most likely source ofadditional supplies and will need to increase output by about500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.    The capital investment required to produce the additionaloutput would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the politicalclimate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.    The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,Clark said.    "The very probability of a growth in demand set against themassive investment required for expansion - and that expansiononly being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me toconclude that the price of platinum will be substantiallyunderpinned in the medium to long-term," Clark said.

reut2-019.sgm, EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA, European coffee roasters and tradershave agreed to propose a new formula for calculatingInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch CoffeeTrade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.    Van Horick, who is a council member of the European CoffeeFederation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.    The new formula is based on six-year moving averages andwould give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, anunchanged quota for the remaining two years of the currentcoffee agreement, van Horick said.    If accepted by the consumer and producer members of theICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a newagreement, van Horick said.    Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year whenprices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster inBrazil.    Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers andproducers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.    "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in theformula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposalleaves it very little to object to," van Horick said.    "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does notreflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formulabuilds flexibility into the system and will benefit almosteveryone."    Although full implications of the new formula have still tobe worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such asColombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightlyhigher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, ElSalvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.    Because the proposal provides that future quotadistribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, itshould also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doingso would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.    "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at leasta fair chance of being accepted by the producers at theSeptember meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of anew quota formula, " van Horick said.    At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.    "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. Ifthere is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next twomonths and most other producers favour our proposal, we mightjust get an agreement," van Horick added. Reuter&#3;

Edward Sondey, vice president of supply, said that under agrandfather clause Brooklyn Union could request Transco totransmit 165 mln cubic feet (mcf) a day of spot natural gasafter purchasing 250 mcf of contract gas from Transco.    Brooklyn Union has been taking only 30 pct, or 75 mcf, ofthe contract gas from Transco, and acquiring about 120 mcf onthe spot, or non-contract, market, he said.    Lacking access to spot gas through Transco would not costBrooklyn Union more than 50 cts per mln btu for now,Sondey said, as Transco contract gas costs 2.55 dlrs per mlncompared to about two dlrs for spot gas.    "The rate increase will not be serious," Sondey said.    The contract price at 2.55 dlrs per mln BTU has beeneffective since May 1 after Transco lowered its commodity rateto reflect seasonal weakness, making it the lowest in the 12months ended May 31, according to report submitted by BrooklynUnion to New York Public Utility Commission.

Industry analysts expected little adverse effect frominterrupted spot supplies on Brooklyn Union's earnings for itscurrent fiscal year ending September 30.

reut2-019.sgm, LLOYDS BANK BOND MARKET WITHDRAWAL CALLED PRUDENT, Lloyds Bank Plc's &lt;LLOY.L> decision towithdraw from making markets in Eurobonds and U.K. Governmentbonds (gilts) sent shivers down the spines of other marketparticipants but was viewed as prudent by banking analysts.    "It (the move) really isn't a surprise. They lost a lot ofmoney in the early stages of the gilt market and now they wantto cut their losses while they can," said Keith Brown, bankinganalyst at Greenwell Montagu.    "The question now is how many other gilt market makers willface a similar fate," one senior gilt market maker said.    Eurobond market participants were equally stunned. "They arethe first firm of that size I can remember to have pulled outof eurobond market making altogether," said a member of theAssociation of International Bond Dealers London staff.    Other Eurobond market participants said that while Lloydshad frequently changed the staff of some of its eurobondoperations, it was hard to believe they were in trouble.    With this action Lloyds, the third largest U.K. clearingbank, becomes the first U.K. clearing bank to withdraw from thegilt market following the Big Bang deregulation of the LondonStock Exchange in October.    Earlier this year Midland Bank Plc &lt;MDBL.L>, the fourthlargest clearing bank, opted out of making markets in equitieson the grounds that the return did not justify the expense. Itcontinues as a market maker in gilts, however. In a preparedstatement, Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman said thebank had a "relatively small position in these two overcrowdedmarkets and we have decided to reallocate the resources toopportunities which promise a better return on our shareholdersinvestment."    Lloyds said it would maintain its presence in short-termsecurities trading, swaps and other treasury products.    Alan Moore, Lloyds Treasurer, told Reuters that thedecision was forward looking and followed a "strategic review" ofthe prospects for Lloyds in these markets. "We decided thereturn just was not attractive," he said.    Although the decision was made at a meeting of Lloyds boardthis morning, Moore said that it had been under considerationfor some time.    He denied that the move was a "reaction to events in thetrading room" although he acknowledged that the bank's giltoperations were not profitable in the early stages of the newmarket.    Greenwell's Brown noted that for all of 1986, LloydsMerchant Bank sustained a loss of 28 mln stg, most of which hesaid were accounted for by the Eurobond and gilt operations.For all of 1986, Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of 700 mlnstg. "Lloyds is so big, it can easily absorb these losses," Brownsaid, noting that they are minuscule when compared with thebank's exposure to Latin America.    U.K. Clearing banks have come under pressure to increasetheir provisions against bad loans to third world countriessince Citibank announced plans to add three billion dlrs to itsprovisions in mid-May.    National Westminster Bank Plc &lt;NWBL.L>, the largest of theclearers, became the first of the U.K. Clearers to followCiticorp's &lt;CCI> move earlier this week when it said it wasadding some 466 mln stg to its sovereign debt provisions.    Lloyds has the second largest exposure to Latin Americaafter Midland Bank, the smallest of the four clearers.    Lloyds has said it is reviewing the situation and Mooredenied that today's action had any connection. "It is totallyunrelated," he said.    Trading in Eurobonds and gilts had ended by the time theannouncement was made. But market participants weredumbfounded.    "We only heard the news about 20 minutes before theannouncement. I had no idea it was coming. I don't know if Istill have job," said one trader at Lloyds who declined to beidentified. Lloyds' Moore said that the bank would do all itcould to redeploy the staff affected by the decision in otherparts of the bank. But even though Lloyds' share of thesemarkets was relatively small, other market participants,particularly in gilts, were unnerved.    One senior gilt market maker noted that the news comesduring a period when both gilt and Eurosterling markets havebeen battered by the lack of investor participation, followingthe June 11 U.K. general election.    Most firms had held long positions on expectations that areturn of the ruling Conservative party would prompt heavydemand. These expectations have failed to be met and bothmarkets have sustained sizeable losses since the election.    Lloyds has long been the subject of rumors that it wasexperiencing problems with its gilt operations and officialshave never denied that the early stages were unprofitable.    Gilt market sources suggested that one of the problemsfacing Lloyds on the gilt side was its decision to build up itsown team. It was the only clearer which did not purchase abroker or a jobber (middle man) in the run-up to Big Bang.    Under the old system, these functions have been conductedseparately but now market makers perform both tasks.    But even long before Big Bang, market makers had expresseddoubts that the gilt market would be large enough to sustain 27market makers, even if turnover increased substantially.    And with Lloyds withdrawal, many market makers believe thatsome of the remaining 26 may opt to bow out gracefully. Reuter&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, SEC SUPPORTS INSIDER TRADING DEFINITION, The Securities and ExchangeCommission said it supported legislation to define insidertrading and would recommend language for such a definitionwithin six weeks.    Acting SEC chairman Charles Cox told the Senate BankingCommittee a bill proposed this week to define insider tradingas the wrongful use of material nonpublic information was goodbut contained some ambiguous provisions which might reduce theCommission's flexibility in prosecuting cases.    "The Commission believes a definition of insider trading isdesirable," Cox said.       He promised to provide the SEC's recommended definition tothe committee by August 3.    The bill proposed by Sens. Donald Riegle, a MichiganDemocrat, and Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican, wouldmake it illegal for anyone to receive or pass on insideinformation even if the person providing the information didnot use it to make a securities transaction.    Federal law enforcement officials have said a definition ofinsider trading would be useful because it is a difficult crimeto prove.       Cox said the SEC was having success in its insider tradingcases despite the lack of a clear definition.    He became acting chairman of the agency when chairman JohnShad left to become U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.    President Reagan nominated Northwestern University lawprofessor David Ruder as SEC chairman on Wednesday, but he maynot be confirmed by the Senate for several weeks.       Riegle, the chairman of the Senate securities subcommittee,said he wanted to act on the legislation this year, but ThomasMoore, a member of the President's Council of EconomicAdvisors, said action should be delayed until the Supreme Courtruled on the appearl of an insider trading conviction by formerWall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans.    Winans was convicted for telling a friend in advance whatstocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocksusually went up or down in price depending on Winans'recommendation.       "We believe it would be better to wait until the SupremeCourt has reviewed the Winans case before any leigilation isconsidered. After the court decides this case we can betterconsider how the law might be changed. Until that time,legislation is premature," Moore said in his testimony. Reuter&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, MALAYSIA TO RESEARCH TIN, WARY ON VEG OILS TAX, Malaysia is to urge fellow tinproducing countries to contribute more money towards researchinto new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industriesminister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview.    Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said hehad instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executivecommittee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC,to draw up a paper on the matter.    Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner FransAndriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.    He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposalsfor a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would bedefeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.    Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax wasadopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,they would be compensated through access to the EC foralternative exports.    "Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannotsee how this would work out in our case," Lim said.    Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250mln dlrs a year.    The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPCmeeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.    "Not enough research and development effort has been put inby tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutessuch as aluminium, paper and plastics," Lim said.    He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as anexciting possible new application.    Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra moneywhich needed to be spent on research into new uses before thenew paper was produced.    He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamentalbarriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new InternationalRubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accordinto some EC languages are still being awaited.    Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia'sbehalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said itwas important there should not be a long "interregnum" betweenthe old agreement lapsing in October and the new one cominginto force.    He described the present accord as a model for commodityagreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing andconsuming countries and by virtue of its review systems andcontrol over buffer stock management.

reut2-019.sgm, LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS, A group of Latin American andCaribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending inCongress, saying it would curb their exports, slow developmentand hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.    Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization ofAmerican States special committee on trade, said he was awareof the large U.S. trade deficit, but added "the region shouldnot be the one affected by the trade bills."    He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollarand the budget deficit, and "it is regrettable to solve it by atrade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."    Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after twodays of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now inCongress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.    Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly atJapan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,annual trade surpluses with the United States.    Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nationswith large trade surpluses last year with the United States,but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.    The European Community has also opposed the bills.    Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed theReagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections inthe legislation, including those to curb imports and to requireretaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.    He told reporters the committee would likely mount acampaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debateon the Senate floor, expected next week.    Rodriguez said "the region needs trade to continuedevelopment.  We hope this need will not be affected negativelyby trade legislation."    Rodriguez said: "we need to keep the market opens -especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreignexchange not only to service the debt but also to continuenational development progress."    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation hetermed "protectionist," and his aides now are mounting a effortto water down some of the objectionable provisions in thelegislation.    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguezsaid as yet "the administration is not in a veto frame of mind." reuter&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, COLOMBIA HELPFUL BUT COFFEE QUOTAS UNCERTAIN--U.S., A U.S. government trade officialresponsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord oncoffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombianefforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.    Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative justback from trade talks in Colombia, said most producingcountries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must beagreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.    "There is one country which evidently still does not,"Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which hasbeen negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.    Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlookfor an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the SeptemberInternational Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.    He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technicaldiscussions with Colombian officials.    While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of theColombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,Cardenas left a "positive letter," Rosenbaum said.    The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last monthwhich praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formulafor the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concernswith the technical details of the Colombian plan.    Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for commenton a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to byEuropean coffee roasters and traders.    Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horicksaid in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year movingaverages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota forthe remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.    The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotasunless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in thecoffee market are used to set export limits. Reuter&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, BRAZIL'S MOTOR INDUSTRY SUFFERS MAJOR SLOWDOWN, Brazil's crisis-ridden motor industry-- which is dominated by the subsidiaries of Volkswagen AG&lt;VOWG.F>, Fiat Spa &lt;FIAT.MI>, General Motor Corp &lt;GM> and FordCo &lt;F> -- has not made a single domestic sale for the last fourdays, and several assembly lines will stop shortly, industryspokesmen said.    The motor manufacturers have been feeling the pinch formonths, with demand slumping as the country heads intorecession.    But the industry hit a fresh problem when dealers decidedon Tuesday to stop buying any cars or trucks to protest highgovernment taxes on vehicles. The dealers' decision was sparkedby a 33 pct increase in car prices authorized last week by thegovernment to cover industry's rising costs.    Spokesman Marcio Stefani of the Brazilian Association ofAutmotive Vehicle Distributors said dealers felt theirlivelihood was at stake -- cars aren't selling because theycost too much.    "It is a question of our survival. The price of cars inBrazil has reached an insupportable level," he said. A GM OpalaDiplomata, he said, costs 30,000 dlrs in Brazil, while anequivalent car in the United States would cost about 10,000dlrs.    The National Association of Automotive VehicleManufacturers said that if the trade's boycott continues foranother week, consequences will be serious.    Association spokesman Fred Carvalho told Reuters, "Theconsequences will first of all be collective holidays thenlay-offs and a more and more catastrophic situation."    A spokesman for Ford Brasil said it would tell about halfof its 21,000 workforce to take holidays June 29-July 13.    Fiat announced yesterday that it would give 2,000 workers amonth's holiday, from July 6, halting production for thedomestic market.    Carvalho said the industry was working at 3,500 vehicles aday, below its 1986 average of 4,700 and capacity of 5,100.    During last year's Cruzado Plan price freeze, feverishdemand far outstripped supply. The industry says it could havesold many more cars than it produced, but was constrained by alack of parts.    Today the picture is completely different after months ofraging inflation and demand has all but disappeared.    Carvalho said the government taxes on cars added 138 pct tothe cost of the vehicle. He described the taxes as "the highestin the universe and the galaxy."    Domestic car sales during the first five months of thisyear slipped to their lowest level for a decade, 241,632 unitscompared with 382,182 units during the same period last year.    On the bright side, exports are booming -- sales abroad inMay totalled 242 mln dlrs, a record figure.    The motor industry is critical of the government ofPresident Jose Sarney, which has gained a reputation as anindifferent manager of the economy.    Last month Volkswagen said it was postponing indefinitelyinvestments of 150 mln dlrs planned for this year.    Wolfgang Sauer, president of Volkswagen do Brasil, said thegovernment had created a crisis of confidence.    Brazil's motor industry employs more than 150,000 people. Reuter&#3;
reut2-019.sgm, U.S. BROADENS NATIONAL BANK CAPITAL FORBEARANCE, U.S. Comptroller of the CurrencyRobert Clarke said his office is expanding a plan givingtemporarily ailing but well managed national banks extra timeto come into compliance with its minimum capital requirements.    The policy, which originally was intended to give well runbanks in economically depressed areas more time to rebuilddepleted capital levels, will be broadened to apply to allnational banks, Clarke said in a speech to a financial seminar.A text of his remarks was made public today.    The comptroller's office will extend the applicationdeadline for the plan to Dec. 31, 1989 from Dec. 31, 1987.    It will extend to 1995 from 1993 the deadline for banks toboost their capital levels to the required minimum level.    Finally, it will eliminate a current requirement that abank have capital of at least four pct to participate in thecapital forbearance plan.    "In theory, a bank could be allowed to continue to operatewith nearly zero capital if we approve its plan to rebuild itscapital base," Clarke said, though he added that a bank in thatsituation would have a have "a virtually ironclad plan for aprompt restoration of capital" to be accepted.    The critical linkage to forbearance is that thefundamentals must be in place to assure that the bank cansurvive: in short, capable management and financial prospects,"Clarke said.

State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made thedisclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the UnitedStates expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangementwith Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation inthe Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reaganadministration continued to come under fire in Congress for itsplans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.    The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranianattacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategicwaterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will drawthe United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.    "The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of charteringU.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration," Oakleysaid. She emphasized, however, that "if some charter arrangementcould be worked out, it would not supplant the reflaggingarrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis."

reut2-019.sgm, CHRYSLER &lt;C> MOVE CONTINUES TREND, Chrysler Corp is taking a small stepaway from automobiles and towards military contracting with thepurchase of Electrospace Systems Inc &lt;ELE>, analysts said.    "A chief goal of Chrysler is to gain military business fortheir Gulfstream planes and this should help that causedramatically," said analyst Gary Glaser at First Boston Corp.    Chrysler, which bought Gulfstream Aerospace Corp in 1985,earlier said Electrospace agreed to be acquired in a friendlymerger for about 367 mln dlrs.    Analysts said the merger continues a trend in theautomobile industry of diversification away from carmaking.    General Motors Corp &lt;GM> paid about five billion dlrs forHughes Aircraft, an aerospace company, in 1985. A year earlierit bought Electronic Data Systems, a data processing firm, forabout 2.5 billion dlrs.    Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> has added First NationwideSavings as part of a move into financial services.    Ford, which has a huge stockpile of cash, has indicated itsinterest in aerospace with Lockheed Corp &lt;LK> once rumored as apossible target.    Both Ford and Lockheed have denied the rumors, according toanalysts. Ford has about 9.5 billion dlrs of cash andsecurities on hand, one analyst said.    "The overall strategic thrust (within the car industry)is to become somewhat less sensitive to the vagaries of theautomobile sales cycle," said analyst Jack Kirnan at KidderPeabody and Co. "One way companies feel they can do it,particularly GM and Chrysler, is by diversifying intoaerospace," Kirnan said. Ford has been "a little bit of alaggard" in that area, he said, which has been a concern tosome investors.    Chrysler's first big move away from autos came in 1985,when it purchased Gulfstream for 637 mln dlrs.    Defense analysts said Chrysler was paying a high price forElectrospace but auto analysts regarded it as a modest outlayfor the company. Electrospace earned 10 mln dlrs on sales of191 mln dlrs in fiscal 1987 ended April 3.    Kirnan said Chrysler may have some trouble digesting theRichardson, Texas, electronics firm because it is also buyingAmerican Motors Corp &lt;AMC> for about two billion dlrs in a dealset to close later this year.    "Chrysler will have their hands full absorbing AMC for ayear or more and will absorb a lot of debt," Kirnan said,making them the most heavily leveraged auto company.    But other analysts said the relative small size ofElectrospace will make it easy for Chrysler to absorb.    Analysts also noted that Hughes has contributedsignificantly to GM and that Gulfstream provided about 57 mlndlrs in pretax earnings to Chrysler last year.    In a statement, Chrysler said 92 pct of Electrospace'ssales were to the military.    In addition to helping Gulfstream gain government business,Chrysler said it believes electronics technology will help theautomobile business.    Robert Miller Jr, Chrysler Corp vice chairman, said thatGulfstream's business, for example, involves electronics,composites and aerodynamic design. "Those will all be importanttechnologies for winning in the automobile business in the1990s," Miller told Reuters. Electrospace should addsignificantly to the electronics area, he said.    Miller said Electrospace earnings last year were hurt byone-time items and but should recover this year.    Miller said cash on hand will be used to pay forElectrospace.    "They have a substantial presence in Washington with 150 ormore professional people. They also have accounting systems inTexas to manage their business with the Defense Department," hesaid.    Both should be important in moving Gulfstream into themilitary market. "Gulfstream traditionally has been aimed moreat the commercial market, which is a different kettle of fish,"Miller said.

"There may be even more beyond that. I don't know yet," Bryensaid.    Toshiba is known to be seeking a U.S. Air Force contractfor 90,000 lap-top computers worth some 100 mln dlrs. The AirForce has called for new bids on that contract, partly becauseof the Toshiba investigation, Pentagon officials said.    The officials, who asked not to be identified, said thecomputer contract is also being re-advertised for biddingbecause of changes in the dlr-yen ratio and questions raised byU.S. import restrictions on some Japanese micro-electronics.    Two days ago, three U.S. senators said they wanted atemporary ban on all U.S. imports of Toshiba Corp products,including television sets and videotape recorders.    Senators Jake Garn of Utah, Richard Shelby of Alabama andJohn Heinz of Pennslvania said they might seek an amendment toa major trade bill being considered by the Senate this summer.    The Navy is reported to be furious over the technologytransfer, and Pentagon officials have told Reuters that some ofthe state-of-the-art propellers have already been mounted onSoviet attack submarines.    The Japanese government has already prohibited ToshibaMachine Co from doing any business with the Soviet Bloc for oneyear.    The Norweigan state-own firm Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk wasinvolved in the original technology transfer, providing vitalcomputer software to be used with the Japanese millingequipment.    But the Norweigan firm is now being reorganized and Bryensaid that it apparently was not involved in the alleged morerecent transfer of Toshiba Machine equipment. Reuter&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA, President Reagan's nominee as toppoliceman for the nation's securities markets will inherit anagency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stockprice gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from theglobalization of financial markets.    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor atNorthwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursdayto be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities andExchange Commission.    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeedJohn Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a recordsix years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as itsinvestigators have probed into the most colossal insidertrading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed inrecent months as a growing number of well known traders andprominent investment banking firms have been charged withwrongdoing.    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November afterIvan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stockspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigatorsand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegalprofits after being charged with insider trading.    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing newphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred bycomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations havecombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedentedvolatility to some U.S. securities markets.    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by somelawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporatetakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeoverssteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreignexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundworkfor an international securities marketplace in which tradingoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investmentopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforceU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financialdisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted tospur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency'sreview of hostile corporate takeovers.    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Huttoninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective tothe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.    In line with the views of other top administrationofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeoverbattles over new federal regulations.    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insidertrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases thattopped the agency's enforcement agenda during theadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted withRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely tosignificantly alter the commission's current priorities.    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of themlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though thatfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as theagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.    The agency is one of the few in the government thatactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the pastfew years because of fees it charges public companies,investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by thepresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firingfor policy differences alone.    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the samepolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget requesteach year instead of leaving this to the White House.    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its originsto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributedin large part to widespread trading on credit and attemptedmarket manipulations by large investment firms.    The agency requires public companies and investmentvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports ontheir financial condition and to disclose changes in theircondition any time they issue new securities.    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks toregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, andit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrialmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later tobecome the nation's 35th president.    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who servedfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon'sfirst term and was Reagan's director of the CentralIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

reut2-019.sgm, U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES, The Administration asked Congress toreplace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring itinto line with international tariff categories, U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter said.    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and moreaccurately define new composites, items not widely traded whenthe current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule iscalled, will change tariff categories and definitions to meetthe present-day needs of exporters and importers, but theyshould pay about the same rates of duties.    Yeutter said, "American exporters will find it far easier todeal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety ofdiffering systems which they now face."    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinationalnegotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.    Yeutter said government and business moves are based ondata from tariff schedules and the new system will improveknowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards underthe new system, with about half expected to join the system byJanuary 1988. reuter&#3;

Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month'soverall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decreeabolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreignsecurities purchases.   "The deficit can be better attributed to premature anddelayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment," Sarcinellisaid in a statement.    Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks bythe Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and saidit had been partly caused by "non-banking capital outflows."    "In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flowof capital to foreign securities or investments outside ourborders," said the newspaper.

In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transportcompany, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines alsotransport its own gas to customers.    Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERCguidelines, saying it would not offer open access until theregulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces forgas it has bought but could not sell.    The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or paycontracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-termcontracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe ascustomers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.    Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week thatTenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines toopen-access because of the take-or-pay issue.    But Tenneco today said open access "is one of the stepsFERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERCis moving the industry through this restructuring now, evenbefore all transitional problems are solved."    A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposureunder the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figurefor Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines fromLouisiana and Texas up to New England.    "We remain convinced that the most critical transitionalissue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved byFERC in the near future.    "A failure to do so could have grave consequences for theindustry's continued ability to provide its customers withreliable natural gas," said Tennessee Gas Transmission Copresident R.C. Thomas.

reut2-019.sgm, U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS, The economy faces lackluster growthand the risk of recession this year if the recent improvementin U.S. exports should falter, economists say.    Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weaknessin the key housing and auto sectors and could be furtherhampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.    "These factors raise the question: Is there enough strengthto keep the economy from tipping into a recession?" said LyleGramley, chief economist of the Mortgage BankersAssociation and a former Federal Reserve Board official.    The Commerce Department said this week that the economygrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, buta U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.    Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spendingrose a weak 0.1 per cent.    "Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, "Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,told Reuters.    Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slowbecause inflation is rising faster than real wages.    To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boostpersonal income and consumption, he says.    "I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports tokeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,"Gramley said.    Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reportersthat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was theresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not lastand said the recovery was showing anemia.    Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, "The paceof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored intomonetary policy" - possibly a signal that the Fed will beaccommodative.    Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pctforecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that ifthe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and addto the risk of a recession.    Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in Maycame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where aninventory overhang still exists.    He says the boost in production came from smallerindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which haveimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.    "They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge ineconomic activity, but I think they will keep us out of arecession," Mauro said.    In a speech to financial planners this week, BerylSprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted thetrade deficit will continue to improve.    "Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 andinto 1988 are still quite favorable," he said.    But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence ininflation.    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman BrothersInc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 aftera 1.1 pct increase in 1986.    The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oiland energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.    "The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie getsout of the bottle, it continues to persist," he said, adding hewould like the Fed to tighten credit.    A major factor affecting inflation is the value of thedollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, saysa prominent international banker.    Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the NationalPress Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen andthe mark will continue for years because the United States isthe world's largest debtor nation.    The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to afurther slackening of activity and called naive the belief thatthe five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever."It is very difficult to be optimistic," Gut said.

The FDA said industry standards require that roughly nomore than four out of 1,000 condoms leak. Condoms are tested bypouring 10 ounces of water in each and looking for leakage.    The FDA said Schmid Laboratories of Little Falls, N.J., hasvoluntarily recalled one lot of Sheik Fetherlite condoms, whichwas distributed to 22 accounts through the United States.       The agency said Schmid reported that almost all of thecondoms were still in transit or at wholesalers at the time ofthe recall and are being recovered.    National Sanitary Labs of Lincolnwood, Ill, voluntarilyrecalled a lot of Protex Contracept Plus brand latex condomswhich were distributed to a wholesaler in California and tworetailers in Indiana and Michigan, the FDA said.    The FDA said National estimates that none of the suspectlot remains on the market. The FDA also said National recalledtwo more lots of condoms following additional FDA tests.    The FDA also said Circle Rubber Corp of Newark, N.J., isvoluntarily recalling Saxon and L'appel condoms after beinginformed of FDA test results. The FDA said the condoms weredistributed in North Carolina and Illinois.

reut2-019.sgm, UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES, The six basis point rise of the pastmonth in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by aseries of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as thedollar holds firm.    "Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basispoints over the last month, largely over indications thatinflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowingU.S. trade balance, in nominal terms," Samuel Kahan, chieffinancial economist with Kleinwort Benson GovernmentSecurities, said.    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength inthe economy during the first quarter, but his concern iswhether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in thelonger term.    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which hasbecome more important to the direction of debt futures than thebeneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. ConsumerPrice Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down1.5 pct, respectively.    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 moneysupply announced this week was "surprising, much larger thanexpected," according to Kahan. "Unless quickly reversed," sucha trend "will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,"Kahan said.    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates whichKahan said have "slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Boardannual targets," the consequences could be a hint of economicweakness down the road, he said.    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised forfurther gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,analysts said.    September T-bonds "are up almost six points since about May18," Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. Septemberbond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93in mid-June, Duggan said.    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide throughchart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwartedabove the 93 level.    "The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be takenout before this activity is anything other than a trading rangemarket," Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analystBrian Singer said.    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.    "The critical variable remaining in the market is the valueof the dollar," Kahan said.    Additional influences next week will be possibledevelopments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impactand size of the U.S. budget deficit, "although these will notbe in the forefront of the market early next week," Kahan said.    In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refundingauctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday andThursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the resultswith little excitement. However, a successful auction couldprove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing marketpsychology. Reuter&#3;
reut2-019.sgm, CANADA POST SEEKS MEDIATOR, VIOLENCE ON PICKET, Canada Post asked the federal governmentto appoint a mediator to help end an increasingly violentseries of strikes by the country's letter carriers.    The government is expected to respond quickly to therequest that was made after the union formally rejected thecorporation's latest offer to settle the four-day-old dispute.    The state-run postal service also said it would halt theuse of replacement workers that the union has blamed for thetrouble on the picket line.    "We have become increasingly concerned that the safety ofour employees, both striking employees and replacement workers,is at risk," Canada Post negotiator Harold Dunstan toldreporters at a downtown Ottawa hotel.    Robert McGarry, president of the 20,000 member LetterCarriers Union, told reporters he and other union leaders wouldconsider suspending the walkouts for a week while the mediatoris involved.    In a bid to step up pressure on management, letter carrierswalked out in Toronto today where some 50 pct of the country'smail is sorted.    Workers also set up picket lines in other populous citiesin southern Ontario, but went back to work in most othercenters across Canada.    There have been several arrests, property damage, andsometimes violent clashes between strikers and replacementworkers whom the corporation hired to try and keep the mailmoving.

reut2-019.sgm, JUDGE HEARS APPEALS AGAINST MANVILLE &lt;QMAN> PLAN, A federal judge heard arguments thatManville Corp's chapter 11 reorganization plan, which wasconfirmed in December, should be thrown out.    During a four-and-a-half hour hearing, U.S. District JudgeWhitman Knapp heard arguments in five different appeals.Whitman took the issues under advisement and will rule at alater date.    Key challenges were made by a group of Manvilleshareholders, who claim they were not adequately representedduring the bankruptcy proceedings and that a 2.5 billion dlrfund to pay victims of asbestos is overfunded.       Another challenge came from a group of asbestos victims whoclaimed the trust fund was underfunded.    Today, Manville lawyers said there have been about 54,000claims filed by those injured by asbestos.    The reorganization plan also sets up a trust fund, withinitial funding of 125 mln dlrs, to pay for property damageclaims. Additional funds will be available if needed. Manvillesaid there are currently 9,500 property damage claims filed.    Manville filed for bankruptcy in 1982 and itsreorganization plan was approved by all parties except thecommon stockholders.       The stockholders objected to the proposal because it wouldgreatly dilute the value of their holdings. The plan would havethe effect of converting every eight shares of common stockinto just one share.    Manville lawyers today criticized shareholder groups forfurther delaying the execution of the bankruptcy plan. HerbertEdelman, one of Manville's lawyers, pointed out that manythousands of victims and creditors were still awaiting paymentsand that many victims had already died.    He also pointed out that the bankruptcy court had foundManville to be insolvent.    "They (shareholders) want the plan put aside to get thatnebulous value that may be down the road," Edelman said.    Common shareholders claim they were not adequatelyrepresented because U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Liflandrefused requests to divide the equity holders committee intotwo separate groups, one repesenting common shareholders andthe other preferred stock shareholders.    During confirmation hearings of the plan, the equitycommittee's lawyer George Hahn walked out of the hearing,saying he could not represent both groups.    The equity holders committee was then abolished.       An unofficial committee representing 10 pct of thecompany's stock was present at the confirmation hearings.However, lawyers for that committee did not present evidence orcross examine witnesses.    During today's hearing Paul Gonson, a Washington lawyerrepresenting the Securities and Exchange Commission, told JudgeKnapp that the agency was also concerned that the shareholdersdid not have adequate representation.    Knapp said the unofficial committee was represented by theNew York law firm of Kronish, Lieb, Weiner and Hellman. "Theyhave one of the best law firms in town," Knapp said. Reuter&#3;

They said the market should extend the dull trend it hasbeen in since the 225-share index fell rapidly from the recordclose at 25,929.42 on June 17.    It ended at 24,902.72 on Saturday and fell further thismorning to close at 24,707.68 in an uncertain reaction to theweaker yen and the weekend OPEC accord.    Brokers said attention could focus more on the cheaper,less well-known stocks in the exchange's first and secondsections, which were generally showing more resilience. Thesecond section index, in contrast to the first, closed at arecord 2,404.64 on June 26, surpassing the peak set on June 17of 2,401.71.    "Probably shares of companies involved in the domesticeconomy are a good bet," said a broker at Daiwa Securities CoLtd. He said his observation was based on figures showing thatbusiness activity in Japan is booming.    The government said on Friday that department store andsupermarket sales rose 7.5 pct in May from a year earlier,while orders received by Japan's 50 major construction firms inthe same month were up 7.6 pct year on year. Brokers expectedmore such figures, but said many stocks linked to domesticdemand remain overpriced.    "They are hard to find, but companies with an attractiveniche in the domestic economy, unaffected by currencymovements, are the best bet," said a broker at a foreignsecurities house who declined to be identified.    But sharp rises in money supply and voracious domesticconsumption are stirring inflation fears. The consumer priceindex rose 0.2 pct in May from April, the third consecutivemonth on month increase.    Although investors are not unduly worried about inflation,which erodes the real value of stock holdings, they say risingprices arouse concern that interest rates may climb.    The recent market advances have been assuming a further cutin Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate. Such assumptions have nowdied, discouraging investors, brokers said.    If oil prices rise, the stock market in Japan could suffera downturn as higher production costs stir inflation.    But share prices of Japan's oil importing companies mayalso firm, brokers said. "I have never been able to justify thisbecause it should mean that the cost of importing rises," said abroker at Yamaichi Securities Co. "It just always happens."    Export-oriented companies may continue their recent rallyif the dollar climbs against the yen. But prices of many bluechip exporters have risen fast over the last two weeks, makingthem look less attractive, brokers said.    However, if the dollar falls to about 140 or 138 yen, themarket index may rally, brokers said. A lower dollar could dampdown rising capital outflows into dollar investments fromJapan's stock and bond markets, brokers said.    And as the yen/dollar rate is supposed to reflect thebalance of trade between the United States and Japan, a lowerdollar would bring more pressure on Japan to expand its demandfor American imports by stimulating its local economy, brokerssaid.    "If the dollar falls, buy domestic, if it rises, maybe buy afew exporters," said one foreign broker. REUTER&#3;

But the balance sheet total at the end of May was four pcthigher than one year earlier as savings continued to flow intothe bank, he told the annual press conference.    BfG parent bank partial operating profits halved to 166 mlnmarks in 1986 from 311 mln in 1985, with the balance sheetfalling to 48.80 billion marks from 49.02 billion.    Wegscheider declined to give a forecast for the full year,and noted that the first four months of this year were notcomparable with the 1986 period as first quarter 1986 had beenextremely successful for the bank.    The general banking environment this year was not easy,with the interest margin under pressure, securities businesssuffering from markedly lower bourse turnover than last yearand sluggish credit demand, he said.    "As far as the specific BfG environment is concerned, wenote a clear atmospheric improvement, which however is beingreflected in the figures only slowly," he added.    Wegscheider said the bank was recovering from speculationabout its ownership, which had unnerved many customers lastyear, and from the financial crisis involving the Neue Heimathousing group linked to BfG's former trade union owners.    Insurer Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG &lt;AMVG.F>,AMB, acquired 50 pct plus one share of BfG late last year.    Wegscheider said that earnings from trading on the bank'sown account in 1986 had been a little higher than partialoperating profits, but had performed better in the first half.    Following the AMB acquisition, BfG sold its 25.01 pct stakein &lt;Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, its 74.9pct in &lt;BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> andfive pct of &lt;Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>.    These sales produced extraordinary earnings of 700 mlnmarks, with parent bank earnings from profit transferagreements rising to 494.18 mln marks in 1986 from 54.24 mln in1985, and other earnings including writing bank risk provisionsrising to 317.95 mln marks from 65.67 mln.    Wegscheider said most of the extraordinary earnings wentinto risk provisions.    Total risk provisions, undetailed, were more than twice ashigh as in 1985, Wegscheider said. Published group riskprovisions rose to 865.9 mln marks from 366.7 mln. But theshare of credits to problem countries covered by riskprovisions was still below 50 pct at BfG, he said.    The BSV Bank stake sale was one of the main factors behinda 3.8 billion mark drop in the group balance sheet in 1986.    Wegscheider said the re-organization of BfG, planned beforethe AMB acquisition and involving a decentralization, wouldoccupy much of BfG's energies this year.

"I have reached the conclusion that I cannot but choose thedirect presidential election system to overcome socialconfusion and achieve national compromise," Roh said.    There was no immediate indication of how soon Chun wouldreact to Roh's proposals or whether he was involved in theirformulation.    The president, who took office in 1980 following a militarycoup, is due to step down next February after elections whichhad tentatively been set for December.    Under Roh's package, Chun would remain president until hissuccessor was chosen by direct elections. At present, thepresident is chosen through an electoral college system whichthe opposition says is stacked in favour of the DJP.    Among other major changes, the package offers a release ofmost political prisoners, a guarantee of human rights and afree press.    Kim Young-sam, head of the opposition ReunificationDemocratic Party, said, "I wholeheartedly welcome Chairman Roh'sannouncement, though it was a belated measure."    A Western diplomat told Reuters "It's a very substantial,very courageous move."    The second surprise in Roh's proposals was an amnesty forleading dissident Kim Dae-jung, who has been banned frompolitics because of a suspended sentence for sedition charges.    The only opposition demand which is not met by Roh'spackage is the RDP's insistence that Chun should step downimmediately. REUTER&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD, OPEC has shown itself to be in controlof the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out apact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day(bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.    They said market respect for the cartel has increased sinceit announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter outputto 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.    "There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensuredthere will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is ineffect putting pressure on end-users," a European crude oiltrader said.    In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, "There's no reason to expecta weak market from now on."    A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, "Wethought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarterproduction so the market will react very bullishly."    Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only aslight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmarkcrude, they expect price increases over the next few days.    August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity ataround 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but stillbelow the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.    Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and AbuDhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weakpositions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traderssaid sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.    They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices tostabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.    They said the Japanese oil market would be most affectedand Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winterrequirements before October.    Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter onEuropean and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.    "There's no doubt consumption will be higher than productionby the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high," said aninternational trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was lessbullish, "For sure there will be some shortage but it depends onhow much they (OPEC members) cheat."    A Singapore trade source said, "There is enough cheating andleakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there isno need to worry about shortages."    Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearishfactor to be considered.    Traders also said end-users now would buy as much aspossible on term contracts and buy spot only when the marketcooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.    Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed inthin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillatesquiet on minimal buying interest.    Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand andtight prompt supplies, dealers said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY, OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boostspot prices and enable the group to raise its officialreference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.    "Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and theofficial price will be 20 dlrs in January," a Japanese refinersaid.    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPECmembers such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait andQatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading asthe market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrsfor Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs forU.K. Brent, traders said.    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked intothe U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.    "With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will importMideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen thosegrades further," said a Japanese oil trader.    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spotmarket has further upward potential in the short term, havingrisen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.    "You could certainly argue that if New York rose on thatbasis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today," saidone international oil trader in Tokyo.    "But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be boughtback up again pretty quickly," he added.    One oil industry analyst concurred, "There is no reason toexpect a weak market from now on." He said he expected OPEC toraise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge stronglyin the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members andthe likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer tomaintain steady prices.    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per daycompared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Itsexport capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipelinethrough Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting upto 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheatingon the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective pricediscounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. Butthey mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act asswing producer, cutting production to compensate for higheroutput by other members or boosting output if spot prices risetoo high too fast.    Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mlnbarrels. "Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so thestockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it risestoo much," an oil industry analyst said. REUTER&#3;

Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,left in a major oil industry shake up last December.    The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold thepost permanently.

OPPOSITION PARTY UNVEILS ECONOMIC POLICY, New Zealand's opposition NationalParty said it would cut personal and business taxes and wouldnot regulate or control interest rates if returned to power.    The economic strategy was unveiled by party leader JimBolger one day before prime minister David Lange announces thedate of general elections, widely expected to be August 15.    The National Party's tax policies included the abolition ofdeath and gift duties and the removal of indirect taxes onbasic food and doctors' fees.    The most recent opinion poll, taken on June 20, gave Laboura 26 point lead over National or eight points more than a monthearlier.    National said that under its administration the New Zealanddollar would find its level with "complementary fiscal andmonetary policies." The party did not elaborate.    Controversy over National's economic policy erupted inMarch when former prime minister Robert Muldoon said the partyhad adopted a policy of a managed exchange rate.    Bolger said then that the National Party would continue tofloat the dollar.    Since the dollar was floated by the Labour Party in March1985 it has risen about 34 pct, cutting the export incomes offarmers, who are traditional National Party supporters.    The party said tight monetary policies alone would lead tounrealistic exchange rates which would be out of line forexporters unless they were supported by a low governmentborrowing requirement, a shrinking government sector andpositive growth.    It aimed to keep aspects of deregulation which havebenefitted New Zealanders while cutting government spending,unemployment, interest rates, inflation and tax.

reut2-019.sgm, NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY, Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback inplanned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helletold Reuters.    "We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,"he said. "The accord reached there means stability in the oilmarket and we shall continue making our contribution."    The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, wouldprobably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Hellesaid. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies andwould now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 andretained the fixed prices that were set in its December accordbased on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, andit's December pact had provisionally set a third quarterceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourthquarter.    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshorefields, previously said it would continue its output curbs fromplanned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remainedwithin its December accord on output and prices.    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mlnbpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented sinceFebruary reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland fora meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statementon the latest oil production cutbacks.    Over the past year several other leading non-OPECproducers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysiaand Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keepprices stable.    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following anOPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total exportearnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil priceduring the first half of 1986.    But firmer oil prices since then have brought somestability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign tradedeficit.     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistentlyrefused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up tothe producing oil companies to set the levels of production. REUTER&#3;

A decline in BHP Steel's net profit to 200.02 mln dlrs inthe 1987 year ended May 31, 1987, from 253.87 mln the yearbefore, contributed to the drop in attributable group earningsto 820.27 mln dlrs from 988.20 mln.    "We look forward to a 1988 year of consolidation whilecontinuing our strong business development initiatives," BHPSteel chief executive officer David Rice told reporters.    Rice said BHP Steel's capital spending in 1987 totalled 701mln dlrs, and that total expenditure would be about 1.4 billiondlrs by the time the government's five-year Steel Industry Planexpires at the end of calendar 1988.    He said the investment program, aimed at making BHP Steelboth technically and commercially competitive on a world scale,was now over its peak and would begin to scale down.    Operational and commissioning problems flowing from theinvestment program, combined with the highest levels ofindustrial action since the steel plan started, had contributedto the decline in 1987 earnings, he said.    Rice said the industrial and production problems forced BHPSteel to import 280,000 tonnes of steel in its 1987 financialyear to keep faith with customers.    The new items of plant are now past their initial teethingproblems and talks have intensified with the unions on theindustrial troubles, he said.    Despite the profit drop in the 1987 year, BHP SteelInternational group was one of the most profitable steelproducers in the world on an after-tax basis, he said.    Its capacity utilisation was far higher, at 89 pct, thanthe current western world average of 69 pct, he added. REUTER&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, ZIMBABWE WAGE FREEZE SHOWS ECONOMIC MALAISE, Zimbabwe's temporary freeze on salaries,wages and prices will give the economy a breather, but radicaleconomic reforms are needed to resuscitate business and attractforeign investment, economists said.    They said the June 24 freeze on government, state companyand private sector wages until January 1988 has postponed,rather than provided, solutions to Zimbabwe's economicproblems.    They urged a review of the tax system, the introduction ofinvestment incentives, a review of foreign exchange and pricecontrols and a check on government expenditure.    These measures would aim to stimulate investment and createemployment for the 100,000 school leavers annually seekingjobs.    The freeze, which Finance Minister Bernard Chidzero saidwould check production costs and reduce the budget deficit, hasbeen partly welcomed by business but criticised by workerswhose real purchasing power has been severely eroded since1980.    The government announced the freeze amid a worseningeconomic crisis caused by serious drought, a budget deficit ofmore than one billion Zimbabwean dlrs and an acute balance ofpayments problem owing to debt service costs, now 357 mln U.S.Dlrs on an external debt of two billion U.S. Dlrs.    The crisis has forced the country to make companies halvedividend remittances to overseas shareholders.    The Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce supported thefreeze on wages and salaries but criticised the promisedstricter control of prices of goods and services.    "If those companies whose costs of production increase arenot allowed a price increase, profit margins will again beseverely squeezed, and this would negate current governmentefforts to revitalise the economy," the chamber said.    The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said the freeze wouldworsen the plight of the lowest paid workers.    The union body has been campaigning for a minimum monthlywage of 277 Zimbabwean dlrs (165 U.S. Dlrs). The lowest paidnow earn about 100 dollars (60 U.S. Dlrs).    "Inflation is hitting hardest those in the low incomebracket which demands that any economic recovery programmeshould be biased in their favour," the union body said.    It added that the promised price freeze was "bolting thestable door when in fact the horse is gone" because prices ofmost basic commodities had already risen phenomenally.    Both unions and business hope that the freeze heralds areturn to wage bargaining between workers and employers, ratherthan government-regulated pay awards.    Zimbabwe has, since 1980, set annual minimum wages fordifferent sectors of the economy and awarded wage and salaryincrements on a sliding scale which gave higher increases tothe lowest paid.

reut2-019.sgm, BANKS IN SINGAPORE SET TO INCREASE SECURITISATION, Banks in Singapore are planning tofurther expand their treasury, securities, equities and debtinstruments activities in line with global financial markets,bankers and economists told Reuters.    "Banks are moving towards treasury activities because theysee them as a vital link in global capital and foreign exchangemarkets," Clemente Escano, vice-president of Union Bank ofSwitzerland, said.    Central to that link is the Asian Dollar Market's pool offunds, with deposits estimated at 212 billion dlrs in March.    Banks are fond of booking and tapping offshore Asian DollarMarket funds here for a variety of reasons, including lowtaxes.    New impetus has come to this market with growth of 52billion dlrs in the year to March partly due to theliberalisation of financial markets in Japan leading to anincrease in interbank activity, bankers said.    Despite the slowdown in traditional loan syndications inthe region, the offshore market has continued to grow as banksrebundle and securitise their assets, creating new generationsof tradeable debt instruments, bankers said.    Singapore's daily turnover in foreign exchange dealing hasincreased to 30 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1987 against 21 billionlast year, according to Finance Minister Richard Hu.    Susumu Sakaguchi, manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said the22 Japanese banks in Singapore were expanding their foreignexchange departments, which accounted for at least 30 to 40 pctof total bank activities last year.    Sakaguchi said the liberalisation of the Toyko marketstimulated Asian Dollar deposits and foreign exchange turnoverand is leading to active Japanese futures trading on theSingapore International Monetary Exchange.    Robin Tomlin, managing director of Singapore InternationalMerchant Bankers Ltd, said international merchant banks clusterin Singapore because of the tax incentives, presence of majorplayers and shift in regional capital flows.    Tomlin pegged much of the future of the Singapore bankingindustry to securities and equities.    "In 1988 we should see an expansion of securities tradingfollowing the link-up" of the Stock Exchange of SingaporeDealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ) with the Londonexchange and the National Association of Securities DealersAutomated Quotation System (NASDAQ), he said.    Equity and equity-linked issues have dominated thefinancial markets here to date because of buoyant domestic andinternational stock markets. Tomlin said privatisationprogrammes, both in Singapore and abroad, would encourage hugeflows of capital through the banks.    Applications received for the 30 mln Singapore Airlineshares offered last week were worth 601.1 mln Singapore dlrs.The share offer by Sembawang Maritime Ltd raked in a record 6.8billion Singapore dlrs in May this year.    Bankers said Singapore's privatisations and links withexchanges abroad showed its determined international stance.    Singapore's four major local banks have been venturing intostockbroking, the new government securities market and SESDAQ,competing successfully for business with the merchant banks.    Tomlin said merchant banks will continue to play animportant role in the Singapore domestic capital markets butthe modest size of the total market would limit the potentialof new entrants.    Bankers said a total of 650 mln U.S. Dlrs was raised in theSingapore capital market last year and the volume of new issueswould to grow in 1987.    Total lending by banks in Singapore fell by 1.04 billiondlrs in March 1987 compared with last year following the trendtowards asset management services and other capital marketactivities.    Hans-Rudolf Schaub, the senior vice-president and managerof Swiss Bank Corp, said his bank has chosen Singapore as itsAsian treasury centre because of favourable tax rules foroffshore banks, political stability and economic growth.    He said the bank might set up a securities portfoliomanagement service here in addition to its existing links ininternational money market services with Zurich and New York. REUTER&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, BANK OF JAPAN WORRIES ABOUT MARKET COLLAPSE, The Bank of Japan has become increasinglyworried about a possible crash of high-flying financialmarkets, Bank of Japan sources said.    "We're afraid that someday the bubble will burst and thatthe deflationary impact on the economy will be very disastrous,"one source said.    They said the central bank has embarked on a delicatepolicy -- it wants to deflate the speculation that has pumpedup prices sharply in recent months without bursting the bubble.    Stock prices plunged 393.31 points today, extending thesharp declines of earlier this month, as the market speculatedthat interest rates would rise.    The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen in certificates ofdeposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements today to show itsdetermination to maintain an easy money policy, central bankofficials said.    Today's CD buying operation was designed to reassure themarket the Bank has not changed its policy, a senior centralBank official told Reuters.    "There is a possibility that a deflationary impact wouldpermeate the economy if the prices of existing assetscollapsed," the Bank of Japan said earlier this month in itsannual economic report.    Such a possibility has been heightened by what the Banksees as excessive speculation in stock, bond and land prices.    Over the last two years, the stock market average hasdoubled, driving price/earnings ratios to over 70, comparedwith about 15 on Wall Street. Bond yields have dropped sharply,while land prices in Tokyo have soared.    The excessive speculation means the markets areincreasingly out of touch with economic reality and thus morevulnerable, one central bank source said.    A collapse now could rob businessmen and consumers of whatlittle confidence they have in the economy after theyen-induced recession of the past year, private economistssaid.    Some hard-pressed exporters already make greater profitsthrough financial dealings than from their basic businesses,they said.    "There seems to be an accelerated demand for money tosupport transactions in shares, bonds, land and other existingassets which has little bearing on value added and therefore onGNP," the Bank of Japan said in its report.    The increased inclination of investors to seek capitalgains and the accompanying rise in prices of existing assetscould have dangerous implications for the economy, it added.    In the Bank's view, a major reason behind skyrocketingprices was its own easy monetary policy and the belief in themarket that interest rates were heading inexorably lower.    Mindful of the potential inflationary dangers posed byexcessive liquidity, the Central Bank's board recently decidedit had to spell out clearly to the markets that a furtherdiscount rate cut was not in the offing, one source said.    But the bank had to do that without tightening monetarypolicy and running the risk of a market collapse.    This was achieved partly by a rise in short-term interestrates, which Bank sources ascribed to seasonal pressures and toa change in market expectations.    While denying the bank was tightening monetary policy, asenior source welcomed the change in market expectations.    The source acknowledged the shift may have been causedpartly by the decision to press commercial banks to limitlending in the July/September period. Faster than expectedeconomic growth and a strong dollar also played a part.    In the longer run, the Central Bank is counting on agradual upturn in the economy to draw liquidity from thefinancial markets into productive areas like capital spending,one Bank of Japan economist said.    But while it waits for that to occur over the next sixmonths, it may have to avoid any overt tightening of monetarypolicy that could collapse the market and lead to recession. REUTER&#3;

Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changeswere aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boostforeign exchange earnings and imports of essential machineryand raw materials, to increase industrial production.    The government was easing procedures to enhance incentivesespecially for exporters of textiles and frozen food andimporters of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim toldreporters.    Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policycovered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billiondlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by thegovernment were not included in the policy, they added.    They said the country's total import bill (both commercialand other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs inthe new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.    The minister said ending restrictions on imports of carsand dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm theeconomy.

Nakasone has argued that the tax system must be reformed toprovide the revenue for more than 1,000 billion yen of tax cutspromised in the government's emergency economic package lastmonth. But his argument has been undercut by reports that the1986/87 tax take was as much as 2,500 billion yen more thanexpected.    That means the government should have more than enoughmoney in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for theplanned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular taxmeasures proposed by Nakasone, one official said.    The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and theabolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raisingrevenue to offset the tax cuts.    But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea ofan indirect tax, at least for the time being. He still hopes togain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks onsmall savings.    The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmedfrom increased receipts from land and securities taxes, asprices of both shares and land soared, one official said.    But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant thanexpected, perhaps indicating the recession of the last yearinduced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought, he said.    The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to bereleased by the Finance Ministry on July 1.    The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercutattempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduceinvestment spending by government departments in the 1988/89budget, several officials said.    A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted tostick with its so-called "minus-ceiling" policy, which calls forgovernment departments to reduce investment spending by fivepct a year.

An auditors' report on the affair, prepared in time forthis week's annual shareholders' meeting, largely cleared themanagement of Volkswagen of blame.    But "mud sticks," said Gavin Launder, an analyst withScrimgeour Vickers in London.    (See index on ECRA)    The financial daily, Boersenzeitung, wrote in a commentary:"More devastating than the losses linked to the currency scandalis the resulting loss of image for the company."    VW had to make provisions of 473 mln marks to cover lossesfrom unauthorised foreign exchange deals which the auditors,Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft, said highlighted major gaps inthe supervisory apparatus of the firm's financial department.    The auditors' report highlighted failings in VW'scontrolling system, especially in relation to a 385 mln markdeal with the Hungarian National Bank, but shed little light onwhy they were made.     It said the contracts did not benefit VW and were onlyadvantageous to its banks. It did not detail how the foreignexchange dealers may have profitted.    It concluded: "The nature, scope and technical constructionof the deals ... Suggest a targeted and professionally executedmanipulation to the detriment of VW."    The head of the finance department, Rolf Selowsky, resigneddays after the scandal broke in March. He is not accused of anywrongdoing, but auditors concluded he had "not applied thenecessary diligence in all instances."    Two former VW foreign exchange dealers have been arrested.    But even VW admits that the report, published last week,revealed important company failings.    Peter Frerk, who has temporarily taken over Selowsky'sreponsibilities, said the findings were "not a first classacquittal." The currency swindle was a "lamentable event for ourcompany," he told journalists.    The auditors said the remaining members of VW's managementboard and supervisory board had correctly fulfilled theirobligations, a verdict which almost certainly means that majorWest German banks, who vote on behalf of large numbers ofshareholders, will ratify both boards at the July 2 meeting.    Many market analysts, especially in London, do not believea sharp rise in VW's share price last week reflects a majorreassessment of the firm on the basis of the auditors' report.    The stock closed at 430 marks on Friday, up 11 pct from aweek earlier. Dealers referrred to short-term bargain-hunting,and one London broker said "I'm not sure it's much of a bargain."Most brokers said they would not recommend clients to buy atthese levels.    Analysts believe VW will do well to match its 1986 groupnet profit of 582 mln marks this year, and one broker in Londonsaid the company would be lucky to report profits only 15 pctdown.    VW is expected to fare very well both in its home marketand in Europe. But sales have fallen sharply in the U.S andBrazil, where the latest price freeze could exacerbate resultseven further.    The company hopes to benefit in the long term from itstakeover of the Spanish company SEAT, but this subsidiary isstill producing losses.    VW has also just announced a deal to build light pick-uptrucks with Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T> at an under-utilisedplant in Hanover, but analysts noted production here was onlyexpected to take off fully in 1990.

Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained itsceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quartersof 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarterlevel of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quartertarget.    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC thirdquarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd whilefourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd"    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these productionlevels would have on prices.    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused toadhere to it and has recently been producing around two mlnbarrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabiaand Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted whena 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in aboutSeptember.    Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf Warenemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369mln in the second half.    Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production fromthe Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which hasbeen supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. "We willnot discuss it. There will not be any change," he said.    Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and endedSaturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problemsto be adressed. "We are overdoing it in holding too short ameeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet," he said.    Ali said the problem of price differentials between theprices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properlyat the meeting.    Ali said "The problem of differentials is a real one. Iwould hate to be producing today a light crude and that problemhas not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpricedrelative to heavy crudes."    Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at thenext OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not dothe work of another minister."

reut2-019.sgm, INTERNATIONAL SPOT OIL PRICES FIRM ON OPEC ACCORD, OPEC's weekend decision to cut plannedoil output levels for second half 1987 has renewed marketconfidence in the oil price outlook for the rest of the yearand boosted international spot prices, oil traders said.    Spot crude prices are now standing 80-85 cents a barrelhigher than at the start of the OPEC meeting last Thursday andcould continue their rise in the next few weeks, they said.    The new optimism springs from the agreement reached by OPECministers in Vienna on Saturday to fix a July-December outputceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd).    At its previous meeting in December, OPEC set a provisional16.6 mln bpd output limit for the third quarter but proposed asharp rise to 18.3 mln in the fourth. The ceilings were to backup its newly restored fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.    When signs first emerged last Friday that OPEC wascontemplating cutting the planned fourth quarter ceiling, spotprices of the most widely traded crude oil, Britain's BrentBlend, surged 30-40 cents a barrel.    Traders said the trend continued in a cautious rally thismorning in London, taking quoted levels up to around 19.25/35dlrs, compared with 18.45/50 dlrs in the middle of last week.    Most traders on international oil markets reacted bullishlyto news of the final agreement. They forecast tight supplieslater in the year, when demand for oil increases with the onsetof the Northern Hemisphere winter, and further rises in spotprices.    "There will be a scramble for oil in the third and fourthquarters of this year" one trader said. "In the past three monthswe have already seen a rise in demand, particularly from theU.S., And I expect to see even higher prices" he added.    Mehdi Varzi, analyst with stockbroker Kleinwort Grievesonin London, agreed.    Varzi told Reuters that OPEC was if anything too cautiousin setting the new output ceilings. "There is now a great chancethat Brent crude oil will hit 20 dlrs a barrel in the nextmonth," he said.    Laurie Law, analyst at E.F. Hutton and Co Inc in New York,said over the weekend that she saw the spot price of West TexasIntermediate (WTI) rallying to around 22 dlrs by the end of theyear from just over 20 dlrs now.    WTI, the U.S. Benchmark crude, usually fetches a premium of80 cents to one dlr over Brent. So far this year, spot Brenthas held mostly between 18 and 19 dlrs a barrel.    But some traders, fearing continued over-production by someOPEC members, sounded a note of caution over the new accord.    Iraq has again refused to be a party to the agreementbecause other OPEC ministers turned down its repeated demandfor the same production quota as its Gulf War enemy Iraq.    In recent months Iraq has been producing 500,000 bpd aboveits assigned quota, and it could begin pumping a further500,000 bpd when a new export pipeline comes on stream inSeptember.    According to Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifaal-Sabah, actual OPEC production in the fourth quarter could bewell above the official ceiling at nearly 18 mln bpd. REUTER&#3;
reut2-019.sgm, TECHNOLOGY/ALTERNATIVES TO IBM SOFTWARE STANDARD, In the fast paced personal computerindustry, millions can be made in six months, and such anopportunity may exist now for companies seeking to capitalizeon the delay of a new IBM software standard.    When International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM> announcedits new generation of personal computers, the PS/2 family, inApril, it also decided to establish a new operating system forthe machines, a death sentence for the billions of dollars ofsoftware now in use on the existing system.    Because IBM is the world's largest computer company - some70 pct of the world's computers bear the IBM logo - mostindustry analysts, and even IBM's competitors, expect thatwithin two years the new operating system, called OS/2, will beas commonplace as the current standard, MS-DOS, is now.    "By 1989, at least one half to 60 pct of all personalcomputers will be sold with OS/2," predicted George Colony,president of the consulting firm Forrester Research Inc.    But until then there is an opportunity, some analysts said,for firms selling advanced versions of MS-DOS, specialisedmulti-tasking software packages and Unix, an alternative toMS-DOS developed by American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T>that has developed a following among engineers and the federalgovernment.    OS-2, which IBM is developing with Microsoft Corp, theauthor of MS-DOS, will not be ready for another six months. IBMsaid last week that the product is on schedule but analysts andother software developers are skeptical, since delays in majornew software products are commonplace.    Initial acceptance of the new system will most likely behindered by the disgruntlement of hardware and software vendorsalike, who would prefer to keep making products that work withtried and true MS-DOS, according to Paul Cubbage, softwareanalyst with the market research firm Dataquest Inc.    Compaq, IBM's major personal computer competitor, hasalready said it will stick with the MS-DOS standard. Compaqpresident Rod Canion said recently their will be no "automaticmass migration" to OS/2. "(Advanced MS-DOS) applications willcontinue to meet a far broader set of users needs than OS/2will supply long after it becomes available," he said.    Cubbage acknowledged that "it will probably be a year ormore before any really useful applications are available forOS-2," creating opportunities for multi-tasking programs. "Butthere comes a time when the memory limits of those gets toyou," he said.    IBM's new operating system was as big an event to thecomputer industry as the PS-2 announcement itself. The newcomputers, the most powerful of which will use Intel Corp'sfast 80386 microprocessor, are expected to rejuvenate thesagging sales of the personal computer industry and alreadygave a big boost to IBM.    Company officials said last week that 250,000 PS/2s wereshipped in the 2-1/2 months since their introduction and IBMexpect record pc sales ths year as a result.    The enthusiasm for the PS-2 is particularly striking sincethe full potential of the powerful computers cannot be tappeduntil a new operating system or other high level software isavailable, analysts said.    OS-2 will allow users to work on many different programs,or tasks, at once on a personal computer, ideally without anyslowdown in operation, a capability the industry has longstrived for.    Microsoft is already promising alternatives to OS-2, inparticular an advanced version of its Windows multitaskingprogram, which is used in conjunction with MS-DOS.    Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has suggested an advancedversion of the program, Windows 386, will be announced inSeptember and available six to eight weeks later, at a price of100 dlrs and 300 dlrs. OS/2 is expected to cost 325 dlrs.    Some software developers have said the the program,designed for 80386-based personal computers, may even besuperior to OS/2 in allowing users to multitask applicationswithout disruption.     But several analysts commented that what users really wantis a multi-taksing operating system for 80386-based personalcomputers, and so far that desire has been met primarily by asmall Atlanta software publisher, The Software Link Inc. Inlate spring the company announced PC-MOS/386, a multi-tasking,multiuser operating system that is compatible with MS/DOS andworks on 80386-based computers.    The company said it filled 2,500 orders in the first fourweeks of availability and expects shipments to reach 40,000 byyear end.    International Data Corp analyst Will Zachmann said Unixcould be the most promising alternative to OS/2, even once theIVM system is available.    IBM did not endorse Unix for any of its PS/2 models,although it did say that it would announce a version of itsAdvanced Interactive Executive (AIX), a Unix compatibleoperating system.    But the federal government requires Unix compatability formost of its computer contracts, it is almost certain that othercompanies will provide Unix-style operating systems for the IBMsystems.    ATT itself two weeks ago introduced a version of Unix thatis compatible with the 80386 microprocessor, although not IBM'scomputer specifically.    Analysts saw the announcement as a move to get Unixaccepted as a strong alternative to OS/2 before the IBM systemhas a chance to take off. Reuter&#3;

The company said its business units outside the UnitedStates are not affected by the action.    Allis-Chalmers said the rapid agreement was essential forits restructuring plan, announced March 4.    However, the company said, "agreement could not be workedout within the short time frame available, and it wasdetermined that the only practical alternative was to obtaincourt protection."    "This protection enables us to keep on operating ourbusiness in the ordinary course while affording us time to workout our obligations and complete our operational restructurestrategy."    Allis-Chalmers said the proposal announced in March calledfor a complete restructuring of its obligations and capitalstructure as well as major structural changes in operations.    The company said funds generated by U.S. operations arecurrently inadequate to meet its U.S. obligations, primarilydue to the carryover from discontinued and drasticallydownsized businesses.    It said funds produced by non-U.S. operations are notreadily available to help meet those obligations, which includea health care program for retirees and debt service carriedover from the larger Allis-Chalmers of earlier years.    Allis-Chalmers said its U.S. cash flow exceeded a negative24 mln dlrs in 1986 and was a negative two mln dlrs in thefirst quarter of 1987. The company has financed a portion ofits debt service and other obligations through sales of assetsand has relied on short-term waivers from its lenders toprevent defaults on principal and interest payments.    Because of Allis-Chalmers' financial position, it said, newfinancing facilities were not available outside of Chapter 11,adding substantially all U.S. assets other than inventory arepledged as security for its debts.

In a speech to the 1,500 member body, Ryzhkov saidexcessive central control by Moscow-based ministries andwasteful use of resources had led to a situation where 13 pctof Soviet industrial enterprises were making a loss in 1986.    He said the public faced acute food and housing problemsand a "shadow economy" was growing because the state could notmeet demand.    He added that the USSR had failed to keep up with thetechnology revolution.    "The methods of the past system of economic management havebecome obsolete," Ryzhkov declared. "The need for change isevident and urgent."    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who set the tone lastweek with a frank speech on the economy, was present during thespeech.    The legislation outlined by Ryzhkov, formally called thedraft law on state enterprises, is expected to be approved bythe Supreme Soviet, to take effect next January 1.    Under the law, all enterprises are to become financiallyself-supporting by taking charge of income and outlay, withwages tied to profit in order to increase worker incentive.    Firms will compete for orders from the state, which are dueto decline as direct contracts between enterprises expand.    Ryzhkov said the state planning agency, Gosplan, would berestructured to set national economic priorities instead ofadministering factories directly through five year plans.    "We need a fundamentally new approach to yearly planning," headded, saying annual central plans would be abandoned from 1991and enterprises charged with developing their own plans.    He said scientific research should be integrated closelywith industry to make up a technology gap with the West andenterprises should use market research to meet consumer demand.    Ryzhkov blamed the state supply body, Gossnab, for allowingshortages to occur. He said Gossnab was hoarding 27 billionroubles worth of raw materials and semi-finished products ofenterprises. He said Gossnab should help expand wholesaletrade.    Ryzhkov said improved economic management of consumer goodsand services was required to stem increasing speculation andthe growth of the black market economy. He called for a 10 foldincrease in the number of cooperatives to help in this field.    He said the price system needed radical revision toaccurately reflect supply and demand, with the state settingprices only for "products of national importance" in changes tobe fully in place by the next five year plan beginning in 1991.    The practice of using credit to cover losses must alsostop. Outstanding debts to the state had reached 40 billionroubles.    He said there were proposals to replace the "cumbersome"banking system with six new banks -- a state bank and banks forforeign economic relations, agro-industry, construction,housing and commercial services, and credit.    Ryzhkov said guarantees should be built into the law toprevent "the distortion of the rights of enterprises." Butnon-profitable enterprises would be declared bankrupt ifefforts to make them self-supporting failed.    Bemoaning the "economic illiteracy" of many managers, hecalled for the retraining of economic personnel.    Ryzhkov said an immense amount of work lay ahead and "doingit on the go" would be difficult, but added, "We do not have timeto stop and ponder."    He said the changes should "give a new image to socialism." REUTER&#3;

The current account surplus rose 9.8 pctto 33.7 billion marks.    West Germany reported a 1986 current account surplus of 77billion marks and a trade surplus of 113 billion marks.    Economists had expected the rise of the mark from year-agolevels to have started biting more strongly into the nominalsurpluses.    The real surpluses are already declining. The StatisticsOffice said after cheaper import prices were taken intoconsideration, West Germany's imports by volume rose by morethan three pct in the first five months.    Exports had risen by only about one pct in real terms. Thegovernment has pointed to this stronger real rise in importsthan exports when rejecting international pressure to boostdomestic consumption.    The Statistics Office said West Germany's trade surplus hadrisen in May to 10.6 billion marks, from 8.9 billion in Apriland 8.1 billion in May last year.    The current account surplus had risen to 7.5 billion marksin May from 6.1 billion in April and 6.3 billion marks a yearearlier.    Exports rose strongly from the year-ago month by 6.6 pct to43.31 billion marks, while May imports of 32.76 billion markshad risen only 0.8 pct in the year.    The Ifo economic research institute in Munich said in astudy published today that the trade surplus would probablyonly fall to around 101 billion marks this year, compared withthe 113 billion mark 1986 record.    It predicted a fall in the current account surplus to 61billion marks from 77 billion.    Ifo said this reduction would only be "a small step on theway to reducing imbalances in the world economy."    Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank AG, predicteda 1987 trade surplus of 100 billion marks. He saw a slightlyhigher current account surplus than Ifo of possibly 65 billionmarks.    Helmut Henschel, with Westdeutsche Landesbank, put the 1987trade surplus at 95 billion marks and the current accountsurplus at 60 billion marks.    He said the strong rise in exports in May from the year-agoperiod was surprising but it probably reflected calendarfactors. REUTER&#3;

Texaco said it is pleased and encouraged by the SEC'sdecision, pointing out "Pennzoil's own counsel told the trialcourt that 'If Rule 10B-13 was an impediment, then in fact ourcontract was void' and further that, if the alleged contractwas void, "we have no case.'"    In a letter dated June 26, the SEC's general counsel toldattorneys representing Texaco and Pennzoil the commission willurge the Texas Supreme Court to review the issue of federalsecurities law in the Texaco-Pennzoil case, Texaco said.    "This is to inform you that the commission has determinedto file a brief amicus curiae in the (Texaco-Pennzoil)litigation. The brief will focus on Commission Rule 10b-13 asit applies to the facts of this case, and will urge the TexasSupreme Court to accept the case for review with respect tothat issue," the letter said.    The SEC's general counsel said, "we currently anticipatethat the brief will be filed around the week of July 20."    An issue concerning SEC Rule 10b-13 is part of Texaco'sapplication for a Writ of Error, which was filed with the TexasSupreme Court on June 15, the company said.    "The SEC rule prohibits private agreements or arrangementsto purchase a target company's stock while a tender offer by aprospective purchaser is pending," the company's statement said.       In its application to the Texas Supreme Court, Texaco said,it points out that "on the day that Pennzoil made its allegedagreement to purchase Getty Oil stock (Jan. 3, 1984), it(Pennzoil) had outstanding a public tender offer for Getty Oilstock."

reut2-019.sgm, REAGAN SAID OPEN TO DEAL ON 1988 U.S. TAX RISE, President Reagan is willingto compromise with Democrats in Congress on a plan to raise newfederal revenues next year if they back his plan to reform thebudget process, White House Budget Chief James Miller said.    "If the Democrats want to insist that the president saywhatever is agreed to is a tax increase, then they'd betterjust forget it because he's not going to do that," Miller saidin an interview with Reuters.    "But there are a lot of revenues other than those thepresident proposed (in his January budget plan), I think, thatwe might look seriously at," he added.    The Reagan budget, which has been widely criticized by bothDemocrats and Republicans in Congress, envisages raising 22billion dlrs in new revenues through the sale of a package ofgovernment assets and new fees on certain federal services.    President Reagan has repeatedly vowed to veto any taxincrease voted by Congress for the 1988 financial year, arguingthat cutting domestic spending was a better way to reduce thehuge federal deficit.    The deficit, which totaled 221 billion dlrs last year, isexpected to decline to about 175 billion dlrs this year andwould fall to about 140 billion dlrs next year under a budgetblueprint recently approved by Congress.    The one trillion dlr congressional budget plan containsabout 19 billion dlr in additional revenues from new taxes inthe government's budgetary year beginning October 1.    The plan does not say how the additional revenues are to beraised, leaving it to the House Ways and Means and SenateFinance committees to fill in the details later this year.    Miller appeared to be signaling that the president mightconsider some sort of tax increase despite his frequentlystated rejection of the concept.    However, Miller declined to say which new revenue sourcesmight be acceptable to the president.    "I think it would be counterproductive for me to (set outoptions) which might suggest that we have one thing or anotherin mind," the White House budget chief said.    He cautioned Congress about the political repercussions ofcertain moves, such as raising excise taxes on beer, cigarettesor telephone service, or raising corporate or personal incometax rates.    "I think that those in Congress who think it will be asimple matter to go along with some increase in excise taxesare underestimating what they would be getting themselves into,"he said.

Before agreeing to a revenue package, the president wouldinsist on reform of the budget process, Miller said.    "The president is not going to take a sucker punch. He's notgoing to sit down and try to negotiate out a budget when wecan't be sure that whatever the president agrees to in factwill be delivered," he emphasized.    "We'd like to have a budget process that gives us acontract, so that if the president agrees to something, he candepend on its coming through."    After returning to the United States from the economicsummit in Venice earlier this month, President Reagan revivedan earlier unsuccessful campaign for budget reform, calling fora constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and thepower -- called a "line-item veto" -- to block individual itemsin congressional spending bills.    At the Venice summit, U.S. trading partners called onWashington to cut its budget deficit to help reduce globaltrade imbalances.       Miller told an Italian journalist here yesterday that U.S.trading partners "have to have faith and trust in the ability ofthe United tates to deal with its problems."    He said a deficit cut of about 40 to 45 billion dlrs a year"is about the optimal rate of reduction in the deficit. I don'tthink we can end the deficit overnight... I think we've got tohave a gradual reduction over a period of several years." Miller is in Beaver Creek attending the sixth annual WorldForum, a gathering of current and former government officialsand business representatives discussing world economic andpolitical issues.

reut2-019.sgm, CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW, U.S. moves to increase its warships inand around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks onunprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking adirect military clash with Iran, diplomats said.    They said the American decision inevitably carries somerisk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its bluntrhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.    "As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into theGulf could do serious damage," said one western diplomat.    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attackson "soft targets" such as merchant shipping not protected byAmerican or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oiltankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is ratedby diplomats as low. However, "There is the threat that theIranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,will go for softer targets," one diplomat said.    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali AkbarHashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us."    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri topatrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escortingKuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registeredto fly the American flag to give them naval protection.    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack byIran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed byChinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran ispreparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely tomake Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up alaunching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in theFaw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.    "But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaititerritory would be a very serious escalation" likely movingworld opinion against Iran, remarked one.    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carryingout reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predictedlast Friday "a river of blood" throughout the world in the eventof any U.S. strike against Iran.    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accusedof being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrablecapacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now thatmost Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked topro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potentialtrouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage orother action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added. Reuter&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES, The Securities and ExchangeCommission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptlydisclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart atakeover attempt by Campeau Corp.    In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and itslegal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and theagency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shoppingcenter developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau'stakeover offer.    Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrson Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.    On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board hadurged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs ashare, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shoppingcenters to DeBartolo, the SEC said.    Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who headsthe merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm ofSullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SECfiling to disclose the talks even though they had resulted insales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.    Securities law requires takeover target companies topromptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.    The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pctof Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs ashare from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headedby DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed atthwarting Campeau, the SEC said.    Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in anamended SEC filing, the agency charged.    Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover wasmade on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaintsaid.    DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle forcontrol of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in Octoberwhen it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutesafter it dropped its hostile tender offer.    The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federaljudge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake inAllied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joiningwith Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegaltender offer.    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case wasdropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they complywith reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since itbecame a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual andquarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt. Reuter&#3;

The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiationsbetween the United States and the Netherlands over the pasteight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesmansaid.    The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies ofEurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will nolonger be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, thespokesman said.

He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have anadverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the generaldecline in interest rates means they will be able to refinanceat lower interest rates.

The company said the country's prospects for economicgrowth had improved in the past few months after two years ofdeep recession, but cautioned that the economic outlook washeavily dependent on a solution to South Africa's politicalturmoil.

The South African government this year is targeting threepct real growth in gross domestic product against an increaseof less than one pct last year.    "A moderate rate of growth in the year ahead should not giverise to strains on the balance payments, provided there is nota substantial deterioration in export earnings or anacceleration of capital outflows," Anglo American said.

The group also said that "reliance on negative AIDS testresults to determine when to take specific precautions can leadto a false sense of security among health care workers."    So far there are nine cases on record of hospital workerscontracting AIDS from hospital patients. Despite the low riskof contracting, the group said, "Hospital workers areunderstandly concerned about their vulnerability (to AIDS)."    There are 3.6 mln workers in the nation's hospitals withnurses and housekeepers the most likely to come in contact withblood and body fluids on a daily basis, the group said.

reut2-019.sgm, CANADA SETS OFF ITS OWN BIG BANG, stockmarket deregulation -- will be heard Tuesday when the Canadiansecurities industry sets off its own fireworks.    Some companies are quickly taking advantage ofderegulation, but more significant moves are likely to be ayear or more down the road, analysts say.    They say most foreign firms will focus at first on bondtrading, debt financing and underwriting, areas in which theyhave experience under the old rules that allowed them toprovide government debt financing and advisory services.    "When they learn about Canada, they might go into retail,"said Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada. "Then they will eventuallyjust start to buy up the little guys. If the bigger boys' pricecomes down, they'll end up taking those ones over too."    Under the new rules, barriers that kept banks, brokeragehouses, insurance companies and trust firms out of each others'businesses will be swept away in favor of wide-opencompetition.    The deregulation, sometimes nicknamed "Little Bang," willallow Canadian banks and other domestic financial institutionsto set up securities units or acquire existing brokerages.    Foreign companies will also be able to form their ownsecurities divisions in Ontario or buy up to 50 pct of aCanadian firm. A year from now they can raise that stake to 100pct. Foreign firms that entered Canada after 1971 can currentlyown no more than 10 pct of a Canadian brokerage.    Deregulation was expected to generate a major shakeout byJune 30, involving mergers of existing firms and buyouts byforeign and domestic financial giants.    So far few deals have become reality, however, despite aswirl of rumors and merger talks. In the heat of deregulationfever, many Canadian investment dealers are demanding up tofour times book value, scaring off prospective suitors,analysts said.    "I would think they (the brokerages) will have to lowertheir asking prices," said financial services analyst JeffCarney at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., which recently terminatedtalks to acquire prominent Canadian brokerage Burns Fry Ltd.    "I think (a high asking price) is what scared Merrill Lynchaway from Burns Fry," added Carney. "It is just a lot of money.When your asset walks out the door every night, it is difficultto pay that amount of cash."    Carney said another factor in the slow pace of buyouts wasuncertainty about the final deregulation rules, which wereissued and approved only in mid-June.    Most major foreign and Canadian financial players havefocused their deregulation strategy on planning their ownCanadian securities units or buying seats on the Toronto StockExchange, Canada's largest equities market.    Japan's Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Yamaichi Securities Co.Ltd., Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. and Nikko Securities Co. Ltd.recently bought seats on Toronto's exchange, while UnitedStates investment banks such as Salomon Inc. and Goldman, Sachsand Co. have set plans for Canadian subsidiaries.    The few proposed foreign investments in Ontario firmsinclude agreements by New York's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.to raise its stake in McLeod Young Weir Ltd. to 30 pct from 10pct and by the British firm of James Capel and Co. to acquire aminority interest in Brown, Baldwin, Nisker Ltd.    Several industry watchers predict the flood of foreignacquisitions is likely a year away, when the newcomers becomefamiliar with Canada.    Canadian firms will need such international alliances tocompete in the increasingly global securities market, industryofficials said.    "That is one of the hopes of the regulators, that the changewill throw off one or two Canadian global firms," Toronto StockExchange president Pearce Bunting told Reuters recently.    Canada's six major banks are also expected to proceedcautiously into the securities field.    Analysts said the brokers are too expensive now while thebanks are coping with Brazilian loan problems. Banks will alsofind it tough to merge their cautious, bureaucratic culturewith that of leaner, more free-wheeling securities dealers,they said.    While the banks have been approached by securities firmsseeking merger partners, they have not yet bought intobrokerages, choosing to build securities units from within.    Last week, Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggestbank, ended merger talks with Canadian broker Wood Gundy Inc.after several months of negotiations.    But analyst Thompson forecast that if one bank finallyacquires an existing firm, "all the other banks will jump in.    "They don't want to be perceived as missing out onsomething," said Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd. analystAlbert Thompson, who believes that brokerages are too expensivea risk for banks.

reut2-019.sgm, SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING, Corporate mergers and acquisitionsin and around San Francisco over the past seven years have hadonly a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, aleading business-backed organization said.    The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 businessfirms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in anine-county area found that San Francisco itself had sufferedsome ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surroundingcommunities had not.    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area leftdue to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, butanother 21 firms were added to the list.    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.During the period, only six located in the city achievedFortune 500 status.    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director ofMcKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the studygrew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriouslyhurt the economic climate of northern California.    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had beenlost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs werecreated during the period.    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greaterrise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the restof the United States and California.    Council President George Keller, who also is chairman andchief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a newsconference that the region had difficulties in persuadingcompanies to locate there because of a fragmented localpolitical system.    But he said that because of the amenities of living in SanFrancisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in othermetropolitan area.    "It's a great place to run a business," he added, "but it'sa hell of a place to do business with government."    The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with GulfOil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from therestructuring activity.    Among the corporate headquarters lost during the periodwere Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;Cooke and Rolm.    Companies that grew enough during the period to make theFortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.    The study by the management consulting firm said that,partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growthin San Francisco has slowed since 1980.    In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadershiphad adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic andcharitable activities. Reuter&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, CHEVRON N.SEA FIND MAY HOLD 300 MLN BBLS -ANALYSTS, A North Sea oil find announced by ChevronCorp's &lt;CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate anew field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mlnbarrels, industry analysts said.    Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 APIcrude oil from the tertiary "Alba" sand through a three-inchsurface choke.    "The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320mln barrels," Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grievesonand Co told Reuters.    He said industry estimates put the total reserves at thefield at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity ofoil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25pct.    Analysts said the results were encouraging, but thepotential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in thefield was shown by the fact that the first well had to beplugged and a sidetrack drilled.    "The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which willrequire a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costsup," Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.    Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oilfound would require additional costs in recovery, the test wellshowed that it flows well.    "Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could berecovered," Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.    However, Chevron officials declined to comment on theanalysts' reserve estimates. They said that without furtherresearch and drilling in the area this summer, they would notdisclose any reserve figures.    Analysts said that if the field were declared commercialand developed, there would be a ready local market for theheavy crude it produced.    "Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils andthe price differentials between heavy and light crudes are alot narrower today," Osborne said.    Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies whichinclude British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons(UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet. (GB) Ltdand Phillips Petroleum Co U.K. Ltd. Reuter&#3;

Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.    "We will be producing more than the quota to pay off thecrude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria andKuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable toproduce during the past few months," he said.

"They understood our position and we believe we remainwithin the spirit of the (quota) agreement," he said.

reut2-019.sgm, U.S. LEADS JAPAN IN FINANCIAL FUTURES BUSINESS, U.S. firms are expected to enjoy theadvantage of superior experience over their Japanesecompetitors in the new, promising business of bringing assetrich Japanese investors to the U.S. financial futures markets.    Japan allowed local financial institutions last month tostart using overseas futures in currencies, bonds and stocks tohelp them manage their bulging foreign portfolios.    "U.S. investment banks are going to take advantage. We'vebeen in the business for two decades, the Japanese have not,"said Eugene Atkinson, president of Goldman, Sachs Japan Corp.       Japanese investors were assumed to be eager to get into thenew markets, but in fact participation so far has been slow,Japanese securities and bank sources in New York said.    Koichi Kane, Executive Vice President of Nomura SecuritiesInternational, said, "They're still in a starting up period."    "They're testing the water," Atkinson added. But once theystart, the Japanese are likely to become very big players,opening up lucrative business opportunities, he said.    U.S. investment banking sources said the slow start isunderstandable because U.S. institutional investors, too, arefairly new to the market.       Futures markets have a long history in the U.S., butbecause of the high risks involved American pension funds andmutual funds were not allowed to use the markets untilrelatively recently, a U.S. investment bank futures analystsaid.    In addition to Japan's inexperience in financial futures,an insufficient number of brokers in Japan is also to be blamedfor the slow start, the Japanese sources said.       Japan is liberalizing its financial markets, but domesticfinancial institutions are still not allowed to act as brokersin Japan for overseas futures markets.    This may change next year, when bankers speculate thatsecurities houses will be permitted to enter this line ofbusiness.    While the Japanese are out of the business, the Americanshave moved in, with First Boston Corp, Salomon Brothers Inc,Goldman, Sachs and Co, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc andPainWebber Inc leading the charge, they said.       In the U.S., Nikko Securities Co International Inc ispreparing to become a clearing member of the Chicago Boad ofTrade (CBT)in anticipation of growing Japanese demand forfutures products, Akira Tokutomi of Nikko said.    Nomura, Japan's largest securities house, has not yetdecided whether to expand its futures brokerage business in theU.S. to establish closer links between Japanese investors andthe U.S. futures markets, Kane said.    The evening session of CBT, inaugurated recently tocoincide with early Tokyo business hours, has increasedJapanese participation to some extent, but the brokerage issueis still a hurdle, the Japanese sources said.       High liquidity is the biggest attraction of the futuresmarket, so the Japanese naturally want to join the daytimetrading session in Chicago if possible, they said.    The Japanese are in the process of selecting brokers andestablishing channels to pay fees and margins, but harmonizingclerical procedures and bridging the time gap between Tokyo andChicago are proving to be a burden, the sources said.    Some Japanese banks, which are largely barred from thesecurities industry in Japan, have contemplated buying into theU.S. brokerage business, the Japanese sources said.        One of the motives for doing so is to save on commissions,which was also a spur for U.S. commercial banks to get into thebrokerage business, they said.    "The simplest way may be to take over a brokerage house orto go into a business tie-up," said Hiroyuki Kondo of YasudaTrust and Banking Co Ltd in New York.    One trust bank source said total fees could amount toaround one mln dlrs a year if his bank used the futures marketsfully to hedge its huge pension fund and other assets.    Japanese banks have been able to penetrate aggressivelymany foreign financial markets by mobilizing their mammothcapital assets, but the futures brokerage business to be adifferent story, Japanese banking sources said.    They cited stiff fee-cutting competition in addition todifficulties recruiting influential Chicago brokers.    In anticipation of sizeable orders in the future, some U.S.brokers are now taking orders from the Japanese at around 13dlrs per contract, below the break-even level, they said.    Some Chicago brokers and brokerage houses are trying toapproach Japanese financial institutions about possibletie-ups, a futures indusry source in Chicago said.    But Japanese bank sources in New York said the smallcapital base of many of these brokerages is making the Japanesenervous about a capital link.    Japanese banks are unlikely to ignore the brokeragebusiness once financial futures trading by the Japanese startsgrowing fast and proves to be profitable, they said.    But the big question, they added, is whether the Japanesegovernment would let banks engage in this new risky business. reuter&#3;

It said that it intended to carry out a reorganization bydisposing of businesses that do not contribute adequately tocash flow. The company said it plans to eliminate unprofitableproduct lines and emphasize more profitable product lines.    Allis-Chalmers said it intended to obtain workforcereductions and seek monetary and other concessions fromsalaried and hourly employees.    It said it will eliminate operations of facilities that aremarginal performers. The company said it plans to discontinueburdensome contracts and leases as well as collectivebargaining agreements.    The company said it believes creditors will realize morefrom a reorganization than from a liquidation.    The documents said Allis-Chalmers has suffered substantiallosses since 1981 due to sales declines caused by fiercecompetition and a sluggish global economy.    It said a restructuring plan, which it has already instituted, adversely affected cash flow because certain costsincluding product liability and retiree medical and pensioncosts continued as before despite a reduction in the size ofits business.

reut2-019.sgm, EPA TO REJECT CLEAN-AIR PLANS FOR 14 AREAS, The Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) announced plans to disapprove clean-air plans for 14metropolitan areas and called for bans in those areas on newconstruction of potentially polluting facilties.    EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said in a statement the areashad not shown they could meet agency ozone or carbon-monoxideair-quality standards by the end of 1987 or soon after.    He said the proposed ban on construction would cover suchindustries as electric utilities, iron and steel productionplants, industrial boilers and petroleum refineries.    The areas affected are Chicago; the Indiana portion of theChicago area; East St. Louis, Ill.; the Indiana portion of theLouisville, Ky., area; Cleveland, Ohio; Atlanta, Ga.;Dallas-Ft. Worth, Tex.; Denver, Colo.; the California southcoast, including Los Angeles; Fresno, Sacramenta, Ventura andKern counties, Calif., and Washoe County (Reno), Nev.    Thomas also proposed major changes to existing sources ofpollution in those areas.  They would effective after a finalassessment of the area's pollution, expected late this year orearly next.    For Cleveland, the EPA also proposed a restriction onfederal highway funding and clean-air grants because the stateof Ohio did not provide for adequate testing to curb carpollutions as required by the Clean AirAct.    Thomas said:    "It is clear that the state implementation plans for theseareas will not achieve federal ozone or carbon-monoxidestandards under the deadline mandated by Congress. In thesecircumstances the Clean Air Act leaves no discretion.  I mustpropose sanctions."    The EPA estimated that another 20 metropolitan areas willfail to meet the agency's ozone standards by the end of theyear. About 70 are meeting the ozone standards.    It added that about 80 areas are now not meeting the EPAcarbon-monoxide standards, but only a few will have long-termproblems in meeting the standards.    The EPA has proposed that car-makers be ordered to installcanisters on new cars beginning in 1979 to capture pollutinggasoline vapors which escape when gas is pumped from fillingstations to a car's gas tank. reuter&#3;

The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key toproviding a solution to a long-term settlement of theCommunity's worst-ever budget crisis.    "The Germans clearly do not want to budge," an aide to Chiractold reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visiblyangered as he the hour-long meeting.    Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal forthe Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically theEC's complex "green" currrency system, designed to translatecommon EC farm prices into national currencies.    Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax whichWest Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and theNetherlands.    EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on thepackage, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadlinetomorrow.

reut2-019.sgm, VENEZUELA LOWERS EXCHANGE RATE FOR OIL EARNINGS, Venezuela's cabinet approved a newexchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.    Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that themeasure is "fundamental to conserving the economic and financialstrength of the petroleum industry."     He said the new exchange rate, which goes before thecentral bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the stateoil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve itsproblem of working capital and implement investment plans,estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say whenthe measure would become effective.   Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earningsto the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreignexchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.   The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domesticgoods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added thatit would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase moregovernment debt bonds.                            PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars atthe start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trustfund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed ingovernment bonds.  According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries byrepurchasing the bonds.

"Although no such proposal has yet been developed, thedirectors hope that such a result can be achieved," chairmanHugh Macaulay said at the annual meeting.    The committee, formed last fall, has been trying todetermine the voting rights of class A non-voting shares ifcontrol of the company changes hands.       The Ontario Securities Commission blocked a 270 mln dlrtakeover bid last January for 49 pct of the company's commonshares.    The OSC said the bid by a group of Canadian Tire storeowners abused shareholders rights by circumventing shareprovisions that would convert non-voting stock into votingshares if more than 50 pct of the stock changed ownership.    Since then, three members of the Billes family, who agreedto tender their 60 pct holding of Canadian Tire's common sharesto the pro rata offer, have commenced legal proceedings amongstthemselves.    Macaulay said he would not comment further on the situation"while matters remain in an unsettled state".

reut2-019.sgm, INTEREST RATES HURT U.S. MAY HOUSING SALES, Sales of new single-family homestumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of highermortgage interest rates, analysts said.    "There should be another month or two of very weak new homesales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homesshould become more stable by mid-summer," said economistLawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.    The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the CommerceDepartment said.    Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out atabout 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.    The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers outof the market, he and others said.    "The rates moved very suddenly and were certainlyunexpected by homebuyers," said Cynthia Latta, an economistwith Data Resources. "They were so startled, they wanted tohold back and see what would happen."    The drop in sales of new single-family home sales wassharper than expected, some economists said. "We fully expecteda decline but the extent was more than we anticipated," saidJames Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions.    Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales ofexisting homes, which are generally less expensive than newhomes.    Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of newcondominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast werereflected in sales of existing but not new homes.    Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,"Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the marketis going to stabilize and give us a good second half."    Others were less optimistic, however.    "We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but Idon't think this is the start of a collapse in single-familyhousing," said Chimerine of Wharton.    Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home LoanBank of New York, said, "The lower sales level will bemaintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.There won't be much specific improvement in coming months."

reut2-019.sgm, BRAZIL LAND REFORM PROGRAM FALTERS, TENSIONS RISE, Brazil's land reform program, longtrumpeted by the government as one of its absolute priorities,is mired in bureaucracy after achieving very few of its aims.    Officials acknowledge that progress is now minimal. Landrights activists see no progress at all and say things areactually worsening. Over the last year economic pressures haveforced many small producers to sell out to big land-owners.    Land reform, one of the country's most hotly-debatedpolitical issues, is particularly to the fore this year as aConstituent Assembly in Brasilia draws up a new constitution.    Land rights campaigners say that if the new charter doesnot give fresh hope for the country's 4.5 mln landlessfamilies, there will be wave upon wave of land occupations.    "We make no secret of our tactics," said one leader of theland reform movement, Joao Pedro. "The solution is to occupy --that is what we say to the rural workers. There has not been asingle program of land reform in the world without the peopleoccupying land."    The land issue spawns violence from Amazonia to MatoGrosso. Some 278 people died in land disputes last year,according to the Pastoral Commission for Land, which is linkedto the Roman Catholic Church.    The land reform program, announced in 1985 soon after thecivilian government of President Jose Sarney took power, aimedto resettle 1,4 mln families by 1989 by gradually splitting upthe country's vast, undeveloped estates.    The government, in its National Plan for Agrarian Reform,described the program as "one of its absolute priorities."    In practice, fewer than 20,000 families have been helped sofar and the government admits that it will not get anywherenear the original target.    Political analysts said that the pace of land reform wasnow slower under Sarney than it had been under the militarygovernment of General Joao Figueiredo (1979-85).    The slow progress on the issue is fuelling deepfrustration. Land rights demonstrations are a common sight inSao Paulo and other parts of the country.    Activists say social conditions in the countryside, farfrom improving, have significantly deteriorated.    Pedro, a leader of the Movement of Landless Rural Workers,said that over the last 12 months 100,000 small producers hadbeen forced off the land in Brazil's five southernmost states.    He said the exodus had been caused first by thegovernment's anti-inflation Cruzado Plan, which last year frozeprices and hit the income of small farmers.    When the Cruzado Plan collapsed late last year, prices andinterest rates soared and many small farmers were unable to paydebts taken out during the price freeze.    Pedro said most of the 100,000 families who had left thecountryside in the south had previously been land-owners, whilea minority had been tenant farmers. Most had moved to Brazil'sswollen cities.    One activist said the number of landless day labourerscalled "boias-frias" (literally "cold meals"), most of whom cutsugar cane, had increased to 400,000 in Sao Paulo state fromabout 300,000 five years ago.    In an attempt to improve the lot of the rural poor, theland reform movement has drawn up a radical proposal which itis sending to the Constituent Assembly.    The proposal would severely limit the size of a maximumpermissible holding and the land rights movement does notexpect it to be voted into the constitution.    Pedro said at least 70 pct of the 559-member assembly iscomposed of big land-owners. He added that the assembly wouldprobably vote on the proposal by October and that its rejectionwould be the signal for large-scale land invasions. Reuter&#3;

"I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, thatwe're going to be assuring safety for American shipping andthat that shipping is not related to the war itself," StateDepartment spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.    He was asked about Iranian claims that the United Stateswas moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.    Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar HashemiRafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,"At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink ofan armed encounter with us.    "We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. Weare determined to stand firm and will certainly win."    The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up itsGulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending therefurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside thestrategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.    The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oiltankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flagand gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.

reut2-019.sgm, TEXACO (QTX) MAY BENEFIT FROM SEC BRIEF, The Securities and ExchangeCommission's entry into the battle between Texaco Inc andPennzoil Co &lt;PZL> could affect the outcome of the 10.3 billiondlr legal saga, some analysts said.    Texaco today said the SEC would file a "friend of thecourt" brief on the tender offer rule as it pertains to thecase. Some analysts construed this as positive for Texaco sincethey said it is alleged by Texaco that Pennzoil violated therule, and the issue was not thoroughly addressed in lower Texascourts.    Texaco's stock rose 1-1/2 to 39-3/8 and Pennzoil fell fourto 78-7/8. A Pennzoil attorney would not comment. He said theSEC rule, 10b-13, is part of Texaco's argument in its requestfor a Texas Supreme Court case, and that the matter has beenpreviously addressed in court. Pennzoil said it knew of the SECbrief but it did not know whether the brief would support theview of one litigant or be an inquiry and request forclarification of the reasons for two lower state courtdecisions.    Texaco today said the SEC would urge the Texas SupremeCourt to accept the case for review with respect to the issue.    Texaco has alleged Pennzoil violated the rule when it had atender offer for Getty Oil Co outstanding and then made analleged agreement on January 3, 1984, to buy Getty shares.    Analysts said the SEC tender offer rule prevents thosemaking the offer from entering into contracts for the targetcompany's stock. Frederick Leuffer of C.J. Lawrence believesSEC intervention could be meaningful but acknowledged it couldalso have no affect. "If this friend of the court brief ispotent and clearly pro-Texaco, and is taken into account by theTexas Supreme Court, there is a chance the entire judgmentcould be reversed and Pennzoil gets nothing," Leuffer said.    Texaco and Pennzoil have been locked in a bitter legalbattle over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil. A Texas courtawarded Pennzoil a record 10.53 billion dlrs in damages, laterreduced by two billion dlrs. With interest, the award nowtotals 10.3 billion dlrs.    Texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federalbankruptcy laws earlier this year. Its action was designed toavoid having a Texas appeals court order it to post a securitybond for the entire amount of the Pennzoil judgement.    Texaco earlier said the SEC will file its brief the week ofJuly 20.    In his comments, Leuffer also reflected the views of otheranalysts who believe are not convinced the SEC will play asignificant role. "The other argument is the court will ignoreit (the SEC brief) as it has all the other friend of the courtbriefs," he said.    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Marc Cohen said he does notexpect the SEC's brief to change the direction of the case."Everyday, you're going to see something like this," Cohensaid.    Texaco lawyer Jim Sales said it was only logical to believethat the SEC would have sought to intervene in the case if itbelieved the 10b-13 rule was involved. "I think what the marketsensed today is that there is a reminder here for Pennzoil thatthey may reach for the stars and fall on their face," Salessaid. "They (Pennzoil) have won every case in Texas," said JoelFischer of Drexel Burnham Lambert. But Fischer and otheranalysts said SEC involvement may raise questions of federallaw that could help Texaco take its case to the U.S. SupremeCourt if the Texas court does not reverse the lower opinions orrefuses to hear its case.    Analysts said the lower courts did not give much weight tothe 10b-13 issue.    Sales said the point was argued and the courts"acknowledged that it was there but they really ignored thelegal affect of what the regulation required, and we hope wecan correct that misimpression".    Wall Street analysts and arbitragers speculated on manypossible outcomes. One arbitrager said there was concern thatTexaco and Pennzoil could settle for a lower sum than demandedby Pennzoil.    "The SEC stepping in on this issue as an amicus curiae(friend of the court) has a lot of arbitragers a little bitdisturbed," said Cohen.    "What you're seeing is a continual chess game. Every slightmove down the road could have a multiplying effect," he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, FERC SEEKS STAY OF MIDDLE SOUTH &lt;MSU> RULING, Middle South Utilities Inc said theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission has requested a 30-daystay of a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling ordering the commissionto reconsider its allocation of costs from the Grand Gulf Onenuclear power plant.    More than two years ago, FERC set the allocation af GrandGulf capacity and costs among the four Middle South operatingcompanies. These allocations, in turn, have become the basisfor contested rate filings the four operating utilities made toregulators in their service areas.    In a ruling dated June 24 and distributed June 26, the U.S.Court of Appeals in Washington reversed its January 1987decision and ordered FERC to explain its criteria fordetermining undue discrimination and why the FERC's allocationcurrently in effect is not unduly discriminatory under thatdefinition, Middle South said.    The company said the ruling by the three-judge appealscourt panel "was totally unexpected, especially in light of thetimetable the full 11-member court set in April of this yearwhen it announced that all judges would rehear the panel'sJanuary decision in which the panel had upheld FERC.    In essence, Middle South said, "the three-member panel hasadopted the dissenting opinion as the new majority opinion, andthe full court has accepted the new decision."    The company said it supports FERC's motion for a stay. Thecommission said it needed the time to determine the appropriatecourse it should take in light of the new court decision.    "Given its complexity and the need for clarification by theFERC, the significance of this latest order will take time todetermine," Middle South said in a statement. Reuter&#3;

reut2-019.sgm, ISRAEL MINISTER SEES INCREASED EXPORTS TO U.S., Israel's exports to the U.S. can andmust double over the next five years if the mideast nation'sgoal of economic independence is to be achieved, said GadYaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.    Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerceseminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's totalexports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billiondlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.    "I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reachfive billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn tofunction in the American marketplace and place greater emphasison product quality," Yaacobi said.    While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis Europeancurrencies is a "bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,"Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trendtoward higher U.S. exports.    In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rosefivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, whileimports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.    Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pctannually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.     He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passedlast year and eliminating all duties and other commercialrestrictions between the two nations through 1994, wouldcontinue to facilitate the desired export growth.    Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act asan economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentageof the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.    Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middleeast was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been ableto achieve its economic potential.    Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs inaid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financingmilitary conflicts "which were imposed on Israel," he said.    Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economicindependence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption thatexports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

Under the agreement the companies said Continental willacquire General Tire, including its related domestic andforeign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for themedical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retiredon or before November 30, 1984.    The sale is expected to be completed on or before Novemberone and is subject to meeting certain conditions.    Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Lastyear, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9billion dlrs generated by its tire operations.    Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mlndlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operatingprofits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.    GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retainabout 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tireemployees under the agreement.    Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale toreduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.    In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by apartnership formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner andBrown with a restructuring program that included the purchaseof up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrsa share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs    As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it plannedto sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKOGeneral Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcastproperties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotivecomponents businesses.       Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrsin after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale ofseveral pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,including general tire.    "The price paid for General tire would not cause us toreevaluate that estimate," said Tilden.    General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has fourtire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.    In a statemnet, A.

reut2-019.sgm, U.S. HOUSING DEPT. BACKS PRIVATIZING FNMA &lt;FNM>, The U.S. Department of Housing andUrban Development (HUD) said it backed an eventual severing ofthe link between the government and the Federal NationalMortgage Association -- better known as Fannie Mae.    But the department, in a long-awaited report requested byCongress in 1984, shied from setting a timetable for the gianthousing finance institution to end its government ties.   Instead, it said specific recommendations would come in asecond report, to be issued jointly by Fannie Mae and HUD byOct. 1.   "The basic policy directive underlying FNMA's history hasbeen consistent -- a gradual movement toward fully privatestatus. There appears to be no need to change that policy," theHUD report said.    Any change in Fannie Mae's status would be up to Congress.    The HUD report said the options open to Congress rangedfrom doing nothing to full and immediate privatization.    "Whatever option is selected, the combination of thefavorable economic environment, FNMA's recent move to financialhealth, the current strength of the housing market and theevolution of FNMA's role in the mortgage market fromcontributor to competitor would all indicate that the time isripe for a positive move toward privatization," the reportconcluded.    Fannie Mae operated as a part of the federal governmentfrom the time it was created in 1938 until 1968, when it wasrechartered by Congress and put under private ownership withgovernment backing.    However, "it was always intended that FNMA would eventuallybecome fully private," the HUD report said.    Fannie Mae's critics, including some Reagan administrationofficials espousing a free-market philosophy, say governmentsponsorship of the agency allows it to compete unfairly withprivate lenders and investors.    But its backers claim mortgage rates would be pushed up ashigher agency costs were eventually passed on to home buyers.    Fannie Mae was created by Congress to make capitalavailable for housing by buying mortgages from lenders andpackaging them as securities to sell investors. Reuter&#3;

Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech the government had also decided to allowduty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industrymore competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export ofPakistani products.       Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s.    But Haq said now the private sector would also exportcotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets along-standing demand of the local traders.    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed tobring down prices and help the local ancillary industriescompete effectively in the world market, he said.       Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years butreviewed every year.    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcingtrade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it wouldenable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over alonger period.    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been providedfor the export of engineering goods to selected third worldcountries on soft credit terms.       Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 percent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.    He said the government policy was to rationalise andstreamline import controls.

The company said the move, which is being made to coverloans to developed countries, will result in a loss of around313 mln dlrs in the second quarter ending June 30.

reut2-019.sgm, LIMITED IMPACT SEEN FROM U.S. TAX ACCORD ACTION, A U.S. decision ending a forty-yeartax treaty covering the Netherlands Antilles was unlikely tohave a major impact on the Eurobond market, tax experts said.    Most U.S. firms stopped using financial subsidiariesincorporated in the Netherlands Antilles to sell to theEurobond market in July, 1984, the experts said.    But the decision affects Eurobonds issued before July 1984involving principal worth an estimated 30 billion dlrs and willprobably mean those bonds will be called before their maturitydate, they said.    Since most of the bonds are currently trading at a premium,calling them in early will mean a loss in market value for thebondholders, according to a Treasury official who asked not tobe identified.    The official said the Treasury Department was currentlyunsure about the impact of the move on the Eurobond market.    "We are monitoring the situation and receiving reports frominvestors and issuers," the official said.    Earlier, the Treasury said it notified the Netherlands ofthe termination of the treaty effective January 1, 1988.    For years, U.S. firms seeking to avoid a 30 pct withholdingtax used financial subsidiaries incorporated in the NetherlandsAntilles to sell Eurobonds, which are bonds issued abroad by anoverseas financial subsidiary.    But most companies have since taken advantage of a 1984change in the law known as the exemption for portfolio interestthat allows them to sell directly in the Eurobond market andavoid the withholding tax.    The 1984 tax change sharply reduced the number of U.S.companies using the Netherlands Antilles to sell Eurobonds,said Steven Hannes of accounting firm Touche Ross and Co.    Ending the tax treaty will mean that some foreignersinvesting in the U.S. through the Netherlands Antilles willlose tax benefits and probably change their portfolios, Hannessaid.    He said the decision would mainly affect foreign investorswho sought tax advantages because they reside in countrieswhich do not have a tax treaty with the United States.    These investors typically reside in countries in the MiddleEast, Central and South America, he said.    Some of them may withdraw their U.S. investments or seektax relief through the Netherlands itself or Switzerland, butthe choices are limited, Hannes said.    "It is conceivable their investment may stay here. Theywould bear some of the tax that has not been borne in thepast," Hannes said.    U.S. domestic bonds are not affected by the change.    U.S. companies with Eurobonds issued through theNetherlands Antilles are expected to call them early to avoidthe tax liability, a Treasury Department spokesman said. Butthey could refinance at lower rates because of the generaldecline in interest rates, so the Department does not expectU.S. firms to be hurt by the decision, the spokesman said.Negotiations between the United States and the Netherlandscontinued without success since the late 1970's. Thedifferences centered on U.S. concern over residents of thirdcountries avoiding U.S. taxes by using the treaty with theNetherlands Antilles. Reuter&#3;

Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by theFederal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and showsits serious intent to penetrate the California market.    The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach intoSouthern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California.    "This marks our first major expansion in California,particularly in the south," said Citicorp Savings PresidentEdward Valencia, in a statement.    Thrift industry sources said they do not see a majornear-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, butdo expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor thanSears was in that market.    "We do believe they will be a better competitor thanSears," said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of HomeFederal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD>, based in San Diego.    Banking industry sources said the move is viewed asgroundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the Californiamarket, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it tooperate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely toconvert the branches to banks at that time.    In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billiondlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force inthe thrift market, against such large California thrifts asHome Federal, Great Western Financial Corp &lt;GWF>, H F Ahmansonand Co &lt;AHM>, Golden West  Financial &lt;GWD> and Great AmericanFirst Savings Bank &lt;GTA>.

"We have put together five or six years of prettyrespectable growth and three consecutive years of recordearnings and I see no reason why this growth pattern should beinterrupted," Scott's chairman and chief executive officerPhilip Lippincott told Reuters in an interview.    Last year, the company reported earnings of 4.96 dlrs ashare, reflecting the impact of a a strike at its Mobile,Alabama, plant.    Earlier today, Lippincott outlined his bullish growthscenario for analysts, emphasizing that the company is dealingwith the growing capacity in the industry by developing newproducts and modernizing plants. He said that capacityincreases in the industry, particularly tissue paper, havestymied price hikes but Scott has boosted sales by providingmore distinctive products that meet the needs of consumers.    "Scott Paper has shown tremendous growth in the last fiveyears, but I think that improvement is largely unappreciated bythe market," said analyst Sherman Chao of Salomon Brothers whonoted that the stock is selling at a relatively lowprice/earnings ratio.    "They have been striving for a return on equity of 14 to 17pct, but today they were talking about a much higher objective.They are raising their financial objectives," Chao said.    Sales of consumer products increased about four pct lastyear and showed growth of about five pct pace in the firstquarter, eclipsing the overall industry wide sales pace of lessthan two pct, Lippincott said.

The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of theagreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed upto last February. However, any delay this year should notendanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extendsthrough September, 1988, USDA officials said.
