Compaq's stock rose 1-3/8 to 32-1/4 onvolume of 1.3 mln shares.    "The rationale for the move," one trader said, "is that thedamage from the IBM announcement yesterday was less thanexpected."

"The first quarter was the strongest PC sales period onrecord for Compaq, Apple and IBM," Stahlman said, "and I don'tthink the IBM announcement is going to change that trend soon."

reut2-013.sgm, UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION ON TOKYO TRIP, The U.K. Government hopes for abreakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policiesduring next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs MinisterMichael Howard, political sources said.    Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he willtry to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from JapanesePrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help insolving the row over a U.K. Firm's bid to win a significantrole in Japan's telecommunications market, government sourcessaid.    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to armitself early with new statutory powers which it says could beused against certain Japanese financial institutions.    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter fromNakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as asignal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactoryoutcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>,government officials said.    But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyothat Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more thanpoliteness in the face of British anger, they added.    Howard said he would use his trip to push for a bigger rolein Japan's telecommunications industry for Cable and WirelessPlc. The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case forJapan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outsidecompetition.    Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection ofattempts by Britain to achieve that, Howard said "I am not sureit is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection ofMrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking apersonal interest in this problem.    "I don't understand it to be closed at all."    Howard added that during his Tokyo visit he would be"talking to them about it (the letter), finding out exactly whatthey do mean about it, and making it plain that we take a veryserious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is notas free as we allow access to our markets to be."    He noted that under the new Financial Services Act, Britaincould revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insuranceinstitutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to receive similartreatment in financial markets in Japan soon.    "I hope it won't come to that, and I don't think it will,"Howard added.    During the trip Howard will meet officials in the TokyoStock Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, the Trade Ministry,and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shunjiro Karasawa.    Karasawa is regarded as behind opposition to anysignificant role for Cable and Wireless in the Japanesetelecommunications industry.    Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were underminedagain today by fears of a possible U.K./Japanese trade war.This was despite denials by Trade and Industry Secretary PaulChannon that Britain was on the verge of a trade war.    He told a meeting of insurance brokers today that Britainbelieved a "sensible solution" could be found which would openJapanese markets to British goods.    Government officials were at pains today to deny thatBritain had set a deadline of three weeks for Japan to promisesimilar access to its financial markets to U.K.-based financialfirms as that enjoyed in London by equivalent Japanese firms.    They said that Department of Trade and Industry officialshad said yesterday that the measures against Japanese financialinstitutions could be imposed from then but that this did notnecessarily constitute a deadline.    Experts believe Britain would lose out by acting againstJapanese banks, insurance and investment institutions. Butdespite the danger of Japanese firms taking their tradeelsewhere in Europe, Howard said he did not expect the move tobackfire.    He said in a radio interview today  "it is true that webenefit from their presence - but they would not want to losethose advantages. And I am sure they are making their viewsplain to the Japanese government on this matter."    Howard, who will also be visiting South Korea beforereturning to London on April 11, said his trip to Tokyo wasplanned well before the current trade row.    Howard said his talks with Japanese officials would alsoinclude ways of jointly combating financial fraud in globalmarkets with Japanese officials. This would be done through acooperation between national regulatory bodies.    He said a memorandum of understanding for exchanginginformation to combat financial fraud would be sought withJapan on terms similar to one signed last autumn betweenBritain and the United States.

reut2-013.sgm, BRITAIN'S ECGD DISCUSSING NEW COVER FOR NIGERIA, Britain's Export Credits GuaranteeDepartment (ECGD) is holding talks with Nigeria aimed atresuming insurance cover for British exporters to Nigeria, thehead of ECGD's international debt division, Gerry Breach, said.    The ECGD suspended cover on Nigeria in 1984 after thecountry fell into arrears on payments of insured and uninsureddebts.    Following last week's bilateral accord between Britain andNigeria to reschedule the country's insured trade debts,bankers had hoped that talks would commence on a resumption ofcover.    Breach made his comments in an address to a private meetingof businessmen, a copy of which was made available to thepress.    Breach noted that for the ECGD to consider "a gradualintroduction of a package of new support" certain criteria wouldhave to be met.    This would involve the Nigerian economic structuraladjustment program being put into effect and being endorsed bythe International Monetary Fund, the program remaining oncourse and continuing to be endorsed by the IMF and asatisfactory level of acceptance by the Nigerian government ofthe ECGD insured short-term trade arrears.    Breach said that these criteria are now beginning to besatisfied, adding that while the ECGD could not yet formallyannounce new cover, it was holding discussions with Nigeria onpriorities for new credits.    He said an announcement would be made "as soon as possible"on an agreement and the ECGD would create a package for Nigeriathat would include the department's normal range of exporttrade support facilities.    British exports to Nigeria exceeded 550 mln stg in 1986.    Breach noted that since cover was removed, the ECGD hasmaintained a limited amount of short-term trade cover forNigeria, which was backed by letters of credit from theNigerian Central Bank.    While the ECGD would initially continue to use thisstructure under a new package, it would also hope to expand thevolume of coverage in the short-term area and relax the termsit is prepared to underwrite towards the commonly acceptedmaximum of 180 days.

Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from JapanesePrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help insolving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significantrole in Japan's telecommunications market, government sourcessaid.    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to armitself early with new statutory powers which it says could beused against certain Japanese financial institutions.    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter fromNakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as asignal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactoryoutcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc,government officials said.

reut2-013.sgm, CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD, World Bank President Barber Conableexpressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of anew showdown between the United States and Japan, might spreadthroughout the industrial world.    But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the actionby the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronicgoods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for afull-scale trade war.    Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developingcountries to open their markets, arguing that a free tradingenvironment increased the possibility of global economicgrowth.    "We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to manycountries in the developing world which have encouraged theopening of their markets and we want to be sure that thedeveloped world doesn't close at the same time," he said.    He said the U.S. action against Japan was "a significantretaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change intrade policy."    The interview came just before next week's semi-annualmeetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.    Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,Conable also said the global debt situation was very seriousand must be closely watched.    He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated onmaking loans that assist the basic underpinnings in thedeveloping world such as dams, roads and sewers, willincreasingly make assistance available for economic reform.    The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of thedebt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of newfunds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reformsaimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investmentand reducing government's role in the economy.    "We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,"Conable said.    He made clear, however, that adjustment lending wouldcontinue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lendingfor some time.    He noted, "the problem of debt was a severe one and manycountries are asking for adjustment assistance because of theproblem of debt."    Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New Yorkchosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. Heis an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launchedthe U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending bythe World Bank.    Conable also said that he expected the result of a majorstudy of the Bank's organization to be completed in the nextseveral weeks.    He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, inpart, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from thepoorest countries for not doing enough to help and from therichest countries because of inefficiency.    the reorganization is considered a major initiative byConable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151member-countries as an indication of his management style andpriorities.    "I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those whomust support it as soundly constituted so that it will bepermitted to grow," Conable said.    However, he said "I don't believe there is anythingbasically wrong with this institution and I don't believe ithas to have any redefinition of its purpose."    He said, however, that it was apparent that the debtinitiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central rolein dealing with the debt crisis.    Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and itssister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good andthat he talked often with IMF Managing Director MichelCamdessus on a variety of issues.    On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a needto put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that "I don't havea particular mission here except to be useful to theinstitution and to the process of development."    He added, "so I don't feel a great calling to personalizethe institution."    On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable saidthat the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assistingthe region, noting that half of the recently agreed financingof 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International DevelopmentAssociation was earmarked for Africa.    Leading industrial nations are expected to consider newforms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like thosein the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings. Reuter&#3;

The advisory alerts operators of the jumbo jets that aproblem has occurred and under what circumstances, but it doesnot recommend any action.

reut2-013.sgm, U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING, A steep drop in goods-producing jobsdetracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makesit unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetarypolicy to defend the dollar, economists said.    U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, lessthan the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial marketsexpected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared withFebruary's 50,000 gain, while March construction employmentdropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.    "The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as weend the first quarter," said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanleyand Co Inc. "This sets the stage for more sluggish growth inthe second and third quarters."    "The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,"he said. "They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, butclearly they can't tighten."    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downwardrevision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarterwere weaker than expected.    While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the Marchjobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quartergrowth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.    Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the averagemonthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.    "There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, but less than assumed," he said. "Gains in goods-producing jobswere subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fedtightening for exchange-related purposes."    In March, the average workweek fell back to its Januarylevel of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturinghours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.    The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturingjobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and electronic manufacturing.    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted fornearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.    Economists said that a build-up in auto inventoriesresulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up withthe labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.    Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as fivepct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales inthe first-quarter GNP accounts.    Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise twopct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in thesecond and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrialactivity "is a reasonable response in light of the inordinatecontribution inventory accumulation made to GNP."    Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gainsin industrial production and personal income for March.They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, forthese indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pctin industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.    Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the dropin March construction employment may also signal a drop inMarch housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units inJanuary.    The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest levelsince March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointedout that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.    "This just means that there were fewer people looking forwork, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much," he said.    He said the latest employment report will not concern theFed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of2.5-3.0 pct, but "it does suggest they can't afford to tightento quickly either."    The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonalfluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March laborforce gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated themin January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent withhis forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.    Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not thinkthat the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at theirmeeting this week. "At some point they will be more inclined toease," he said. For the time being, however, the Marchemployment report "increases the likelihood they won't tighten,regardless of the dollar." Reuter&#3;

Yesterday, Eli Lilly and Co joined the ranks of other drugcompanies by choosing to sell off its lower growth ElizabethArden cosmetics business.    "It's not that Elizabeth Arden is bad. To some it may betheir pride and joy, but to Eli Lilly, it's a diversion oftheir management energies and financial resources from theirgemstone, which is the drug business," Saks said.    "Arden is a good company. I'm sure it's going to be a hotproperty. I'm sure people will be lining up to buy it," saidLynne Hyman, E.F. Hutton cosmetics analyst.    Analysts said the Arden business could command about 600mln dlrs, and likely buyers would be interested in itswell-known name and distribution channels.

In an interpretation of current rules, which officials saidclarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tenderoffer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.    The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum sharecondition is a "material change" of the tender offer under U.S.securities law, SEC officials said.    The SEC has already said that other specific materialchanges, such as changes in the percentage of securities beingsought or the price being offered, made during the course of atender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.    The length of the extension, which is aimed at givingshareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tenderoffer, was not specified in cases where the minimum shareconditions were waived.    SEC officials said the length of the extension in suchcases would depend on the facts and circumstances surroundingeach case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.    The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waiversof a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of eachoffer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the newinformation. Officials declined to identify the two offers.    "If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end ofits offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequatedissemination," the SEC said.    Federal securities law requires that all tender offersremain open for at least 20 business days. Reuter&#3;
reut2-013.sgm, NEWS CORP'S &lt;NWS> FOX DEBUTS U.S. NETWORK, Fox Broadcasting, owned by RupertMurdoch's News Corp Ltd, is set to launch two prime timetelevision shows this Sunday on what some have called thefourth television network.    The company, built around Murdoch's two billion dlracquisition of seven television stations last year, marks thefirst network startup since 1948, when ABC, now owned byCapital Cities/ABC Inc &lt;CCB>, hit the airwaves.    "I think our goal, more than anything else, is to providean alternative to the three networks," said Fox president JamieKellner.    Fox's debut comes when earnings at two of the threenetworks are under pressure and network advertising dollarshave been growing slowly.    "The barriers to entry are exceptionally high," industryanalyst Peter Appert of C.J. Lawrence said. "Their (Fox) savinggrace is that their parent has deep pockets."    The question television industry, advertising and WallStreet executives are asking is whether this new entry can lureadvertisers from the big three: CBS Inc &lt;CBS>, ABC, and NBC, aunit of General Electric Co &lt;GE>.    Network advertising revenues rose to 8.6 billion dlrs in1986 from 8.3 billion a year earlier, with NBC accounting forall of the gain. Revenues at CBS and ABC declined, analystsnoted.    "They (Fox) are competing for the same pool of funds as thetraditional networks," said Jon Mandel, associate mediadirector at Grey Advertising Inc.    But James Mandelbaum, a Los Angeles-based entertainmentattorney said, "If they have enough money, they have a goodchance of making it work."    Fox president Jamie Kellner said the company expects tolose 30 to 50 mln dlrs this year on revenues of about 150 mlndlrs. He said it will take three to five years to turn aprofit.    To succeed, the company must also win over the youngviewership it has targeted with an offbeat set of shows, two ofwhich debut this Sunday, and another, next weekend.    The first Fox-produced program -- "The Late Show,"featuring comedienne Joan Rivers -- was shown last fall onFox's seven stations and close to 100 affiliates. Although theshow has dropped recently in ratings, it still has a captiveyoung audience in the late night time slot, analysts said.    Sunday's prime-time shows include a situation comedy,"Married ... with Children," which Kellner describes as analternative to the suger coated family shows on the networks.It is also airing "The Tracy Ullman Show," featuring theBritish comedienne, singer and actress.    Fox has lined up 107 independent TV stations around theU.S. to run the shows. The networks have some 637 affiatedstations.    To make sure viewers get a chance to see the programs, thecompany is taking the unprecedented step of airing them threetimes in the course of the evening.    "I believe if some of their shows were on the traditionalnetworks, it would be extremely high-rated," Mandel said, whoadded that his firm has signed up several million dlrs inadvertising for the shows.    But some question whether Fox will really become a fourthnetwork. Robert Adler, president of the CabletelevisionAdvertising Bureau, said many cable shows are geared to theaudience Fox is attempting to win. "There are already manyalternatives out there to the three networks," he said.    And at least one network is not yet ready to consider Foxthe competition. An ABC spokesman said, "the schedule we've puttogether for this Sunday night ... has not taken Fox'sprogramming schedule into account."    But analysts noted that the major networks are keeping aeye on the venture to see how it fares in the ratings and withits advertisers.    Fox also appears willing to take a long-term view. Askedwhether the company will be looking at ratings after Sunday'sdebut, Kellner said, "the last thing I want to do is worryabout ratings because that was the last thing Murdoch told meto do."

reut2-013.sgm, U.S. SCIENTISTS SAY TROPICAL OILS HEALTH RISK, U.S. scientists said some tropicalvegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is atrisk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight toa campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) forlabelling changes.    The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied byMalaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palmkernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raiseblood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.    In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel andcoconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on foodmanufacturers' labels.    The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it wouldconsider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealingwith cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods.    Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASAthat palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol andcontributes to heart disease are untrue.    But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at RutgersUniversity, said, "Palm oil is definitely not good for humanhealth because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid."    He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater theblood cholesterol level. "It has been well established thathigh cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heartdisease," he said.    A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, BorgeBek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil ischolesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancerproperties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteriesin humans.    Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fatsdaily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than frompalm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E.    David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the WistarInstitute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view onlabelling. "What people really have to learn is to read labels,"said Kritchevsky. "The more a consumer knows, the more likely hewill make an intelligent choice."    The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm,palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels.    Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, "Moresaturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from thatpoint of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels inthe blood are a risk factor for heart disease."    Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S.Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division,said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils withhigh saturated fat levels was highest among those who haveheart disease.    The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acidcontent of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.    David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, saidU.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumerswere aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.    Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S.soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates.    U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mlnlbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a yearearlier, according to Commerce Department figures.    Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier. Reuter&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS, Firmer crude oil prices, government aidpackages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oilindustry recover from last year sharp downturn, industryanalysts said.    They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices droppedabout 50 pct.    On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared totheir highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading atrecord highs.    "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on thepart of the investment community that the outlook for theindustry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and CoLtd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.    Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of lastyear's results, analysts said.    "But the financial statements are a snap shot and arecording of history. The stock market is the indication of thefuture," Gobert commented.    The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15at the end of 1986.    Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares ofImperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, istrading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.    Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, isat 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.    Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecastsoperating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gascompanies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrsand operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billiondlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs abarrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increasewith cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said.    "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of theprofit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,"he added.    Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, whenoperating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90billion dlrs.    But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will holdrecent gains and more government assistance is needed.    Canadian Petroleum Association technical director HansMaciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crudeoil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPECproduction accord will continue to support prices.    However, several companies share the optimistic industryoutlook expressed by a majority of analysts.    Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecastimproved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued thisweek, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.    "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but notrobust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report.    "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there isgood reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added.    In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies havepared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,deferring most frontier exploration work.    "The industry is becoming very selective in investments,very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,"Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.    Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushionthe industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.    The most significant help came last September when thefederal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.    Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oilcompanies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.    The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flowdecline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented furtherexploration spending cuts, analysts said.    "For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutelynecessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments thatwere made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerablymore," Maciej said.

reut2-013.sgm, LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS, STRONG EXPORTS - USDA, Rising demand for U.S. rice maygradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should helpincrease the U.S. share of the world rice market despitesluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.    In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, thedepartment said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mlnhundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt onJuly 31.    Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage isexpected to decline this year, the report said.    USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grainacreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grainrelative to long grain have increased, the loan differentialhas been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yieldsrelative to those of other classes have leveled off.    With the drop in domestic prices resulting from themarketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at afaster rate, USDA said.    "Development of new products and increased promotion havehelped make rice more available and visible to a wider range ofconsumers," USDA said.    USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 becauseof large production and stocks but a weaker market shouldaffect competing exporters more than the U.S.    "The United States has already recovered a substantial shareof the European Community market and made inroads into marketsin the Middle East and Africa," the report said.    World rice consumption is projected to reach record levelsin 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,increased domestic production and low import prices haveallowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarsegrains.    China, India and South Korea have increased output, whilethe Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since themid-1970s, the report said. Reuter&#3;

The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allowmechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels asthe species from which it was derived.    For example, "pork" would be listed on the ingredientsstatement instead of "mechanically separated pork."    Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat productwould have to be stated on the label and the mechanicallyseparated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meatand poultry portion of the product.    Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-costproduct that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.    Current regulations allow use of mechanically separatedingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultryproduct, but require it to be listed in the ingredientstatement as "mechanically separated (species)," USDA said.    USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoidusing mechanically separated meat in their products because theterm carries an "unwarranted negative connotation" in the mindsof many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similarregulation exists for poultry products.    Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcassparts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have someremaining meat, into specialized processing equipment. Reuter&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, FEBRUARY FOMC MAINTAINED FOUR TO EIGHT PCT  FEDERAL FUNDS RATE REFERENCE RANGE, 
reut2-013.sgm, FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY, The Federal Open Market Committee atits February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain thethen-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed.    The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policydirective which gave greater possibility to firmer rather thaneasier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct Januarythrough March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and noM-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set aseven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.    The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal fundsrate "reference" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.    At a telephone conference on February 23, committee membersdiscussed the possible implications of the decisions reached inParis for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. Noconclusions were contained in the minutes.    In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMCsaid that "somewhat greater reserve restraint would, orslightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptabledepending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking intoaccount the strength of the business expansion, developments inforeign exchange markets, progress against inflation, andconditions in domestic and international credit markets."    The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchangedpolicy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank presidentfavored some tightening of reserve conditions.    He noted the strong growth in bank loans in Novemberthrough January and the firm federal funds rate that hadprevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. Healso cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.    Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potentialfor a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believedthat prompt restraints might avert the need for moresubstantial tightening later.    Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMCminutes showed, "the members generally felt that policyimplementation should be especially alert to the potential needfor some firming of reserve conditions."    In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserverestraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow inline with current expectations and there were concurrentindications of intensifying inflationary pressures against thebackground of stronger economic data.    One indication of potential price pressure might be afurther tendency for the dollar to weaken.    The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easingduring the weeks ahead. However, "most of the members did notwant to rule out the possibility of some slight easing duringthe inter-meeting period, although they did not view theconditions for such a move as likely to emerge."    The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in thedollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have anysignificant effect on the Fed's economic projections. Inaddition, they anticipated that considerable progress would bemade in reducing the federal budget deficit. Reuter&#3;

S and P said that after two years and many delays anddisappointments, the cable television industry has firmlyestablished a net cash generating position.    However, rather than using their improved position todecrease the leverage of current capital structures, thecompanies' cash flows are being fully leveraged to finance awave of consolidations, S and P said.    Many cable television companies exhibit greater financialrisk because of their asset growth aspirations anddebt-financed consolidation. That delays a lower risk profilefor many of them, Standard and Poor's said.    The acquisition and financial growth policies of manycompany executives heavily influenced the ratings outlook.    Citing aggressive capital structures, acquisitions and cashflow coverages of interest expense of between 1.0 and 1.5times, S and P noted that the companies are more debt intensivenow than in their building phase.

reut2-013.sgm, U.S. TREASURY MARKET ENDS SHARPLY HIGHER, The U.S. Treasury market ended sharplyhigher, reassured by news that the Federal Open MarketCommittee voted in February to maintain the then-existingdegree of restraint on bank reserves, dealers said.    News of a weaker-than-expected March employment report anda minor bounce back in the dollar prompted short-covering thatpushed coupon issues higher, while an easing in the Federalfunds rate below six pct helped short-dated issues.    The key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price finished 3/4higher at 95-27/32, pushing the yield down to 7.86 pct from7.93 pct yesterday.    Danuta Zielonka of Wertheim Schroder Co Inc said thatrecent slowing in the growth of the monetary aggregates is aanother factor arguing against firmer Fed policy.    "Money growth has been slowing perceptibly in March whichshould give them more room to not tighten," she said. "Both M2and M3 are will be at the low end of their target ranges inMarch."    "The FOMC minutes are neutral for the bond market,"Zielonka said. "Dollar considerations will prevent them fromeasing anytime soon, but they can't tighten with the economyweak and the banks having to deal with Brazil."    Doubts on the economy's strength were underscored not onlyby a smaller-than-expected 164,000 gain in March non-farmpayrolls, but also by a downward revision in February's gain to236,000 from a previously reported 337,000.    The market's initial reaction to the data was restrained byfears the employment news would undermine the dollar, but whenthe dollar maintained a firm tone, the bond market extended itsgains.    Profit-taking pulled bond prices down from the day's highs,but a record close in the U.S. stock market stimulated buyinglate in the day that offset this somewhat.    Still, coupon issues were unable to recover completely fromthis week's steep losses as trade tensions between the U.S. andJapan pressured the dollar and discouraged Japanese investorsfrom buying U.S. Treasury bonds.    The current 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond traded down to 94-11/32in Tokyo this week, pushing the yield to 7.98 pct. This cappedthe U.S. 1987 high yield on the 30-year bond of 7.93 pct, seenyesterday.    Treasury bills advanced on the week. The six-month billsrose one basis point, but three-month bills fell 17 basispoints and the year bill fell two basis points.    Dealers said that the sharp drop in three-month billsresulted in part from recent outright bill purchases for acustomer, believed to be related to heavy intervention byforeign central banks to support the dollar.    A drop in the Fed funds rate to 5-15/16 today underpinned adecline in bill rates. It traded at this level throughout thesession, down from yesterday's 6.14 pct average.    Three-month bills closed two basis points lower at 5.48 pctbid. Six- and 12-month bills both dropped nine basis points torespective bids of 5.70 pct and 5.75 pct. Reuter&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, U.S. CAR SALES RECOVER FROM JANUARY BLAHS, Sales of U.S.-built new cars surgedduring the last 10 days of March to the second highest levelsof 1987, indicating that car buying may have fully reboundedfrom its January slump.    Sales of imports, meanwhile, fell for the first time inyears, succumbing to price hikes by foreign carmakers.    For the ten-day March 21-31 period, domestic automakerssold 282,358 new cars, up 19.3 pct from late March 1986, givingthe industry an annualized sales rate of 8.1 mln cars. Thatrate a year ago was 6.9 mln cars.    "The last 10 days of March was the second strongest 10-dayperiod we've had this year," said David Healy at Drexel BurnhamLambert.    "We've had a slow recovery since January, and these latestfigures build on that. This lends some encouragement to theidea that we're looking at a pretty strong year," he said.    In early February sales were up briefly to 8.3 mln units onan annual basis, before dropping again.    Car buyers had rushed to dealer showrooms in December totake advantage of expiring tax deductions, taking away fromnormal January selling.    But a slowly expanding economy, an exploding stock marketand a growing array of incentives have lured customers todealers' showrooms, analysts said.   Ford Motor Co &lt;F> sales jumped 29.5 pct in the period to79,249 cars from 61,169 a year ago. For the month, the nation'ssecond largest carmaker said sales increased 17.8 pct to197,328 compared to 167,490.    Chrysler Corp &lt;C> reported a 20.2 pct sales jump to 40,454compared with 33,669. In all of March it sold 96,649, up 6.3pct from 90,945.    Industry giant General Motors's sales rose a more modest6.2 pct for late March to 140,522 verses 132,298 last year. Butsales for the full month dropped 5.6 pct to 349,578 from370,390.    Also helping the U.S.-based industry, analysts said, is theslackening demand for imports, which suffered the first salesdecline in memory.    "Imports will need more and more sales incentives, aphenomenon unheard of two years ago," said Scott Merlis atMorgan Stanley. "Import prices have risen 17 pct on average, sothey've become more sensitive to weaker demand in general."    General Motors market share for the period fell to 48.2pct, below the 51 pct for the first three months of the yearand far below the 56 pct of most of last year.    Ford's market share was 28.1 pct, up from 27.7 pct for thefirst three months, while Chrysler's share was 14.3 pct, a risefrom 13.7 pct since the start of the year.    Falling market share at General Motors apparently promptedthe company to decide this week to close six plants for a weekto bring supply into line with demand.    But Ronald Glantz at Montgomery Securities said furtherproduction cuts might be necessary.    "While GM has just taken 100,00 units out of second quarterproduction already because of weak sales, the continuation ofthis weakening market share suggests another production cutbackis likely," Glantz said.    Other carmakers with U.S plants posted these results duringthe March 21 to 31 period -- American Motors Corp &lt;AMC> 1,198,down 50 pct, Volkswagen 2,145, down from 3,342, American Honda16,635, up from 6,358, and Nissan 4,635, up from 2,536.

In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-Kfiling, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified theutility last month that no additional credit would be granted.Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to beginmaking prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more thanthe estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.    "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the companymay have to seek protection from its creditors under thebankruptcy code," Gulf States said.    The utility had previously said it might be forced toconsider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rateincreases granted by state regulators in connection with GulfStates' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.    "If the regulatory commissions approve the company'sproposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases providedfor in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period,the company believes it could achieve financial stability,"Gulf States said.

An independent finance company on the other hand mustoperate within more stringent guidelines than a unit and is ata competitive disadvantage, S and P said.

Standard and Poor's said that some finance subsidiarieshave formal support agreements with the parent company whichobligate the parent to maintain the unit's net worth.  Theagreement assures that the unit meets its obligations on timeand requires it to operate within specific guidelines.

reut2-013.sgm, PERU SAYS IT INTENDS TO DEEPEN DEBT STANCE, President Alan Garcia said he sought todeepen Peru's hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly bylimiting repayments to the World Bank.    In a televised address tonight, he criticised the WorldBank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amountthe bank is willing to make in new loans. "We will deepen ourpolicy on the foreign debt," he said.    Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct ofexport earnings, effectively suspending most remittances dueforeign private banks and many governments. It has generallybeen current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office onpayments to the World Bank and the Inter-American DevelopmentBank.    But tonight Garcia said: "We have met our aim of limitingthe payment of the debt and will limit it also even thoughorganisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige usto buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain typesof public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollarsthan that which they are willing to newly lend us."    The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bankabout 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlrdebt.    Garcia said his government had been a model for LatinAmerica because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domesticproduct (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard lineon debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year.    He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wageto 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wageworkers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln.    Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servantsand 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage butnot covered by collective bargaining agreements.    He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1,1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis perU.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of theyear. He did not say when this increase would be effective.    Taxes on petrol are the government's leading revenueearner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes.Sales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up,he said, without specifying the amount.    Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruviansto repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pctpremium above the market exchange rate.

The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buyAbu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs abarrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72dlrs.    The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAEproducer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months.    Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd fromaround 370,000 in February after the emirate declared amid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, thesources added.    Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaifand Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixedprices too high and cut liftings, the sources said.    The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japaneseterm buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, theyadded. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of itMurban.    Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came onstream in 1983, to be test production not included incalculations for complying with the OPEC quota.

He told a news conference he had planned to sit down with aconsultative group of major donors led by the World Bank latethis month in Tokyo but said the documentation of the projectwould not be ready until the end of this month.    "The World Bank has recommended that we meet some time inthe second half of May because it is pointless to have thatmeeting unless the participants have had adequate time toreview the documentation," he said.    Government officials said the progam, estimated to cost 36billion pesos, aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land,including some 50,000 hectares seized from former associates ofdeposed President Ferdinand Marcos.    The new plan will include not only rice and corn land butalso sugar and coconut plantations. It is expected to benefitabout three mln impoverished peasants.    Ongpin said earlier there was strong interest in theprogram from donors but said given the substantial financialrequirements of the plan, the government could not rely on onlyone source but on a combination of sources.    President Corazon Aquino approved last month the use of anestimated 20 billion pesos from the proceeds of the sale ofcertain non-performing assets to private companies.    Ongpin said he has asked Aquino to consider two othersources, namely the proceeds from the sale of governmentcorporations which are to be privatised and proceeds from theliquidation of seized Marcos-related assets.    He also said he would recommend public hearings before sucha big project was legislated.    "If we get a good reception in the public hearings, perhapsthen the President might feel persuaded that it is notnecessary to wait for the Congress," he said.

But he added that arguments against joining had weakened.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be thestrongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has madeclear she does not expect to consider joining until after thenext UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest.    But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters afteran informal European Community finance ministers' meeting herethat other factors apart from the upcoming election stood inthe way of full membership.    In addition to the question of the exchange rates at whichBritain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism,there was also the impact of sterling membership on the systemto be considered, he said.    British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar systembased on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterlingsystem, he noted. "We have to make sure it would work."    But Lawson added that some of the considerations that hadmade it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posedless of a problem.    As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency,which he said was diminishing. "That argument has clearlyweakened," he said.

reut2-013.sgm, EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS, European Community (EC)finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need forgreater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System(EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said.    "There was a general will to reinforce the European MonetarySystem, with all that implies," Belgian Finance Minister MarkEyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session ofinformal talks at this Belgian coastal resort.    The gathering was the first such discussion since thesecond major realignment of EMS parities within nine months inJanuary.    The system has come under severe strain as funds haveflowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMScurrency, the West German mark, sending it soaring againstweaker currencies in the system.    But Eyskens said February's agreement between leadingwestern industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates ataround current levels was working and this would allow the ECto speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of theEMS.    He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on theneed for closer coordination among EMS member governments ofinterest rate policies and of interest rate differentialsbetween different countries.    They also agreed they needed better coordination ofexchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, bothwhen they reached their fixed EMS limits and within theiragreed margins.    But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range oftechnical problems and ministers would discuss these further inLuxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC'sMonetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.    He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economicconvergence betwen Community countries and it was importantthat interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchangerates and inflation rates.    The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds thepresidency of the community, made clear the meeting had notproduced any agreement to move radically forward in developingthe EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic andmonetary integration.    "We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normalfunctioning of the system," Eyskens said.    Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMShas to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise allmovements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to goahead.    EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told themeeting the authority would put forward proposals for a finalphase of capital market liberalisation in October that wouldinclude safeguard clauses for member countries for which themove would create difficulties.    Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers alsodiscussed the need to "dedramatise" realignments of EMS paritiesby letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out bytelephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.    However, West German sources said Bonn Finance MinisterGerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson toldjournalists that one of the technical issues raised by greatercoordination of exchange market intervention was the questionof which currencies should be used to intervene and held incentral bank reserves.    He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS wouldwork better if central banks held each other's currencies -- anissue of particular importance regarding West Germany since theBundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.    He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignmentsreflected a general feeling among participants that the way theJanuary reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.   The realignment was marked by acrimony between France andWest Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains inthe system that forced the parity overhaul. REUTER&#3;

The Defence Department also denied any military supplieshad been sent to Iran since an administration ban late lastyear.    NBC television, quoting U.S. And foreign intelligencesources, reported that the United States had been shippingweapons-related equipment to Iran as recently as last month.    The administration official, who asked not to be named,told Reuters there had been commercial sales of productslicensed by the Commerce Department, which maintains a list ofproducts that can be exported without hurting nationalsecurity.    President Reagan banned arms shipments to Tehran after theIran arms scandal broke last November.    In January Secretary of State George Shultz told the SenateForeign Relations Committee there would be "no more transfers ofU.S.-origin military equipment to Iran, either directly orthrough third parties."    The NBC report said the Pentagon was coordinating shipmentsof anti-aircraft command and control equipment used to directfire of weapons systems.    It said some shipments labelled "machine parts" had movedthrough Ostend, Belgium,on aircraft of the Santa Lucia Airways,which it identified as operated by the U.S. CentralIntelligence Agency (CIA).

reut2-013.sgm, JAL PLANE CRASH THOUGHT DUE TO BOEING &lt;BA.N> FAULT, A Japanese government investigation teambelieves that faulty repairs by Boeing Co caused the worstsingle plane crash in history, one of the team said.    Boeing Co is the manufacturer of the Japan Air Lines 747jumbo jet which crashed into a mountain in Japan on August 12,1985, killing 520 people. There were only four survivors.    A Boeing spokesman, contacted by telephone at the firm'sheadquarters in Seattle, Washington, told Reuters the firmwould probably have no comment to make until the Japaneseinvestigation team's report was officially released.    The team investigator, a Japanese Transport Ministryofficial who declined to be identified, said a failure byJapanese aircraft inspectors to check the repair work done onthe plane by a Boeing team had provoked an internal debate inthe Ministry over inspection procedures.    The Ministry official told Reuters that a report by histeam, which has already been sent in draft form to the U.S.National Transportation Safety Board for comment, should bereleased in late May. Under an international convention, thedraft must be submitted for final comments to the pertinentauthorities.    Asked on Thursday about Boeing's role in the crash, aMinistry spokesman declined comment.    On September 6, 1985, Boeing issued an official statementsaying that repairs it had undertaken on the doomed Japan AirLines plane in 1978 were faulty.    However, no official, direct connection was then madebetween the faulty repairs and the crash.    The Japanese investigation team says in its draft reportthat it believes those faulty repairs were the cause of the1985 accident, the investigator said.    The Boeing statement after the crash said: "Examination ofthe wreckage, the flight data recorder readout, the cockpitvoice recorder, and interviews with the surviving off-dutyflight attendant indicate that decompression occurred in flightdue to a rupture of the aft pressure bulkhead.    "The Boeing examination of the bulkhead at the site of thecrash has revealed that a relatively small section of thebulkhead splice, approximately 17 per cent, was not correctlyassembled during repairs which Boeing made after a 1978 landingaccident," the statement said.    The repairs were required after a 1978 landing accident atOsaka airport, in western Japan, in which the plane's tailscraped the runway.    The Japanese report also mentions the government inspectorswho in 1978 signed a certificate of airworthiness approving therepairs, he said.    Police had investigated four inspectors, including one manwho two weeks ago killed himself by drinking insecticide afterfour days of police questioning.    "None of the four had looked at Boeing's repair work," theinvestigator said. REUTER&#3;

The Bouygues-led consortium was widely regarded as the lesslikely of the two candidates in contention to be awarded thethree billion franc stake by the National Commission forCommunications and Liberties (NCCL), the French televisionwatchdog authority.

He told journalists the accord, reached in the so-calledParis Club of western governments, calls for rescheduling thedebts of sub-Saharan African countries over very long periodsand on very favourable terms.    The proposals will be put forward for discussion at ameeting of the International Monetary Fund/World BankDevelopment Committee in Washington next week, he said.    Lawson said that under the proposals countries could have15 or 20 years to repay their debts along with have a graceperiod.    But he added the favourable terms would not be offeredindiscriminately to all nations in the region but granted on acase-by-case basis.    The Paris Club groups Western governments -- as opposed tocommercial banks -- which are owed money by poorer nations.    Lawson was speaking after an informal gathering of EuropeanCommunity finance ministers and central bankers held to preparefor discussions on international monetary issues and ThirdWorld debt at next week's spring meetings of the IMF and WorldBank.    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he hadinsisted at the gathering that developed countries takeadequate account of the problems facing poorer nations thatwere trying to put their ailing economies in order.    He told journalists he would be unveiling new proposals fordealing with the Third World debt problem in  Washington.    He declined to give details but Belgian Finance MinisterMark Eyskens, who hosted the talks, indicated that Balladur'sproposals involved giving a greater role to a World Bank fundused to compensate developing countries for falls in the pricesof their main commodities.    "The French ideas got a very sympathetic welcome," Eyskenstold a news conference.    He said the European Community felt a new IMF(International Monetary Fund) report which forecastsinflation-adjusted economic growth of just 2.5 pct in theindustrialised world this year, compared with 3.1 pct expectedlast autumn, was slightly too pessimistic.    Many economists believe industrialised countries need togrow by at least three pct a year if the world debt is to bebrought under control.    Eyskens added the Community wanted to give "certain nuances"to the IMF report that would be constructive for dealing withthe Third World debt problem.

He said the response was expected by next month, butreiterated his belief that Britain would not have to invoke anew law allowing a ban on Japan's banks and insurance firmsfrom trading in London if it failed to reciprocate in Tokyo.    "I don't think that talk of a trade war is justified in anyevent ... I think the Japanese are going to realize that it'simportant that access should be available."    The Conservative British government decided on Thursday tobring forward legislation allowing the possible imposition of aban against foreign countries failing to allow reciprocalmarket access. It is due to take effect in three weeks.    Twenty-nine Japanese banks, nine insurance companies and 58securities houses currently operate in London, while only fiveBritish banks and eight securities firms are licensed in Japan.    "We are sure reasonable men will come to a reasonablesolution," said a spokesman for &lt;Nomura International>, thebiggest of the Japanese securities firms in London which couldbe targetted.    The government decided to rush provisions of the FinancialServices Act into effect largely in response to the failure ofCable and Wireless &lt;CAWL.L> to gain what it considers asatisfactory stake in one of two consortia seeking to competein Japan's international telephone business.

reut2-013.sgm, IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND, Growth in oil consumption in the Westernindustrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pctthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the InternationalEnergy Agency (IEA) said.    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by aroundone pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said inits Monthly Oil Market Report.    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices arehigher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may bebelow last year's 3.6 pct, it said.    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product pricesstay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users canbe expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain someof the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and theremay be slightly less growth in transport fuels.    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.    The agency said this flat trend is explained by theprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter ofthe year which offset a reduction in stocks.    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fellby 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of theyear. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd buta decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reportedstocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonneson April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments builtup strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in theperiod.    The year-on-year trend of government stock building iscontinuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, moreor less in line with consumption, after declining for fiveyears, the IEA noted.    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,respectively.    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to94 days of consumption.    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mlnbpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports fromcentrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the firstquarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpdof crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln averagefor the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was thelargest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEAsaid.    Saudi Arabia"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd. REUTER&#3;

The poll was the first major test of public opinion sincenational elections last January returned Chancellor HelmutKohl's CDU-dominated coalition to power in Bonn.    Political commentators said the result was a debacle forthe SPD, which has been split by disagreements over the party'sfuture direction.

reut2-013.sgm, MARCH U.S. PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX UP AT 53.9, The U.S. economy in March improved at afaster rate than in February, with the National Association ofPurchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from51.9 pct, the NAPM said.    The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct.The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for therest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross nationalproduct growth of about three pct.    An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that theeconomy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies adeclining economy.    The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in allof the indicators in the index except inventories, whichdeclined slightly.    New orders rose sharply in March, with production alsohigher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economyimproved in March. Employment expanded for the first time sinceAugust 1984.    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business surveycommittee and director of materials management at Pitney BowesInc &lt;PBI> said "the economy ended the first quarter with ahealthy, if not substantial improvement."    Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders inMarch assures a good beginning for the second quarter.    Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that theywere paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Ofthose paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at2.5 pct.    The estimated average price increase anticipated by membersfor the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue torise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them asbeing significant.    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, basedon five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.    The monthly report is based on questions asked ofpurchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies. Reuter&#3;

A poll in today's Daily Express showed 39 pct support forthe ruling Conservative party, 30 pct for the Alliance ofLiberals and Social Democrats and 29 pct for the Labour party.    Reproduced in a general election, the result would giveThatcher an overall parliamentary majority of 22.    A poll in yesterday's Sunday Times gave the Conservatives41 pct support, 12 percentage points ahead of both oppositiongroups -- their biggest lead in three-and-a-half years.    Conservative sources have said Thatcher would prefer aseries of polls giving her party over 40 pct of the vote,securing it a clear parliamentary majority, before announcingthe date for the next election.    Lord Whitelaw, Conservative leader in the House of Lordsand one of Thatcher's closest advisors, yesterday ruled out aMay general election, but left open the choices of June andearly autumn.    The Sunday Times poll, taken during Thatcher's visit toMoscow last week, was the first to show the party breakingthrough 40 pct.    The Express poll was the first since Thatcher's trip toMoscow, hailed as a triumph by the British media. It confirmeda number of recent surveys suggesting that the Alliance hadovertaken Labour.

reut2-013.sgm, U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING, U.S. Bond trading is likely to remaincautious in the near term with a possible downward price biasas market participants focus on trends in the dollar, theeconomy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.    Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains,that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed willkeep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.    Until trends are clearer, "the market can only attempt to toestablish and hold a new trading range at higher interestrates," said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthysaid that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthyinvestment climate, the market will have no confidence in thisenvironment until there is illumination of and confidence inU.S. Dollar/trade policy.    Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market,highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged ifcurrency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseaseconomic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.    "The crucial question, however, is how soon either of thesedevelopments is likely to occur," Kaufman said.    "Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio managerconfidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a whilelonger," said Philip Braverman, chief economist at IrvingSecurities Corp.    However, Braverman said that, "from a longer termperspective, current (bond) prices provide a buyingopportunity."    Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday onunexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasurybonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole andThursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.    Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a longbond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism.Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.    The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in asimilar "paroxysm of pessimism," the key bonds reached a similarclosing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance,however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring theyield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.    Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc saidthat many portfolio managers now believe yields could approachnine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.    Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts havespoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher andthey continue to believe that an upward bias is likely topersist over the next few months.    Held said that in conversations with portfolio managerslast week there appeared to be increasing belief that the raterise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct bymidyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.    "Yields could rise further over the next few months, but therise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seensince the start of the year," Held said.    Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.    "The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance," saideconomists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.    They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push upinterest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollarand head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harmthe fragile U.S. Economic expansion.    The Lanston economists said, "The Fed cannot ease its policystance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calmdomestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat ofcausing a further decline in the dollar."    Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policyunchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policylater if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or creditmarkets warranted a policy shift.    However, economists generally believe that continued fairlysluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.Banks resulting from their problem loans to developingcountries rule out any Fed policy firming.    There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC atlast Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.    This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have littleimpact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due onWednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.    There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S.Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economicindicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. AFriday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's firstquarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNPgrowth of about three pct if continued through 1987.    Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and areexpected to open about there today with no Fed action seen. REUTER&#3;

Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximatelyone billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividendand the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mlndlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, hastold the company it is confident it can arrange the entirefinancing needed for the recapitalization.    Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of thehotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement theboard believes the recapitalization plan is financiallysuperior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.    Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommendsthat shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.    The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.    "Our ability to restructure along these lines is possibleprimarily because of the financial stability and the strongoperating results achieved by management in recent years," Glucksaid.    He said that after the recapitalization takes effect,proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 isexpected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.    Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalizationcommon and common-equivalent shares outstanding.    Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook,Gluck said "we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrsin 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lowerinterest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debtincurred in connection with the recapitalization."    He said the company does not usually release projections,but has done so now beause of the significance of therecapitalization.    Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted forstockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.    The plan will require the approval of stockholders and thatof the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.    As part of the plan, the company will change its state ofincorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger ofCaesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.    The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will providefor, among other things, a "fair price" provision requiring thatcertain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders beapproved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding sharesheld by such interested stockholders.    Caesars World said in a statement that "the cashdistribution will result in a substantial deficit instockholders' equity." It did not give an estimate of the sizeof this deficit.    But the company said its financial advisors have said theybelieve that after the recapitalization, Caesars World shouldhave the financial flexibility and resources necessary tofinance its current and projected operating and capitalrequirements.

Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by aroundone pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day,the IEA said in its latest monthly report.    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if averageconsumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth forthese fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.

If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some ofthe market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.    IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECDarea at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. Thisis about the same as at the begining of the year.

Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were putat 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January oneand equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, downfrom the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to94 days of consumption.

And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said.    As crude production also fell, there is likely to have alsobeen a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, theIEA said.    World oil supply fell through the first quarter by abouttwo bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpdin January and to the seasonal drop in exports from CentrallyPlanned Economies, the IEA said.    Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the firstquarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three monthsof 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd asagainst 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largestfactor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF FAMINE IN BANGLADESH, The failure of the Bangladesh governmentto tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to afamine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, KhaledaZia, told a press conference yesterday.    Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the countryin March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheatsales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said.    Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-Aprilwill ease the situation. "Temporary grain shortage in the aridnorth and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual atthis time of the year," one official said.    Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials andfailure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Herremarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heatwave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in thesouth-west.    Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000tonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two orthree weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes ofrice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30. Itrevised its food import target for this fiscal year upward by300,000 tonnes to 1.8 mln.

reut2-013.sgm, U.S. TO PRESS FOR FASTER JAPANESE, GERMAN GROWTH, The U.S. Administration, underCongressional pressure to cut the trade deficit, will urgeTokyo and Bonn to meet commitments to speed economic growth tostabilise currencies at Wednesday's meetings of leadingindustrial nations in Washington, monetary sources said.    The U.S. Will also try to develop proposals made at the1986 Tokyo Summit for measures to ensure agreements such as theParis Accord are more binding, they said.    Treasury Secretary James Baker's dual initiatives reflectU.S. Frustration with the two countries for not moving fastenough to curb their huge trade surpluses, they added.    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected tobring the outline of an economic stimulus package to themeeting, which will be attended by West Germany, France,Britain, Italy and Canada as well as the U.S. And Japan, thesources said.    "The sooner the Japanese can announce their intention toannounce a stimulative package,the better it is for Japan andfor the exchange markets in general," one of the sources said.    Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Paris Agreement, inwhich West Germany and Japan made their commitments, will berenewed by the industrial countries this week.    Other U.S. Officials said a meeting of the Group of Sevenwill be a status report on progress Bonn and Tokyo have madesetting up stimulus measures.    The U.S. Will tell its partners that it expects a furthersubstantial budget deficit reduction package to be agreed withCongress this year, the sources said.    Washington would like its economic partners to establishspecific economic policy goals. Sharp deviations from the setobjectives would trigger consultations among the countries onappropriate corrective action, they added.    The Paris accord envisaged surplus countries like Japan andWest Germany stimulating domestic demand to absorb more importsand the U.S. Cutting its budget deficit, thereby depressing itsdemand for imports.    But the markets are signalling the dollar's floor may befar below its level at the time the Paris agreement was struck,the sources said.    Monetary sources also said the dollar's recent sharp fallagainst the yen reflected the U.S.-Japanese dispute oversemi-conductor trade which resulted in U.S. Tariffs on certainJapanese electronic goods.

It was the second production sharing contract signed byPertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986.    The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presenceof Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oilproduction split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour.    Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mlndlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first twoyears.    The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oilproducing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials saidthere is a good chance of getting a high return on investment.    A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilledbefore, was neglected because it is deeper than surroundingblocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have nowmade seismic survey possible.    The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contractPertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February.    Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina'sfavour with operational costs deducted.    Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil'sproduction share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interestin the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it findsoil.

reut2-013.sgm, OIL PRICES SEEN HOLDING STEADY IN SECOND QUARTER, Japanese oil traders generally expect oilprices to remain steady through June, when the nextOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meetingis scheduled to take place.    Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than amonth, despite coming under considerable pressure in Februaryas Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks stronglyresist paying official prices, trade sources said.    Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily tostabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target, they said.    Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month,mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and memberswould submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said.    However, Opec's discipline in holding its price and outputtargets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said.    Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend todemands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-liftingfrom Japanese buyers.    The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vesselsto store its production rather than cut its prices, they said.    Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below itsceiling, with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpdcompared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle EastEconomic Survey estimated.    "Of course there was a little cheating but not enough todestroy the market," an oil trader in Tokyo said.    Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market atdiscounted prices through barter deals and the swapping ofMiddle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades havenot generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said.    The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crudeunder term contracts in the second quarter is likely to beweaker, traders said.    Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said todayOPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present outputvolume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, orraising the production ceiling so members can produce more inthe third and fourth quarters of 1987.

reut2-013.sgm, JAPAN RULING PARTY SEEKS BIG SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET, The ruling Liberal Democratic Party hasdrawn up the guidelines of an economic package including asupplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen, a seniorparty official said.    It also urged the government to concentrate in the firsthalf of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a recordproportion of the year's public works spending, he said.    The LDP also suggested the government review the ceiling onbudgetary requests for investment in public works projectspresented by individual ministries, he added.    But the LDP official said the government should not abandonits fiscal reform target of ending the issue ofdeficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.    These measures should be treated as an emergency, partlybecause of the urgent need for Japan to redress its externaltrade imbalance with the U.S., He said.    The guidelines will be explained to the U.S. This week whenFinance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting, he added.    The official, the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council'sChairman Masayoshi Ito, told a press conference the proposedsupplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier thanAugust but before November.    The guideline will be the basis for a more detailedreflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29for talks with President Reagan, Ito said.    The full government-endorsed economic package is expectedto be announced in late May.    The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originallyincorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget, Ito said. The previousrecord for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87.    Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-primingmeasures should include the issue of construction bonds and theuse of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized NipponTelegraph and Telephone Corp stocks.    An LDP statement said the government should use theadditional budget mainly to encourage housing construction andto revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise. REUTER&#3;

But some speculative selling of the dollar was noted onconviction that the Bank of Japan will intervene less during ofthe meetings. The dollar ended at 145.15/20 yen against Tokyo's145.25 close and New York's final 145.85/90.    Dealers said, however, the Japanese central bank boughtdollar persistently throughout today and limited the dollar'sfalls.    The U.S. Unit eased to 1.8205/15 marks from an early1.8230/40 and New York's 1.8260/70 close.

Dealers said long maturities fluctuated between gains andlosses of around 10 pfennigs. Today's slight drop in the valueof the dollar and yesterday's modest gains on U.S. Creditmarkets had little impact on business here.

The 5.3 pct 95th bond of 1997 finishedat 4.010 pct against 4.165 at yesterday's close and an openingtoday of 4.100.

reut2-013.sgm, DOLLAR STARTS EASIER IN LONDON, STERLING FIRM, The dollar opened easier after markets inthe Far East had sold it down for yen, defeating new attemptsby the Bank of Japan to check the yen's rise through sustainedcurrency intervention, dealers said.    But trading was slow and uninsipired and although dollarsentiment remained bearish, especially against the yen, dealersexpected no major movements ahead of tomorrow's Group of Sevenfinance ministers' meeting.    Sterling remained well bid as two new opinion polls showedthat the ruling Conservative party had increased its stronglead, increasing the chances of an early election, they said.    The dollar opened at 145.05/15 yen compared with 146.00/10at yesterday's European close. It closed at 145.25 yen in Tokyoafter New York's 145.85/90.    The dollar opened at 1.8195/8205 marks after yesterday'sclose in Europe of 1.8245/55. It closed at 1.8205/15 in Tokyoafter finishing at 1.8260/70 in New York.    Sterling opened marginally weaker on its trade-weightedindex, dropping one basis point to 72.3. But it started firmerat 1.6213/23 dlrs against 1.6163/73 last night. It was alsofirmer against the mark.    The pound opened at 2.9540/9575 marks against 2.9490/9530in Europe last night. But it lost some ground shortly after theopening, trading quietly around 2.95 marks.    Dealers said that with uncertainty still surrounding thedollar, yen and mark, sterling looks strong and attractive ondue to an apparent surge of support for the ruling Conservativeparty, relatively high interest rates and a strong economy.    One opinion poll today showed the Conservatives had a13-point lead over the opposition Labour party and a 17-pointlead over the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance. Anotherforecast a 92 seat Conservative majority in a new parliament.    One dealer reported a large sterling buying order from aJapanese institution earlier today.    But dealers were cautious to push sterling much higher amidwariness of intervention by the Bank of England. The bank wasthought to have intervened repeatedly yesterday but it was notsighted in the market today, dealers said.    On the dollar, dealers said all eyes were turned toWashington where finance ministers and central bank governorsof the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will meettomorrow to review their February 22 Paris currencystabilisation pact.    Few expect the meeting to produce more than a vaguelyworded confirmation of the Paris goals of currency stabilityand increased economic cooperation.    This outcome would almost certainly lead to renewed dollarweakness, especially against the yen, with levels around 140yen well within reach, some dealers said.    "But you never know. Perhaps the Japanese do come up withsome sort of stimulation package that would satisfy the marketafter all," a dealer with a U.S. Bank said. He noted news thatJapan was working out a reflationary supplementary 1987 budget.    A senior official of the Japanese ruling Liberal DemocraticParty said earlier today the party has drawn up the outline ofa reflationary economic package including a 5,000 billion yensupplementary budget for fiscal 1987.    The dollar opened at 1.5130/40 Swiss francs against1.5180/90 in Europe. It opened at 6.0525/75 French francs, downfrom its European close of 6.0660/0710. REUTER&#3;

At0815 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 4.7 off at 1984.5.    Dealers said the effect of news today of two opinion polls,one of which, conducted for the television programme TV-AM,placing the Conservative party 13 points ahead of theOpposition Labour Party was offset by a belief that themarket's gains yesterday may have been overdone and that aperiod of consolidation is due.    An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper todaywhich measured party support in marginal seats gave the rulingConservative Party a lead of six points over the Labour Party.    Operators said although the market is generally convincedthe Conservatives will win the next general election,uncertainty over the date is continuing to provide anunsettling influence.    Among the leaders, ICI lost 2p at 1,333, Beecham 8p at 525and Glaxo 4p at 1,484 but Wellcome lost 25p at 393 onprofittaking, dealers said.

reut2-013.sgm, SINGAPORE STOCKS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE STRONG TREND, The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES)will likely be used to raise more than 1.5 billion dlrs in1987, continuing a long-term bullish trend that began last yearwhen about the same amount was tapped.    Stock analysts and economists said the trend will be helpedby low interest rates and the government's plan to sell 380 mlndlrs worth of shares in state enterprises each year for thenext 10 years, which should attract foreign interest.    One foreign analyst said international fund managers areincreasingly attracted to Asian markets like Singapore.    He said uncertainty over Hong Kong's future had helped theflow of funds to Singapore over the last eight to nine months.    Trade friction between Washington and Tokyo and the highvalue of the yen had also diverted a trickle of funds fromJapan.    But he added, "A slight trickle will have a large impact onthe local exchange."    Economists said the inflow from foreign institutions isdifficult to estimate but it is increasing as the localrecession bottoms out with the help of reduced corporate taxescuts and of lower wage costs.    Tan Soo Nan, director of the Development Bank of SingaporeSecurities Ltd and a member of the exchange, said he expectsSingapore companies alone to tap around one billion dlrs thisyear, but he warned there were some short-term risks.    Corporate earnings in fiscal 1987 ending March fell shortof an expected 20 pct increase over 1986 and a major failurewould dampen sentiment, he said. He added the SES should admitonly companies able to sustain their earnings levels.    But one foreign analyst said any slowing of activity wouldbe temporary and many investors are waiting for the results ofelections in Malaysia later this month.    On the whole, Tan said, the long-term trend remains bullishbecause of the economic recovery, the high growth potential forthe Asian Pacific region and the liberalisation of the Toykofinancial market.    Tan said the introduction of the Stock Exchange ofSingapore Dealing and Quotation System in January and the newgovernment securities market was in keeping with the globaltrend towards debt securitisation and financial deregulation.    Singapore's economic recovery will be more broad-based in1987 and the exchange's strategy should be to build upexpertise in risk and fund management, he said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, GERMAN BANK SUPERVISOR CALLS FOR WIDER REGULATION, West German banking regulations must beexpanded to cover off-balance sheet risks arising from newfinancing forms, Federal Banking Supervisory Office PresidentWolfgang Kuntze said.    Kuntze told bankers at a reception that deals for hedgingprice risks are not covered by current supervisory rules.    Such deals could be used for speculation and do not have tobe disclosed.    Kuntze also said it must be considered whether banks cancontinue not to set shareholders' equity and reserves againsttheir own holdings of securities.    Since early 1984, banks have been limited to lending 18times shareholders' equity and reserves on a consolidated basisand Bundesbank officials have said that interest rate andcurrency swaps and currency options are under scrutiny.    Authorities favour reinterpreting the banking law to fitpresent circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentarypolitical process of changing it, banking sources said.    Kuntze said solutions to the problem of banking supervisioncan be found without having to change the law again.    The risk structure in banking is moving away from the modelon which banking supervisory rules are based, Kuntze said.    Banking supervisors are still firemen with a safety net butthe safety net has become a little too small, he said.    Kuntze declined to detail possible changes to bankingregulations, as these are still the subject of discussionsbetween the Supervisory Office and the Bundesbank.    He said he sees no chance in the foreseeable future for aninternational harmonisation of supervisory law and the Germansupervisory office would not wait for such harmonisation.    Nor would it get involved in international competition onminimal regulatory standards in order to shield banks fromcompetitive disadvantages, he said. REUTER&#3;
reut2-013.sgm, COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE, The International Cocoa Organization(ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt thedowntrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buyingoperations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.    Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases couldreach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting pricessignificantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhangingthe market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as theICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 SpecialDrawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 "must buy" level.    Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed lastmonth by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the bufferstock manager has completed preparations, traders said.    Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay bufferstock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months usedto calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day averageabove the 1,600 SDR "must buy" level.    The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average ofthe second, third and fourth positions on the London and NewYork futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR pertonne yesterday.    Months used currently for the indicator are May, July andSeptember, but these are set to change to July, September andDecember on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spotmonth, traders noted.    The introduction of December into the calculations may liftthe daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75stg above May on the London terminal market.    But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for thehigher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, theindicator which governs his activities, traders said.    "The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at theimplications of delaying until forward prices lift theindicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa," ananalyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.    Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reachthis level within six months, buying is suspended pending anICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa marketwatchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recentforecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mlnto two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up tothree mln.    A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, comparedwith a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of94,000 tonnes, traders said.    In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need tobuy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the"must buy" level.    But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may putconstraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stockmanager can remove cocoa from the market.    The buffer stock system of price differentials setaccording to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases fromnon-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,dealers said.    Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock isnearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.    But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa asMalaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoacan only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the bufferstock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.    Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-membercocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which arepressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.    Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa fromquality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impacton futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums forthis cocoa over futures.    Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stgfrom 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of bufferstock buying, dealers said.    "The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but willprovide a backstop for quality cocoas," one trader said.    Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the bufferstock were "all prognostication" and that no one could hope topredict accurately what the result would be. Psychologicallybuffer stock buying should help prices, but since the bufferstock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from theprevious cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealersexpressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.    In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholdingscheme as an additional market support mechanism. REUTER&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, GERMAN CALL MONEY FIRMS ON TENDER, Call money firmed to about 3.65 pct,back to yesterday's 3.60/70 pct, from around 3.55 pct earliertoday after the Bundesbank announced a tender for a newsecurities repurchase pact, dealers said.    The Bundesbank offered funds over 28 days at 3.80 pct,unchanged from the rate on recent facilities.    Many traders had expected the tender rate to come down inline with market rates for call money.    When this did not happen, because of more than adequateliquidity, many participants decided to withdraw funds from themarket and use them to build up minimum reserves further.    This resulted in the slight rise in call money.    Banks held 58.9 billion marks at the Bundesbank on April 5,averaging 59.3 billion over the first five days of the month,well clear of the likely 51 billion mark minimum reserverequirement, dealers said.    There was therefore some surprise that the Bundesbank wasoffering more funds above the call money rate.    But some dealers noted that the rate on the 28 day facilitywas in line with one month money, which traded at 3.80/85 todayafter 3.80/90 yesterday and 3.90/4.00 on April 1.    Given market liquidity dealers said banks were likely tobid, and the Bundesbank allocate, less than the 14.9 billionmarks draining from the market tomorrow when an earlier pactexpires.    One dealer expected some 10 billion marks to be allocated.    Some dealers said the Bundesbank would have been unwillingto cut rates on this pact, as it is the first under its fasterand more flexible tender process and because a lower rate mighthave been associated with the new system.    Dealers said they still thought the Bundesbank would overthe next month lower the call money range from the narrow3.6-3.8 and broad 3.5-4.0 pct it has held recently. REUTER&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, NO INTERVENTION, DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8218 MARKS, The Bundesbank did not intervene asthe dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243yesterday, dealers said.    Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over theEuropean morning, with operators made wary by today's meetingof the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefsahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington.    It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of EconomicAdvisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S.Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar.    Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchangerates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting onFebruary 22, a "vague statement," casting doubt on operators'assumptions that a secret target level had been set.    Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progressto stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged,"there would not be the necessity of significant declines in thedollar."    One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tendedeasier after the remarks. "They were obviously regarded as beingnegative. And if the market starts regarding anything thatcomes out negatively then it means that the underlyingsentiment is negative," he said.    Some early selling pressure softened the dollar'sundertone.    Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japanto support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen byinstitutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said.    After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recentweeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31,interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said.    "We can start to look at a point in time where the interestshifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and theother European currencies," the U.S. Bank dealer said.    Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary oftaking significant new positions during the Washingtonmeetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today,Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the GermanAffairs group on international monetary issues later.    The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank seta new securities repurchase tender to add money marketliquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over thelast several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that itmight cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender,signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy.    Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller saidthe Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. Amonetary policy which took into account exchange rates andcapital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rateoriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment.    Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from2.957. The yen's unabated strength, despite the intervention,brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday's 1.2480.    The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per100. REUTER&#3;

It said the EC industrial production index, base 1980,stood at 103.9 in both months.    EC officials said while the lack of growth may have beendue in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of theEC in January, it also reflects a worrying trend.    Eurostat said for the last three months for which figuresare known, industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared withthe year-earlier period.    Annual growth in the 12 months to January averaged about1.8 pct, well below the 2.8 pct figure recorded in the 12months ending last June, the office said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, LONG DEBT FUTURES TURN EASIER IN LIFFE MORNING, Long debt futures turned easier in latemorning on the London International Financial Futures Exchange(LIFFE) as the dollar and sterling softened, dealers said.    Long gilt futures had a good start with an opening range of124-10/32 to 124-14/32 from 124-7/32 overnight as sentiment wasboosted by two opinion polls showing a comfortable lead for theruling Conservatives.    They made a high of 124-19/32 but met chart resistance. Awave of professional sales hit the market at 1000 GMT, drivingthe price to a low of 124 after minor support at 124-6/32 wasbreached.    This coincided with a dip in sterling to 72.2 on its trade-weighted index against 72.3 at the start and 72.4 last night.    At the same time, the dollar was dipping below 145 yenafter a night of pressure in the Far East.    June T-bond futures made lows of 97-18/32 and settledaround 97-21/32 at 1015 GMT after opening 8/32 easier at97-26/32.    Analysts said the markets remained cautious because of aseries of talks in Washington this week between financeministers of industrial countries.    June Eurodollars started at 93.33, a technical supportpoint, and eased to 93.30 or 0.06 below last night.    Analysts said sterling contracts would have difficultyadvancing beyond current levels if the market discounts theConservative victory predicted by the opinion polls.    Other difficulties were sterling's inability to breach the2.96 mark ceiling, which could indicate the Bank of England istrying hard to keep a lid on the U.K. Currency.    Also, market talk of a further base rate cut has died down,although another cut was virtually discounted by mid-March.    June short sterling futures were little changed in earlytrading from last night's 90.78 but slipped to a low of 90.73by late morning. Interbank interest rates were unchanged.    June FT-SE 100 futures saw an opening range of 204 to203.70 in line with last night's 203.80 but made a low of202.20 late morning.

reut2-013.sgm, DOLLAR STEADY NEAR LOWS AT LONDON MIDSESSION, The dollar was steady near lower openinglevels in extremely quiet trading and dealers did not expectthe U.S. Currency to move significantly before the series ofhigh-level monetary meetings starting today in Washington.    Sterling trading was equally quiet.    Bullishness on the back of two new opinion polls suggestingBritain's ruling Conservative party had increased its lead overthe opposition was checked by fears of fresh sterling-sellingintervention by the Bank of England, dealers said.    The dollar fetched 1.8215/25 marks at midsession against1.8195/8205 at the opening and 1.8245/55 in Europe last night.    The dollar was quoted at 145.10/20 yen, virtually unchangedfrom its opening 145.05/15 but sharply below yesterday'sEuropean closing 146.00/10.    It briefly dipped below 145 yen, to a quoted low of 144.85,but recovered later to trade quietly around opening levels,dealers said.    Trade-weighted, sterling stood at 72.3 pct of its 1975value, unchanged form the opening but one basis point belowyesterday's close. The pound fetched 2.9480/9520 marks and1.6190/6200 dlrs at midsession after its opening 2.9540/75 and1.6213/23, and yesterday's closing 2.9490/9530 and 1.6163/73.    Dealers said dollar business had virtually halted in Europeafter a large selloff against the yen in the Far East, whichsustained Bank of Japan intervention failed to stem earliertoday.    They said that in the absence of other factors,participants awaited the outcome of the informal talks of Groupof Five finance ministers and central bankers in Washingtontoday, and Group of Seven monetary talks tomorrow.    Most dealers expected the meetings to produce little morethan a vaguely worded statement to reaffirm shared objectivesof stable currency markets and economic policy coordination.    The Group of Five and Canada agreed in Paris on February 22to call a halt to the dollar's sharp decline, and severalparticipant central banks have since intervened to keepcurrencies within narrow ranges against each other.    But a flare-up of the long-standing trade frictions betweenthe U.S. And Japan last month encouraged markets to test theagreement, pushing the dollar sharply lower against the yen.    Dealers said that short of a convincing undertaking byJapan at the Washington talks to step up efforts to reducetrade surpluses and stimulate domestic demand, the dollar wouldresume its fall, especially against the yen.    Without agreement on the trade issue, the dollar appearsset to test support levels at 143 yen in the very short term,with 140 yen within reach over the next few weeks, dealerssaid.    Some dealers said Japan appears ready to compromise withthe U.S. On economic policy issues.    Expectations were rising of a further half-point cut in theJapanese discount rate and Japan's ruling Liberal DemocraticParty today announced an outline agreement on economicreflation which includes a 5,000 billion yen additional budgetfor 1987, the dealers said.    Some dealers said the market could get some impetus fromU.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker when he testifies onThird World debt problems before the Senate banking committeelater today.    Dealers said sterling remained firm amid growing confidencethe ruling Conservative party is assured of victory in anelection which they said would likely be called for June.    One poll out today showed the Conservatives leading with 43pct support against Labour's 30 pct and the Liberal-SocialDemocratic Alliance at 26 pct. Another poll forecast aConserative majority of 92 seats in a new parliament.    But wariness of Bank of England sterling-sellingintervention made participants cautious about pushing the poundmuch higher, dealers said.    Some dealers said the Bank of England was believed to haveintervened on a small scale yesterday but others said they hadnot detected such action. No polled dealer said he had sightedBank intervention today.    The dollar was quoted at 1.5110/20 Swiss francs atmidsession against 1.5130/40 at the opening and a 1.5180/90European close. It fetched 6.0575/0625 French francs against6.0525/75 at the opening and 6.0660/0710 at close. REUTER&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, GERMAN BONDS END QUIET BOURSE LOWER, Prices of public authority bonds endeda quiet bourse session lower, with domestic investors takingprofits in a technical reaction to recent strong gains.    Dealers said long maturities dropped as much as 50 pfennigsbut most paper lost around 20 pfennigs. Foreigners, which hadbeen buying and selling West German public authority bonds inpre-bourse business, remained sidelined during bourse trading.    Today's slight dollar drop and yesterday's modest gains onU.S. Credit markets had little impact. Dealers said this week'sG-7 meeting in Washington made investors wary and led to thesquaring of some positions.    Most dealers said underlying sentiment for bonds remainedfavourable and there were some speculations global interestrates could fall further in the not too distant future.    The Bundesbank bought 109.9 mln marks worth of publicauthority paper here after selling 80.7 mln yesterday.    The six pct 1997 federal government loan stock fell 40pfennigs to 102.90, 103.15.

Dealers said most of the trading appeared to beinter-professional, highlighting the market's cautious approachin the wake of yesterday's strong performance. The latestopinion polls strengthened the market's conviction that theConservatives will win the next general election, but theuncertainty over the date continues to provide an unsettlingfactor.

An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today,which measured party support in 73 key marginal seats, gave theConservative party a lead of six points over Labour.    Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan,although less pronounced, provides a further note of caution,dealers said. Yesterday the Japanese finance ministry said itwill help expand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership tofacilitate foreign membership.    The lack of enthusiasm for shares this morning despitegains to record territory on both the New York and Tokyo stockexchanges further underlined market nervousness.

reut2-013.sgm, U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - NARROW RANGES, After a few days of volatility, thecredit markets show signs of settling back into thefrustratingly narrow ranges that prevailed for much of thefirst quarter, economists said.    Friday's weak employment data for March braked an ascent inbond yields before the 30-year yield could reach thepsychologically important eight pct level.    But, with question marks hanging over the strength of theeconomy and, more critically, the value of the dollar,economists said the market remains fragile and will not quicklyrecoup the ground lost in the past two weeks.    The 30-year bond yield closed Monday at 7.84 pct, down from7.86 pct on Friday and a 12-month high last week of 7.93 pct,but trading was lackluster.    "People are sitting on the fence, they don't really knowwhat to do," said Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman BrothersInc. "Our retail accounts are not committing themselves eitherway."    No economic indicators are due today, but the markets willhear Congressional testimony from Fed chairman Paul Volcker at1000 EDT (1400 GMT) and will be alert for the possibility ofanother outright purchase of securities by the Fed.    The Fed needs to buy a large volume of securities at thistime of year to offset the reserve drain caused by a build-upof Treasury funds at the Fed around the April 15 tax date.    The Fed confounded most economists' predictions of a bill"pass" last week by buying instead a record 2.2 billion dlrs ofnotes and bonds, and Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham LambertInc said the Fed could make it two in a row by offering to buycoupon securities today or Wednesday.    The Fed will not buy bills since they are already inrelatively short supply after heavy Treasury paydowns inrecent weeks, she argued.    "They haven't paid down so many bills before in a quarter,"Ramirez said, noting that the Treasury has been able to reducethe size of its regular bill auctions because of strong taxrevenues following the reform of the tax code at the beginningof the year.    Because it would be unprecedented for the Fed to conductback-to-back coupon "passes", most economists still expect theFed to buy bills this week instead of bonds and notes.    After trading late yesterday at 6-1/8 pct, Fed funds wereindicated by brokers to open at 6-1/8, 6-1/4 pct. Reuter&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, VW CURRENCY DEPARTMENT FORMER HEAD ARRESTED, The former chief offoreign exchange at Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> has been arrested inconnection with a scandal which may have cost the car maker aquarter of a billion dlrs, the chief state prosecutor CarlHermann Retemeyer said.    He told Reuters that Burkhard "Bobby" Junger was arrestedyesterday for suspected embezzlement.    "There is reason to believe that Junger could have evadedjustice, and investigating magistrates therefore asked for hisarrest," Retemeyer said.    VW fired Junger in March, after news emerged of thesuspected foreign exchange swindle. In January the board gavehim leave of absence. Six other people have been suspended.    VW said last month computer programs were erased anddocuments faked in the possible fraud, in which it believestransactions meant to protect it against foreign currencylosses were not completed.    Retemeyer said "We are still investigating a larger circleof people, among them Frankfurt currency dealers"    He would not comment whether other arrests could beexpected.    The possible fraud resulted in a major management shake-upwith the resignation of Rolf Selowsky, management board memberin charge of finance, who assumed managerial responsibility forthe affair.    Retemeyer said last month he wanted to questionFrankfurt-based money broker Joachim Schmidt, who may be ableto give more details. REUTER&#3;

An agency statement estimated the epicentre of the quake,which struck at 0940 hrs (0040 GMT), as being under the sea offFukushima prefecture, some 240 km north of Tokyo.    On March 18, a quake also registering 6.9 on the Richterscale hit southwest Japan, killing two people.    Earthquakes of force six on the Richter scale are capableof causing widespread, heavy damage in a populated area.

reut2-013.sgm, ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - FOREIGN BANKS IN GERMANY, Foreign banks in West Germany arereassessing their positions after a number of changes in themarkets and the regulatory environment that have dampened aonce-euphoric enthusiasm for expansion here.    Banking sources said the most important changes were plansto bring securities holdings into capital lending ratios, thefirst such move in a major financial centre. This could place aserious burden on several foreign banks, particularly thoseactive in primary and secondary bond markets. Foreign banks hadmuch lower equity and reserve capital than most domestic banks.    Senior banking sources said talks between the Bundesbankand the banking supervisory office over bringing securities --primarily bonds -- under banking laws governing capital ratioswere in progress.    Although no date had been set for imposition, banks asearly as this year may be obliged to bring bonds under 1985rules that limit bank lending to 18 times shareholders equityand reserves.    Although other national regulatory authorities are known tobe considering similar steps in light of growing securitisationof debt previously in the balance sheet, Germany, with itstradition of prudence, may be the first.    Brian Kissack, president of the Foreign Banks Association,told Reuters, "It's not a positive sign. It could cause certainpeople who are not in (West Germany) to query whether it was asattractive to get in now."    Larger banks may begin to use global networks to pass onholdings in mark securities to other centres which had lessstringent ratios, taking business out of the country, he added.    But sources said foreign banks faced a host of otherpractical problems as well. These included,    -- the apparent unwillingness of the Bonn government tomake an early move to abolish the stock exchange turnover tax.    -- signs that London's "Big Bang" may have deeperimplications for German securities trading than first thought.    -- difficulty in finding experienced securitiesprofessionals to staff new subsidiaries.    -- growing pressure on commercial banking margins that isforcing widespread retrenchment and refocusing of activities.    -- the threat of having to face a renewed push for marketshare by the largest and most powerful Japanese banks.    By leaving the stock exchange turnover tax out of theinitial negotiating session of the incoming federal coalitiongovernment, Bonn had dashed hopes it would soon be abolished.    The tax is 0.25 pct on each side of a securities trade by anon-bank, but it is not levied on public authority bonds.    This extra cost, particularly for finely-priced instrumentssuch as floating rate notes, had kept much mark securitiesbusiness firmly in the City, awaiting a change. But aside fromthis, London was more active than domestic houses had expected.    Large U.S., British, Japanese and Swiss investors oftenpreferred to execute block trades -- 50,000 shares and up --with City market makers who could absorb at least some of thepaper in their own positions, diminishing the immediate impacton the share price.    Most German brokers and banks pass trades direct to theexchange floor, cutting profits or adding to costs.    Bank in Liechstenstein (Frankfurt) GmbH board memberMichael Zapf said London's share of German securities businessdone was causing foreign banks without German units to weighwhether establishment costs involved were worth the returns.    Additional signs that London market makers may move intosecondary level stocks had added to this concern, he said.    Now, plans by many foreign banks to transfer marksecurities trading entirely to newly established, mainlyFrankfurt-based units were being reassessed, sources said.    The continuing existence of the stock exchange tax had alsoeffectively prevented the birth of a short-term mark papermarket in certificates of deposit or commercial paper.    Many U.S. Investment and money centre banks in particularwere hoping experience in these would provide the lever toprise open tight credit relationships between companies andtheir domestic "house" banks.    At the moment, U.S. Investment banks are expanding fastesthere. A unit of Salomon Inc &lt;SB.N> began last summer and MorganStanley Group Inc &lt;MS.N> is currently fitting out offices,probably for a summer start to business.    A unit of &lt;Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co> should beginoperations toward year end. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER.N>and Shearson Lehman Brothers are known to be weighingconversion of current, small operations to full-standing units.    But expansion had been hampered by the lack of experiencedpersonnel in a hitherto fairly small market. The big threeSwiss banks, which arrived between late 1985 and first half1986, have been steadily building up securities departments,taking staff equally from domestic and foreign competitors.    The two U.S. Banks longest established here, Citibank AGand Chase Bank AG, had been particularly hard hit.    Both banks recently announced plans to cut back commercialactivities and shut down German branch offices on orders fromhead office. In the competitive environment, return on assetsemployed was insufficient to meet requirements, sources said.    But the weakening attraction of "Financial Centre Germany"was unlikely to deter major Japanese banks from setting up fullsubsidiaries when the Bundesbank gives the green light for markeurobond lead management probably around third quarter 1987.    Once banks such as Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd &lt;DIKB.T> andSumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> move in, competition for business,for staff and even for premises would soar, sources said. REUTER&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, JAPAN RULING PARTY SEEKS BIG SUPPLEMENT BUDGET, The ruling Liberal Democratic Party hasdrawn up the guidelines of an economic package including asupplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen, a seniorparty official said.    The official, the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council'sChairman Masayoshi Ito, told a press conference the proposedsupplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier thanAugust but before November.    It also urges the government to concentrate in the firsthalf of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a recordproportion of the year's public works spending.    The guidelines will be explained to the U.S. this week whenFinance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for themeetings with the IMF and G-7 ministers, Ito added.    The LDP suggested the government review the ceiling onbudgetary requests for investment in public works projectspresented by individual ministries, Ito said.    But the LDP official said the government should not abandonits fiscal reform target of ending the issue ofdeficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.    These measures should be treated as an emergency, partlybecause of the urgent need for Japan to redress its externaltrade imbalance with the U.S., He said.    The guideline will be the basis for a more detailedreflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29for talks with President Reagan, Ito said.    The full government-endorsed economic package is expectedto be announced in late May.    The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originallyincorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget, Ito said. The previousrecord for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87.    Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-primingmeasures should include the issue of construction bonds and theuse of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized NipponTelegraph and Telephone Corp stocks.    An LDP statement said the government should use theadditional budget mainly to encourage housing construction andto revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise. Reuter&#3;

In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunicationsministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the wayTokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing tradeimbalance between the two countries.    "I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister thatI was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abruptdeterioration in the trading relations of our countries whichwould have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,"Howard told reporters.    "He listened very carefully and I have little doubt themessage got home," he added.    British frustration over the lopsided trade balance -nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - hasreached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howardsaid.    Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable andWireless from having a major role in the internationaltelephone market in Japan.    "I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as Iwant a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in tradingrelations," Howard said. "We simply aren't prepared to continueto accept the imbalance which has been the position for such along time."    Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unableto comment on Howard's meeting with their minister.    But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign MinisterTadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan areincreasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.    Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunicationsdispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.    Howard told reporters that Britain was actively consideringpossible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on thetelecommunications issue.    "There are measures which are under consideration if wecontinue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,"he added, but gave no details.    He said he had received a reassuring response from theJapanese he has spoken with.    "But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanesefor quite some time," he added. "What I've made plain is weexpect to see action."

The Ivory Coast was believed offering new crop around 1,325French francs per 100 kilos cif while Ghana was offering around1,460 stg a tonne cif for Dec/Feb-Jan/Mar, dealers said.    Volume midday was 1,013 lots including 130 crosses.    Apart from the prospect of ICCO buffer stock buying in thenear future, the only other bullish feature on the immediatehorizon is the recently lower trade forecast for Bahia'stemporao crop which ranged between 1.5 and 2.0 mln bags from2.0 to 2.5 mln bags previously and compared with initialexpectations of three mln bags, dealers said.    Some traders are now saying the temporao is more likely tobe near the lower end of the new range although this could beoffset by a higher than expected Ivory Coast mid-crop.

He told Reuters that Burkhard "Bobby" Junger was arrestedyesterday for suspected embezzlement.    "There is reason to believe that Junger could have evadedjustice, and investigating magistrates therefore asked for hisarrest," Retemeyer said.    VW fired Junger in March, after news emerged of thesuspected foreign exchange swindle. In January the board gavehim leave of absence. Six other people have been suspended.    VW said last month computer programs were erased anddocuments faked in the possible fraud, in which it believestransactions meant to protect it against foreign currencylosses were not completed.    Retemeyer said, "We are still investigating a larger circleof people, among them Frankfurt currency dealers"    He would not comment whether other arrests could beexpected.    The possible fraud resulted in a major management shake-upwith the resignation of Rolf Selowsky, management board memberin charge of finance, who assumed managerial responsibility forthe affair.    Retemeyer said last month he wanted to questionFrankfurt-based money broker Joachim Schmidt, who may be ableto give more details. Reuter&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, TREASURY'S BAKER TO HOLD TALKS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Bakerholds talks with counterparts from Europe and Japan today, tourge them to carry out commitments in a recent accord to speedtheir economic growth.    Baker is also expected to outline proposals for makingagreements to coordinate economic policies more binding.    The bilateral discussions foreshadow full-blown talks ofthe Group of Five industrial countries joined later by Italyand Canada to form the Group of Seven.    The five comprise finance ministers and central bankers ofthe United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.    The Treasury Secretary is expected to see Japanese FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawa, West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg and British Chancellor of the Exchequer NigelLawson.    Baker and other finance ministers say they intend toreaffirm the Paris Agreement to buttress global economicgrowth, reduce trade imbalances and stabilize currencies.    Monetary sources said a short communique to that effect isexpected after the meeting ends.    These talks form part of this week's semi-annual meetingsof the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.    At the same time, monetary sources say they expect Baker toput forward proposals, originally outlined at the 1986 TokyoSummit, to tighten procedures for policy coordination.    Washington wants other major nations to establish specificpolicy goals for economic growth, inflation, current accountbalance of payments, trade balances, budget performance,monetary conditions and currencies.    If actual economic performance veers sharply away from suchobjectives, then countries should consult on whether correctiveaction is necessary, the proposal says.    Monetary sources said there was some support for theproposal, which may not be made final until the Venice EconomicSummit in June, but Britain and West Germany were firmlyagainst any attempt to make corrective action automatic.    The U.S. Treasury team, led by Baker, has worked on thisplan since last September, when it won the support of France.    Baker, meanwhile, will press Japan and West Germany to liveup to their commitments, made over six weeks ago in Paris, toboost their domestic demand to absorb more imports.    He is also expected to reassure his counterparts that theReagan administration will reach agreement with Congress on asignificant budget deficit cut this year, helping to depressU.S. demand for imports.    The aim of the Paris Accord is to redress the hugeimbalance between the trade surpluses of Tokyo and Bonn on theone hand, and Washington's massive trade deficit on the other.    Japan, in particular, is under pressure to come up with ameaningful stimulus package or face a further rise in the yen.    Financial markets appear to believe the yen should gohigher against the dollar, a development that has becomeunacceptable in Japan.    The Paris Agreement, by the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain and Canada, called for currencies tobe stabilized around current levels.    But the dollar fell again just several weeks after theagreement was reached, and its present stability is said to betemporary as dealers await the outcome of this week's talks.    Meanwhile, representatives of the leading Third Worldcountries continue preparing their position for their ministersto present to industrial nations later this week.    Monetary sources said the so-called Group of 24 developingnations are preparing a very tough communique which brands thewestern strategy for shoring up the debt strategy as a failure.    They call instead for vast new assistance from theindustrial world and a much greater role for the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Bank. Reuter&#3;

But they cautioned that the market isdue for a pause after such a strong climb and could move into ashort term consolidation today as well.    Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial average closed abovethe 2400 mark for the first time ever. Special situations,airlines and a strong bond market helped push the average up 15points to end the day at 2406. Gainers led losers by seven-sixon the Big Board, while volume slid slightly to 175 mln sharesfrom 213 mln shares last Friday.    "I think we'll get a day that will be, on balance,positive, but not any record setter," Thom Brown of Butcher andSinger said.    Brown said that the market needs a pause before anystronger advance. "We need a bit of consolidation here," hesaid. "Eighty-five points is just too much, too soon."    Brown added that the market probably will not pay muchattention to the February consumer credit number being releasedtoday. "The market's been ignoring fundamentals," he said.    "I don't see any problems with the Blue Chips easing highertoday," Chris Callies of Dean Witter said. But she said themarket may have some short term trouble in this 2400 area."We're still in the midst of a correction" in the broad market,she said.

reut2-013.sgm, DOLLAR OPENS LOWER IN NEW YORK, The dollar opened lower following thetrend set earlier in the Far East and Europe, dealers said.    Still, the U.S. currency remained well within recenttrading ranges because few operators are prepared to go out ona limb ahead of today's meeting of Group of Five financeministers and central bankers in Washington.    The overnight sell-off was partly due to skepticism thatthis week's monetary talks will yield new or lasting measuresto stabilise currencies. But whatever their opinions, U.S.dealers remained cautious of selling the dollar aggressively.    The dollar opened at 145.10/20 yen, down from 145.85/90.    The dollar's decline occurred despite renewed Bank of Japanintervention on its behalf in Tokyo, dealers noted. Dealers inJapan said the central bank bought dollars steadily for yenduring Tokyo hours.    "There were some large sell-orders in Tokyo, but apparentlyit wasn't too hectic," said a dealer at one major U.S. bank."The tone still is very cautious ahead of the Washingtonmeetings."    The dollar also opened at 1.8220/30 marks, down from1.8260/70 at last night's close, and at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs,down from 1.5180/90.

reut2-013.sgm, PALM OIL OUTPUT SEEN DROPPING SHARPLY - OIL WORLD, Malaysian and Indonesian palm oilproduction is likely to drop sharply this year, due to loweryields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    The publication expects total Malaysian output duringJan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. ForEast Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.    It said new plantings had slowed markedly in bothcountries, but the effects of this will not be felt until1988-90.    Above normal yields during recent years resulted in treesreacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more maleinflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.    Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affectedthis year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This couldespecially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June,while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April andJuly/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.    Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year'syields and bigger effects are expected within the next threeyears, Oil World said without elaborating.    Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this yearwere put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 inJanuary 1986, Oil World said.    West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of EastMalaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.    Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall abouteight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. OverallIndonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pctto 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however,are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.    Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements areboth running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects thecountry's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes duringJan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead ofthe April elections and the religious Ramadan festivalthroughout May, it said.    Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recentIndonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter thecountry but be transshipped to other countries to fulfillIndonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.

reut2-013.sgm, SPAIN'S SOCIALISTS HOLD OUT AGAINST STRIKERS, Widespread strikes have not seriouslydisrupted Spain's economy and wage restrictions are likely tocontinue as policy makers call for more austerity to help thecountry compete in the European Community (EC), foreign bankersand analysts said.    "The strikes were unexpected and in some cases spectacular,but they have had little effect on basic economic life," a U.S.Banker told Reuters. "The socialists can apply restrictivemeasures as long as the unions remain relatively weak."    The communist-led Workers' Commissions recently rejected acall by its leadership for a general strike while the rulingSocialist Party's trade union arm, the General Workers' Union,has refused to demonstrate with the communists on May 1.    The government's chief concern is inflation, which stood at8.3 pct last year. The high inflation rate is especiallydamaging in view of Spain's trade balance with Europe, whichturned into a deficit last year after entry to the EC.    Officials say the situation is rapidly deteriorating. Thedeficit of 450 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 wasonly slightly below the 515 mln dlr deficit for all of 1986.    The government has tightened up money supply, called formaximum 5.0 pct wage increases -- the same as this year'sinflation target -- and is pursuing a program of industrialrestructuring despite an unemployment rate of 21.5 pct.    Bankers say tight-money policies have attracted anavalanche of foreign capital that is cashing in on the strongpeseta and high interest rates and those funds, converted intopesetas, are swelling money supply still further.    Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said last week thatmoney supply is expected to rise 14.3 pct in the first quartercompared with this year's eight pct target.    Most analysts agree that the government will have to acceptinflation closer to six pct this year but they say there islittle cause for alarm.    "The money supply should be back on track by the summer andwe will begin to see lower interest rates," said AndresTrujillo, general manager of Hong Kong and Shanghai BankingCorp's Madrid branch.    He told Reuters the labour protests, despite occasionaloutbursts of violence, are not having a serious impact onforeign investment.    "Spain is a big and relatively underdeveloped market," hesaid. "It is still easier to compete from here than in othercountries and this sporadic unrest is not likely to scare offinvestors."    Juan Jose Macaya, general manager of Investban SA, aportfolio management company, said he expects monetaryobjectives to be under control in two or three months.

reut2-013.sgm, U.S. CREDIT MARKETS OPEN LOWER, U.S. credit markets opened lower,undercut by a weaker dollar, dealers said.    The impetus for the opening declines came from overseastrading, where a lack of retail buying led to profit-takingthat erased yesterday's moderate gains, dealers said.    Most investors have stepped to the sidelines to await theoutcome of this week's monetary meetings in Washington and tosee how it affects exchange rates, they added.    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond opened 17/32 lower at95-22/32 to yield 7.88 pct compared with 7.84 pct atyesterday's close. It fell to 95-26/32 in late Tokyo trade.    "How the bond market trades seems to be a mirror image ofhow the dollar/yen trades," a dealer said. "As the dollar goes,so goes the market, but so far we're just bouncing around inthin trading."    Skepticism that this week's monetary meetings of leadingindustrial nations in Washington will produce substantiveagreements to ease trade tensions between the U.S. and Japanand take pressure off the dollar is weighing on bond prices.    "I can't imagine that anything of much substance couldcomoe out of these meetings other than a reiteration ofprevious statements," a dealer said.    Dealers said U.S. government securities prices will bevulnerable as long as further dollar declines are expected.    The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/16 to 99-20/32 at theopening and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 11/32 to 97-25/32.    Treasury bill rates rose in early trading, pulled higher insympathy with the rise in coupon yields.    Three-month bills were unchanged from yesterday's auctionprice at 5.53 pct bid, while six-month bills rose six basispoints from their auction price to 5.69 pct bid.    Year bills rose four basis points to 5.77 pct bid.    The Federal funds rate opened at 6-1/8 pct and remained atthis level in early trading. It averaged 6.20 pct yesterday.    Economists said seasonal pressures on bank reserves pointto a possible indirect injection of temporary reserves by theFederal Reserve this morning. Some look for the Fed to purchasecoupon securities this afternoon.    Dealers said the market may take its next cue from FederalReserve chairman Paul Volcker's Congressional testimony at 1000EDT (1400 GMT) this morning. Reuter&#3;
reut2-013.sgm, AIRBUS TO USE GE &lt;GE> ENGINE ON A-340 AIRLINER, The European &lt;Airbus Industrie> consortiumis to change the lead engine on its A-340 aircraft because thehigh-technology superfan engine will not be ready by 1992, acompany spokesman said.   Airbus has chosen the Franco-U.S. CFM-56-S3 engines toreplace the &lt;International Aero Engine> (IAE) consortium'ssuperfan. The spokesman added the new engine, to be produced byGeneral Electric Co of the U.S. And SNECMA of France, canprovide greater thrust than the IAE rival.    The spokesman said the IAE consortium, which includes Prattand Whitney of the U.S. And Britain's &lt;Rolls Royce>, is unableto supply its superfan engines in time for mid-1992 when theA-340 is due to become operational.    Airbus signed an agreement with IAE last December,replacing an earlier accord with GE and &lt;SNECMA>, whose CFM-56engine could then offer no more than a 28,600 lbs thrust,compared to the proposed superfan's 30,000 lbs.    The latest version of the CFM-56, however, can provide a30,600 lbs thrust.    The Airbus spokesman said the consortium's decision did notexclude the IAE superfan, once ready, being offered as analternative engine on the A-340 as the superfan was morefuel-efficient than the CFM engine.    The spokesman said Airbus expected IAE to come back withsome proposals on superfan's new production timetable withinthe next few weeks or months. Reuter&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, COLOMBIA ARRANGING TWO CO-FINANCINGS FOR PROJECTS, Colombia is in the process of arrangingtwo co-financings for projects in the electrical sector,director of public credit Mauricio Cabrera said.    He told journalists he expects an 86.6 mln dlr loan to beco-financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to becompleted by the middle of next month.    He also said talks have just concluded with the World Bankon a 200 mln dlr co-financing and that discussions with thebankers will begin later this month.    Cabrera was here for the signing yesterday of a 50 mln dlrfloating rate note.    The floating rate note was the first such issue forColombia, which has had limited access to the internationalcapital markets since the eruption of the international debtcrisis in 1982, despite its ability to avoid a rescheduling.    The IADB co-financing is for Interconexion Electrica SA(ISA), a public electricity utility. The loan is for 10 years,with four years grace. Interest will be at 1-1/8 pct during thegrace period after which the margin will rise to 1-1/4 pct,Cabrera said. There is also a front end fee of one pct.    The cost of the project totals 301.6 mln dlrs, of which ISAwill contribute about 100 mln and the IADB 115 mln, he added.    Fuji Bank Ltd and Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd are arrangingthe commercial bank portion of the financing. Cabrera notedthat only about 20 pct of the loan will be drawn this year.    He said the World Bank co-financing is likely to come tothe market no earlier than June. It is part of an overallfinancing for various projects in the electrical sector thatwill take four years and cost about 300 mln dlrs a year.    Of the total cost, he expects the World Bank and the IADBto contribute about 700 mln dlrs, with the Export-Import Bankof Japan lending between 200 and 300 mln. The balance will comefrom commercial banks.    Cabrera said that Colombia also plans one other issue inthe international capital markets this year.    The country expected to launch up to 120 mln dlrs infloating rate notes, but the market has virtually disappearedin the past few months as supply outstripped demand and thenumber of market makers contracted sharply.    Cabrera said he is now considering several options,including a fixed rate Eurobond and an issue in Japan. Lastyear Colombia arranged a private placement in Japan for theequivalent of about 40 mln dlrs. Although it prefers a publicissue, Colombia would place any financing in Japan privately.    Bankers noted that the floating rate note signed yesterday,which was for seven years with four years grace and paid 1-1/8pct over Libor, was basically a "disguised loan."    Cabrera said that as of December 31, 1986, Colombia had 11billion dlrs of public sector foreign debt and 3.4 billion dlrsof private sector debt.    Of its planned total borrowings this year of two billiondlrs, he said that about 1.4 billion had been arranged beforethe end of 1986 and that most of the borrowings in 1987 will bedrawn in future years.

reut2-013.sgm, VOLCKER WARNS AGAINST SIZEABLE DLR DECLINE, Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollarcould be counterproductive for world economic growth.    Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volckersaid that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growthin those countries was also decreasing.    "In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciationof the dollar could well be counterproductive," he said.    Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has notbeen enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volckersaid.    On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not saywhether it should be higher or lower to restore balance intrade.    "What we do know is that a substantial exchange rateadjustment has already been made," he said.    "That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of agrowing world economy and fiscal restraint in the UnitedStates, to support the widespread expectations of a narrowingin the real trade deficit in the period ahead," he said.    Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantiallywhile import growth should slow.    Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with aminimum of inflationary pressure, the United States would haveto slow its spending growth.    It would also have to achieve a better balance betweeninvestment and domestic savings if it wants to be able todispense with foreign capital.    "The constructive way to work in the needed direction wouldbe to reduce our budget deficit, year by year, paving the wayfor improvements in our trade accounts," he said.    Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would riskrenewed inflation, he said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-013.sgm, WALL STREET STOCKS/MARION LABS &lt;MKC>, Marion Laboratories Inc's stock rosesharply today after the company presented a bullish earningsscenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday,traders and analysts said.    The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987,ending June 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago.    That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen ofSanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates forthe company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to hisprevious estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the companyearned 70 cts a share.    Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2.    At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion'spresident Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 "are expected to causeeven the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low."    Lyons said the strong performance in the second half ofthis year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said thatCardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approvedfor the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year.    Crossen said "because Marion is still just a small company,the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottomline." He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs ashare from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share.    "The company has a broad new product pipeline in theindustry and as far as I am concerned, it is the mostinnovative company in the business," he said.    For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion tohave a growth rate of 55 pct. Reuter&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, U.S. CALLS FOR GREATER GATT CHECKS ON TRADE, The United States has appealed forstronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) to enforce world trade rules.    The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smithat a special committee meeting into the future of GATT followsa series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts bythe 93-nation body to promote fair trade.    Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade roundlaunched by ministers last September. The round, which covers13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods andservices will take four years to negotiate.    Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financialinstitutions such as the International Monetary Fund and WorldBank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers toensure the success of the Uruguay Round.    "The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened toassure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of theworld trading system and the global economy," Smith said.    "Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy."    He also also urged that member states be accountable toeach other for their trade policies.    Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with EuropeanCommunity (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted tostress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.    "We are interested in more periodic ministerialinvolvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings," he said.    GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord onsemiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT traderules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanesechips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT disputepanel be set up to review the agreement.    President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay traderound to promote freer trade, has said Washington will imposetariffs against Japanese electronic goods.

"There is clearly a danger that adequate financingarrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in atimely way," Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee.

Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive towork together, Volcker said.    Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it wascritically important that markets be kept open by theindustrial nations.

reut2-013.sgm, BUNDESBANK RETAINS MONEY SUPPLY POLICY, Bundesbank council member LotharMueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policyand that restraining money supply growth does not always meanpushing up interest rates.    Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitungfinancial daily that a monetary policy which took into accountexchange rate expectations and capital flows could not beconfused with an exchange rate oriented policy.    The article followed international press speculation thatthe Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favourof an exchange rate policy.    Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his positionas president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria,noted that the Bundesbank's decision in January to cut leadinginterest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had ledsome people to think it was dropping monetary targetting.    "Simply to ignore the external economic context would berisky and dangerous for monetary policy," he explained.    Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put anend to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could nowassume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currencyinflows slow down.    Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short andlong term interest rate differentials, also encouragedinvestors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Muellersaid.    The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetarygrowth back onto the desired path, he said.    "Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep thisquiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with thechanged economic situation of the last few months," he added.    "All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its moneysupply policy with the January discount rate cut, despitesuppositions to the contrary," Mueller said.    "Keeping money supply developments in check is not alwayssynonymous with raising interest rates, especially whenexcessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather thangrowth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetaryholdings of non-banks," Mueller said.    Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficitsother concepts were needed for monetary policy.    Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous formonetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.    In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S.Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.    But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end ofa strict stability policy because both interest rates andliquidity would be affected by required currency interventionand could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.    Even interest rates are not in the centre of theBundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and othermarket conditions, Mueller said.    A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence centralbank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator.    This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidityof industry and households which cannot be directly reachedwith the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said.    The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, theharder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly beenthe case recently, because non-banks have received considerablesums from current account surpluses and capital imports.    "If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply risewith higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate ifcredit was growing excessively, it would not only have missedits target but probably even set off further inflows," he said.    Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.    In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rateof seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.    The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three tosix pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stockgrowth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.    But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and thereshould be no change in priorities. "Monetary policy must befirst and foremost stability policy and successful stabilitypolicy is money supply policy -- nothing else," he said. REUTER&#3;

It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plansto attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyoaccord in the light of events in Paris in February this year.    On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of itsG-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France,Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earliersession of talks involving G-5 members.    Today's statement from the Italian Treasury said-    "Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it tobe remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for theenlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever "themanagement or the improvement of the international monetaryeconomic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.'"    Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on thegrounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France and Britain, had reduced Italy's role to rubberstamping agreements already taken.

But it islikely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;AirbusIndustrie> A340 aircraft.    The company's so-called "pathfinder prospectus" gives all thedetails of its stock market flotation except for the price atwhich shares will be offered.    Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rosein 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.    Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profitfor 1987.    Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profitsand a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rollsoperated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.    Assuming the company was valued at around eight timesearnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of theaerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.    BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.    The price will be increased by it being likely to have muchof its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure thecompany's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls wasrescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.    When the government announced the sale, it said it wouldinject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.    Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a creditrating to match those of its main competitors such as GeneralElectric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Prattand Whitney unit.

reut2-013.sgm, EQUITIES DRIFT LOWER ON EASIER WALL STREET OPENING, Equities drifted lower after the easieropening on Wall Street, but the London market was depressedfrom the outset on lack of interest and a feeling thatyesterday's gains were overdone, dealers said.    Much of today's business was inter-professional, butdealers noted that despite today's falls and low volume themarket still had a firm, although cautious, undertone. At 1430GMT the FTSE 100 index was down 8.1 points at 1,981.5 comparedwith an opening 1,987.4.    Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan,although less pronounced, provided further caution.    Yesterday, the Japanese finance ministry made moves to tryand dispel fears of a trade war by saying it will help toexpand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership to facilitateforeign membership.    However, British corporate affairs minister Michael Howardhas told Japan to resolve the row over Cable and Wireless'shareholding in a new Japanese telecommunications company orface an abrupt deterioration in trade relations.    Cable and Wireless, which has been at the centre of thetrade row, was up 2p at 372.    The latest media opinion polls helped to underpin prices asthey strengthened the belief that the ruling Tory party willwin the next U.K. General election. Although there is stilluncertainty over the timing of the election, most dealerspolled by Reuters this afternoon thought that June would be themost likely time.    A poll conducted for the breakfast television programmeTV-AM showed the Conservatives 13 points ahead of theOpposition Labour Party, while a poll in the Times newspaper,which measured party support in 73 key marginal seats, gave theTories a lead of six points over the labour opposition.    Market leader ICI stood unchanged at 1,335 but IC Gasslipped 14p to 752 on profit-taking after yesterday's stonggain while Jaguar rose 15p to 590 mainly on U.S demand ahead ofa motor show in New York.    Pharmaceuticals had Wellcome down 23p to 397 on furtherprofit-taking in the wake of adverse press comment on the sideeffects of its "Retrovir" aids drug. London International Groupgained 13p to 301 as operators switched out of Wellcome.    Extel lost a net 26p to 464 in the wake of yesterday's newsthat Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corpwould not be making a bid for the company.    In a generally easier oil sector, BP fell 18p to 912 afteryesterday's statement by Standard Oil that it considered BP's70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of the company itdoes not already own as "inadequate."    In banks, Standard Chartered lost 4p to 820 after itsrecent gains on the back of bid rumours, but dealers notedpress speculation that Australian businessman Robert HolmesA'Court had increased his stake in the company yesterday.    Many operators expect Lloyds bank to renew its offer forStandard once its one year bid limit ends in July, althoughsome dealers thought this unlikely. Lloyds gained 1p to 488.    Elsewhere, industrial group Norcros gained 9p to 448 onspeculation of a bid for the company, while food retailer Tescoadded 2p to 475 after extending its 151 mln stg contested bidfor Hillards Plc until May 1. Hillards was a penny up at 314.    Government bonds stood generally lower in late trading withprices drifting down on a lack of interest. Gilts gained around5/16 point at the outset on the back of the opinion polls.    Equities tended to move up in later quiet trading as WallStreet rallied from its early lows. At 1556 GMT the FTSE 100was down just 4.7 points at 1,984.9 after a low of 1,977.2 at1354 GMT.    Dealers said most in the market appear to expect shareprices to move higher tomorrow, but volume will remainrelatively light ahead of an announcement of the election date.    They said given the thin trading conditions the market'smovements will be volatile in the coming few sessions. REUTER&#3;

reut2-013.sgm, LONDON MONEY MARKET CLOSES LITTLE CHANGED, Money market interest rates closed littlechanged after a quiet session as yesterday's talk of lower U.K.Base lending rates fizzled out, dealers said.    Further opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Partywell ahead had little effect on the market with operatorslooking for more definite news on the political front. Sterlingcontinued quietly steady ahead of the Group of Seven talks inWashington this week.    One senior money broker commented, "What we want is anelection date to put a stop to all the speculation. Once themarket knows what's happening then we can move forward."    The next move in U.K. Base rates, which now stand at 10pct, is still expected to be down but uncertainty over the dateof a general election is making for cautious trading, dealerssaid.    Yesterday, opinion polls showing the Government was set toretain a substantial working majority lifted sterling andfuelled speculation about lower U.K. Interest rates.    The British authorities are likely to remain cautious,however, as the G-7 finance ministers meeting is set to reviewtheir February Paris accord on currency stability. This couldaffect sterling which today was just one basis point lower intrade weighted terms to stand at 72.3.    Dealers noted that longer dated paper again dominated theday-to-day dealings between the discount houses and the Bank ofEngland. As rates fell yesterday, no band four bills, whichhave a maturity of between two and three months weretransacted. Today, however, these again appeared but themajority of the Bank's assistance was provided in the one totwo months range.    The key one and three months interbank rates were unchangedquoted at 10-1/16 9-15/16 and 9-7/8 3/4 pct respectively. Untilfresh economic or political news emerges, dealers say theyexpect the market to continue around these levels with onlytechnical factors provoking small fluctuations in rates.    The Bank of England forecast a 900 mln stg shortage in thesystem today but provided only 713 mln stg assistance. Despitethis, overnight interbank traded in the 11 to 10 pct rangehaving started the day at around 10-1/4 10 pct.    Period interbank rates were little changed with six monthsquoted at 9-3/4 5/8 and one year at 9-5/8 1/2 pct.    Sterling CDs were also mostly steady with six and ninemonths ending the day at 9-9/16 7/16 pct and 9-1/2 3/8 pctrespectively. Eligible bank bill rates showed no change fromlate yesterday with one month at 9-13/16 25/32 pct and threemonths at 9-17/32 15/32 pct. REUTER&#3;
