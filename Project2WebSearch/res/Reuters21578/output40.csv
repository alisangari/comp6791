reut2-020.sgm, IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST, If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in aserious way, Japan investment managers say.    The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollarsecurities, have already sold U.S. Equities.    But "if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happenyesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdrawsignificant funds from U.S. Shares," said Akira Kawakami, deputymanager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd'sinternational investment department.    An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japaneseinvestment in U.S. Bonds. "Japan-U.S. Interest ratedifferentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothingin the absence of dollar stability," said Kawakami.    U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picturefollowing the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effectshould be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.    But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiatingto see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar washolding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.    "Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks inNew York yesterday, most are still looking for chances tolighten their U.S. Stock inventories," Hiromitsu Sunada, managerof Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investmentdepartment said.    Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 pointsto 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.    "Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,considering the dangers," said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy generalmanager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixedincome securities marketing group.    Japanese investment at home could start to pick up oncemarkets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managerssaid. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in oneor two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield forthe 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.    "The basic background which has supported the stocks andbonds markets has not changed," said Norio Okutsu, assistantgeneral manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. "But newoutflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing."  However,this was already evident three months ago, he said. REUTER&#3;

He said the 16.51 pct drop in the exchange's indexreflected a "totally emotional" reaction to Monday's fall on theNew York stock exchange and was not a reflection of a newcrisis for the Mexican economy or the stockmarket."    He was speaking at a news conference here on Monday.    "We think that after the psycological effect the market willtend to stabilize itself," Somoza said.    Somoza said he based his optimism on the relatively brightoutlook of the Mexican economy due to increased income from oiland non-petroleum exports, record high foreign reserves andgovernment efforts to promote a modernization of the industrialsector.    "The U.S. Economy is not the same as the Mexican," he said.He did not say when he thought the market would stabilize.    He said traders had originally expected the market to levelout on Monday after last week's profit taking pulled the indexdown 44,207 points.     News of the "enormous problems" in New York, which reachedMexico City before the local market opened, caused a flurry ofselling on the Mexican exchange, Somoza said.    The stockmarket had risen 629 pct over the year by the endof September.    Somoza said Monday's light volume of 15.3 mln sharescompared to an average of 53 mln was an indication the day'sdrop was not a sign of a major collapse.    He also denied rumours that the day's loss was the resultof government and brokerage house manipulation. REUTER&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS, Asian cocoa producers are expandingoutput despite depressed world prices and they dismisssuggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.    "Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their marketfrom our product," said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorategeneral of plantations. "We're happy about our long-term future."    Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales inAsia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitablefor European tastes.    They were responding to comments by London traders thatlarge tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesiaand Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoaprices.    London traders said the Asian cocoa was consideredunsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and ahigh level of free fatty acids.    Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and theUnited States if it did not produce a type suitable for WesternEurope.    A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said theLondon market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa withhigh-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.    "When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything totalk down prices," the spokesman said.    He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.    PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoayear ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exportedto West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to theNetherlands and Britain.    The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry officialwho wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problemwith quality and would continue to expand sales. He describedcriticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as "trade politics"and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant itdid not have any difficulty with exports.    Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodityproducers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside theInternational Cocoa Organization (ICCO).    Officials have said Malaysian production is expected tototal 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.    This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because ofthe end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largestcocoa growing area.    Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output isprojected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnesthis year as young trees mature.    Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers andtraders said they could last out low prices longer than WestAfrican countries.    According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices wouldhave to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) tomake cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.    Some traders believe the main quality problem is withharvesting and fermentation techniques.    One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtuallyindistinguishable from West African output if treated in thesame way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysianestates. REUTER&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, WILL WORLD RECESSION FOLLOW STOCK MARKET PLUNGE?, Some economists fear a world recession ifstock exchanges continue to plunge. Others are more sanguine.    The pessimists say the stocks shakeout is destroyingpersonal assets and dampening consumption.    "The real economic effects can be significant -- thedestruction of wealth and a deflationary impact on the economy,"said an economist at a U.S. Securities house.    But other economists said such fears were overblown.    "Because of lower appreciation of corporate or personalassets, that much negative impact could be observed (in theU.S.)," said Keikichi Honda, general manager of economicresearch at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.    "But the appreciation of stock prices has not been playingsuch a major role in the entire U.S. Gross national product(GNP)," Honda said.    The pessimists noted that the record fall on Wall Street onMonday was sparked by fears the U.S. Economy is heading for arecession or serious slowdown much earlier than expected.    But the optimists said a dampening effect on consumptiondue to stock market losses was less likely in Japan.    "In Japan the weight of stocks in individuals' total assetsis less than in the U.S., And the total weight of individuals'holdings in the stock market is less, so there will be lessdamage than in the U.S.," said an economist at one of Japan'smajor brokerage houses.    "Japan is taking strong measures to stimulate domesticdemand, so while there could be some impact from the reductionof assets value, it would not be a major impact," said the Bankof Tokyo's Honda.    Optimists also pointed to incipient declines in U.S.Interest rates as a positive sign for the U.S. Economy.    "U.S. Interest rates are coming down so there is a feelingthat interest rates have hit their ceiling, and the U.S.Economy is strong, so there should be no direct impact from thecollapse of share prices," said Toshiaki Kakimoto, Sumitomo BankLtd chief economist.    Some economists suggested that should markets continue toslump, the major industrial nations may have to discusspossible joint lowering of official discount rates.    "Until last week, a discussion of lower rates wasunthinkable, now it's not," said the Japanese brokerage houseeconomist.    "There has been a move from the purely rational to theemotional -- it's a central bankers' nightmare," said theforeign economist. "It will require strong global leadership bypoliticians to snuff out," he said.    However, "previously, the stocks correction was due to fearsof higher interest rates, a possible resurgence of inflationand the depreciation of the dollar," said Nobuyuki Ueda, senioreconomist at the Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd.    "Now some people have an uneasy feeling about the outlook ofthe U.S. Economy," Ueda said.    "If the stock market is a leading indicator of the futuremovement of the economy, this decline will have verysignificant implications for the U.S. Economy," he said.    "If the low levels hold, those who were keeping consumptionhigh because of unrealised gains could curb consumption," saidSalomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd economist Ron Napier. "If the papergains aren't there, people won't spend."    A U.S. Recession could then trigger similar declines inother economies, some economists said.    "I don't know if a possible recession in the U.S. Wouldtrigger a world recession because other nations, such as Japan,are showing good economic performance," LTCB's Ueda said. "But wecan't rule out the possibility because the U.S. Is stillplaying a very dominant role in the world economy." REUTER&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, JAPAN TRIES TO STEM STOCKS DIVE, Government and monetary authorities todaystaged a concerted effort to calm spreading panic on Japanesestock exchanges but market analysts said there were limits totheir ability to succeed.    "The ability of the Big Four (Japanese securities houses)and the Finance Ministry is limited," said Barclays de ZoeteWedd economist Peter Morgan.    Finance Ministry officials asked the big four securitiescompanies this afternoon to help calm panic selling on theTokyo Stock Exchange, ministry officials said.    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo NewsService as saying he was watching the stock market situation.    But he rejected comparisons with the 1929 stock marketcollapse and subsequent recession.    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Tokyo stockmarket should not be gravely affected by downturns in New Yorkand London because there are clear signs of a Japanese economicrecovery and exchange rate stability.    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita also tried to calmthe panic, saying in a statement that world stock markets wereexcessively concerned about the economic future.    Traditionally, the four big houses  -- Nomura Securities CoLtd, Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd, Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, andNikko Securities Co Ltd -- have influenced the market becauseof their sheer size and overwhelming market share.    This strength has in the past made it possible for thebrokerages to calm down markets under guidance from the FinanceMinistry, analysts said.    But the analysts questioned whether the brokerages, whichhave already suffered heavy losses from falling bond marketsover the past year, would have the strength this time to turnthings around.    "The question is, are the Japanese brokerages strong enoughto force investors to buy," said Johsen Takahashi, researchdirector at the Mitsubishi Research Institute.    "If we consider that they have suffered serious losses inthe bond markets and in their U.S. Investments, it is debatablewhether they they could support buying," he said.    "We can support things to some extent, but we can'tcompletely suppress selling," said one Japanese broker.    Some analysts said the high percentage of shares cross-heldby financial institutions and other corporations could have astabilising effect on the market.    Some 80 pct of shares are held by corporate shareholders,said Keikichi Honda, general manager of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd'seconomic research division. "This is a tightly woven textile. Inits own way it is stronger than Wall Street."    But other analysts expressed doubt about this argument.    "If a high percent of shares is cross held, everythinghappens at the edges and the relative moves can be larger," saidKleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. "Sellingwill drive prices down an enormous distance because of noliquidity."    "You don't need big volume to get big declines in the market-- you just need a huge imbalance between sellers and buyers,"said Barclay's Morgan.    Shares held by what are termed "stable shareholders," orbanks and other companies with which a firm does business,might also find their way onto the market if the outlook getsbad enough, some analsyst said.    "Closely held shares could become unclosely held," saidMorgan. But he said such a prospect is unlikely right nowbecause companies, with their improved earnings prospects, donot need to sell shares for cash flow reasons. REUTER&#3;

But in an address to a conference of the IndonesianPetroleum Association, he said, "If worst comes to worst and saythe flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completelyshut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,can take care of the situation."    "But this is not to say that prices, at least for a shortduration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage ofthe situation," he declared.    Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relativelyshort-term impact on prices, he added.    Assessing future price trends, he said, "Short-term spotprices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likelyhover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs perbarrel.    "The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greaterthan the downward ones."    "The balance between supply and demand in the short termwill still be delicate," he added. "Non-Opec production may stillgo up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increasein world demand."    Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee whichhas been touring cartel members, said speculation may playhavoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize thesituation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.    In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach aplateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, hesaid. REUTER&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, POEHL SAYS RATE RISES ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN, Rises in West German and internationalinterest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank hasno interest in higher capital market rates, BundesbankPresident Karl Otto Poehl said.    "We consider the interest rate increase that has occurredhere and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,"Poehl told an investment conference.    "I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interestin higher capital market rates," he said.    Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced atender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80pct.    Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate haveseen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pctat last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender inlate September.    The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injectionsof money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.    These moves to cap interest rates followed a meetingbetween Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.    Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmedtheir commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening inWest German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of thedollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.    But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting innervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.    Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was notdue to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, andcurrency developments.    Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said "Youhave to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue apolicy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears." The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, hesaid.    Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution tointernational cooperation in interest and monetary policy.    The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its moneysupply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.    "Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interestrates have risen substantially more," Poehl said.    This had to be taken into account when considering recentrises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due torising international money market rates that had spilled overinto the German market, he said.    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so farignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.    "The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance isdefinitely underway," he said, noting that this was not sonoticeable in absolute figures.    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had alsoattracted little attention, he said. REUTER&#3;

The bill, which was defeated by the Senate AgricultureCommittee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a yearin lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.    "Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance thebill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to anotherSenate bill," a spokesman for the United Coconut Association ofthe Philippines (UCAP).    PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, witheight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.    The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association(ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.    He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue duringthe debate.    "Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturatedanimal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systemsleaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease," he said.    U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued thatsaturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels woulddiscourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favourof domestic unsaturated alternatives.    Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminatedagainst imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia andIndonesia.    The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut productsin 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.    Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible useaccount for about half of that total, PCA's Romero said. REUTER&#3;

Brokers said the Securities Exchange of Thailand Index fella record 36.64 points, or nearly eight pct, to close at 422.37.    "It's impossible to halt the slide in this situation. Themarket just doesn't behave logically," said SirivatVoravetvuthikun, executive vice president of Asian SecuritiesTrading Co Ltd.    But Sirivat said he did not believe the fall would mark theend of the SET's 16 month bull run, which has acceleratedduring the last two months. He expected Thai stocks tofluctuate widely in the next few weeks.    The slide on Tuesday followed a 13.85 point decline of the97-stock index on Monday when it closed at 459.01.    Brokers said they were flooded with sell orders when themarket opened this morning and a SET announcement urginginvestors not to panic was ignored.    The index reached a record 472.86 last Friday, up 57.7 pctfrom end-June and 128.2 pct higher than last December.    SET officials said 77 issues were traded on Tuesday, ofwhich all but two declined. Of the losers, 68 plummeted thedaily maximum 10 pct allowed by the exchange. Prices on thespecial foreign column also fell sharply.

reut2-020.sgm, TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY, Plunging Tokyo stock prices will preventthe Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could evenforce it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,government and private economists said.    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to sparkfurther selling of shares that could ultimately have a majordeflationary impact on the real economy, they said.    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistentlymaintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discountrate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.     Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by thecentral bank's apparent decision last week to countenancehigher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed toraise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about arenewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as themarkets concluded that the stock market's collapse precludedthe central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discountrate increase.    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent afurther drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. "They need tosupport the stock and security markets," he said.    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to changepolicy for the moment, although one admitted that the centralbank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock pricescontinue to plunge during the rest of the week.    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed theeconomy is better placed now to cope with the deflationaryimpact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop instock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer andbusiness confidence, one government economist said.    "There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won'tbe that big," said another.    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on theirown, although they do participate through trust funds and otherinvestment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turnedto financial market investments for profits during last year'seconomic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them torefocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that ispartly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies haveshifted funds away from financial investments to increaseinventories and step up capital spending, one governmenteconomist said.    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock pricedrop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether priceswill continue to fall further and then decide if they pose agreater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,one central bank official said. "That will at least take acouple of days, if not weeks," he said. REUTER&#3;

In a speech to 13 major business groups, Aquino said, "Ourpolicy has been very clear fm the start -- growth must takepriority, for the plain and simple reason that if we have nomoney to pay, we can't. And if we starve the nation ofessential services, there may be no one around to honour thedebt."    Aquino said her officials would try to get all 483 creditorbanks to sign the debt rescheduling pact by the November 15effective date.    "That should end speculation and remove at least one excusefor hoarding dollars," Aquino said.    Violent fluctuations in the peso's exchange rate and theend of a 17-month bull run in local stock markets havetriggered dollar-hoarding.    Aquino said the country's foreign debt, which rose tonearly 29 billion dlrs in April, was growing even without freshborrowing.    Debt servicing took up 40 pct of the budget and 45 pct ofexport earnings, Aquino said. Over the next six years, thePhilippines would be paying its creditors 20 billion dlrs whilegetting only four billion dlrs in new loans.    Aquino acknowledged there were grave doubts about hergovernment's ambitious privatisation program.

Representatives of the U.S., The Soviet Union, the EuropeanCommunity and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionarythermonuclear reactor, to produce energy not from splittingatoms as in today's nuclear plants, but by joining them.    Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for PlasmaPhysics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich, West Germany,and is scheduled for completion by 1990, an IAEA statementsaid.    Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has beenunder way for many years but the project approved on Monday,known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor(ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built.    The project represents an unprecedented display ofEast-West scientific cooperation, but a decision will not bemade until its completion on whether an actual reactor would bejointly constructed or by individual participant countries.    Dieter Sigmar, a leading U.S. Fusion researcher, said lastmonth that the development of a demonstration plant would costseveral billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years.    Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste.    While today's nuclear power plants need uranium, mined inonly a few countries and producing dangerous waste, fusionplants would eventually run only on deuterium, an elementrelated to hydrogen and available from almost limitlesssupplies of sea water, according to experts.

Takeshita told a news conference on Tuesday that he woulddo his best to continue the domestic reforms and externalpolicies of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.    However, leading Japanese businessmen called on Takeshitato outdo Nakasone by showing stronger leadership.    "Takeshita should not merely follow the Nakasone policiesbut should cope with mounting economic issues with a new visionand policies," Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committeefor Economic Development, said in a statement.    Economists generally agreed that there will be no majorchanges in Japan's economic policies under a new leader.    However, expectations are high among major industries fornew initiatives by Takeshita for immediate and effectivemeasures to solve economic problems such as trade friction withthe U.S., Administrative and tax reforms, and soaring landprices.    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of EconomicOrganisations (Keidanren), urged Takeshita to succeed inunifying the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as soon aspossible to tackle difficult tasks.    Regarding foreign economic polices, Yoshitoki Chino,chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, saidTakeshita should come up with economic measures well beforeeconomic issues develop into problems.    Behind those calls on Takeshita for prompt action aredoubts about his capability in handling international issuesdue to his lack of experience in diplomacy, economists said.     Economists said foreign countries should be patient withTakeshita, who is widely known as an ultra-cautious politician.    Takeshita has repeatedly said, "There should be consensusbefore taking action."    Takeshita has so far failed to unveil specific measures toreduce Japan's huge trade surplus, economists said.

"The Japanese Government is depending on the sale of NTT(Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp &lt;NCCT.T>) shares for muchof its public spending budget," said Shigeo Suzuki, a deputygeneral manager at the Industrial Bank of Japan.    Japan had hoped to raise at least 5,000 billion yen fromthe sale of 1.95 mln NTT shares on November 10.    However, the 14.9 pct plunge in the Tokyo share index todayhas made such plans look unrealistic, analysts said.    "The government could defer the sale of NTT or they couldoffer fewer shares," said Keikichi Honda, general manager ofeconomic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.    Honda said another possibility is that the underwritershandling the NTT sale would have to pay the Government theamount it expected to get and bear the brunt of any lossesthemselves. "That is what underwriting means," he added.    A Finance Ministry official confirmed that the governmentplanned to go ahead with its sale of NTT shares on November 10.    Another possible effect of Tokyo's stock tumble would be toseriously undermine the asset base of Japanese banks.    The banks lend money all over the world and regard themarket value of stock holdings as assets, analysts said.    "Japanese banks make loans using perhaps as much as 60 to 70pct of the market value of their unrealised stock holdings asassets," said Industrial Bank's Suzuki.    There is also concern that Japanese companies, which haveinvested heavily in Tokyo's stocks as their real businessdeclined over the last two years, have sustained heavy losses.    "Many companies, mainly export-oriented companies, wereplanning on selling their shares for a profit to reinvest inreal businesses as the economy begins to pick up," said oneanalyst at a foreign brokerage. "That prospect now looks dim."    But analysts said it is unlikely companies or financialinstitutions will be bankrupted by losses in stock trading.    "I don't think any company is so badly exposed in stockinvestments," said a senior analyst at Nomura ResearchInstitute. "In terms of financial institutions, luckily therebounding bond market and currency markets are stillprofitable," he added.    The Nomura analyst said a 10 pct decline in Tokyo stockswould be translated into a fall of about 0.2 pct in consumerspending. Some 20 pct of Tokyo stocks are owned by individuals.    Market capitalisation on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to329,588 billion yen on Tuesday from 386,041 billion at Monday'sclose.

The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.    "Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300metres within the Baong formation," he said.    He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flowoil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.    "The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mlnstandard cubic feet a day," he added.

reut2-020.sgm, INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS, Indonesia told the oil industry onTuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks andimprove the investment climate, but wants to see increasedexpenditure on exploration in return.    President Suharto, in an opening speech to the IndonesianPetroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extendcontracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.    "In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, thegovernment of Indonesia has basically approved of extendingproduction sharing contracts under the present laws," Suhartosaid.    "Apart from that, the government will keep improving theinvestment climate in order to accelerate the development ofthe petroleum industry," he said.    Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association hewas aware that the oil industry needed to be assured thatcontracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would berenewed before they would invest in further exploration.    "As we all have heard this morning, the President is fullyaware of this situation," Subroto said.    "The government has already made the political decision toentertain this time problem by inviting the existing producersto continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on aselective basis."    Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oilreserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oilindustry sources say.    Subroto said the government was also working to ease otherproblems, including granting easier terms for remote areas ordeep water conditions.    But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-wayand that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration nowthat the oil price had recovered.    President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer oftechnology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oilindustry for the regions in which companies operated.    Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil companyPertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and productionexpenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast tofall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in1986.    Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operationcontracts with foreign oil companies.    Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for fieldoperations was a government priority. There had beenmisunderstandings between the government and the oil industryin certain areas, such as when a field is designatedcommercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.    He said the government wanted to finalise contractextensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in themeantime to maintain its exploration drive.    Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintainexploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expirewithin 10 years. "This need in itself is some sort of guaranteethat we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement."    Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewalbetween 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.    Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involveddetailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.    Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensionswould be selective, based on how much capital would beinvested. REUTER&#3;

REPUTATION - OFFICIALS, Stockbrokers and legislators welcomedthe suspension of trading on the local market after Monday'srecord fall, but some said the suspension was too long andcould harm the territory's reputation as a financial centre.    Announcing the suspension until next Monday, stock exchangechairman Ronald Li said earlier today "This will protectinvestors and allow brokers to settle a backlog of orders."    But legislator David Li, who is also managing director ofthe Bank of East Asia, while weloming the move, said a one-dayhalt would have been enough.    "I believe the exchange is over-reacting. A long suspensionwill damage Hong Kong's reputation as a financial centre andhurt foreign investors' confidence," David Li said.    Legislator Hui Yin-fat echoed this view. "What will they doif the market resumes its fall next week ?" he asked.    Legislator Lee Yu-tai said small investors would behard-hit by the decision. He said some were paying interest onloans to purchase stock and a long suspension increased theirlosses.    Financial Secretary Piers Jacobs said the decision wasexplainable, but he added, "It does seem rather a long time."    However, George Tan, assistant director of GreenwellMontagu (Far East) Ltd, said the suspension was wise. "Hong Kongis a volatile market and this will let things settle down," hesaid.    Other brokers agreed. "At least this gives us a bit ofbreathing space," said one.

The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four Americandestroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours afterthe attack, he said.

Washington has said the attack was in response toa missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea IsleCity in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.    He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs"except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence." Reacting toWeinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,Aqazadeh said: "Iran will also consider the case closed afterits retaliatory measure." Iranian officials have said theirresponse would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interestsaround the world might come under attack.

reut2-020.sgm, U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED, A voluntary compliance system formonitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewedskeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts andtrade sources.    "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because ofthe past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as itbecame a matter of the trade monitoring each other," oneanalyst said.    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter saidthe Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement avoluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation tomonitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffeeimporters would voluntarily present needed documents to theU.S. government until Congress approves the monitoringauthority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,it will still be allowed entry.    While many believe producers will not seek to add to theoverburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe somewill ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu ofmonitoring controls, trade sources said.    "Last time, there was a lot of false information submittedto customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," aU.S. Customs spokesman said.    "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but whenits hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demandForm O (documents tracking merchandise from source todestination)," he said.    Many see it as a true test of whether producers andimporters will abide by the quota system.    "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in thequota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.     "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade didnot act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "withoutthe need to submit documents, the ball will be in theproducers' hands."    Some feel that importers will take advantage of thevoluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-membercountries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falselylabelled.    According to customs officials, several green coffeeimporters confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffeefraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navybeans.    "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices forone country and another, producers may be teted to get rid oftheir stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and bycircumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analystBernie Savaiko.    Still, others believe that producers will not be hardpressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation inthe U.S. in the near term.    "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would nothave some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary systemseemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have somuch coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of athreat," one trader said.

reut2-020.sgm, WHITE HOUSE SEES 163 BILLION DLR BUDGET DEFICIT, The White House said the federalbudget deficit for fiscal 1988 will total 163 billion dlrs ifCongress and the administration fail to agree on a legislativepackage of deficit reduction measures prior to a Nov. 20deadline.    In a report issued under the requirements of new balancedbudget legislation approved by Congress in September, the WhiteHouse budget office predicted the government would take in 903billion dlrs in revenues and spend 1.066 trillion during fiscal1988, which began Oct. 1.    Under the terms of the new law, the government's failure toagree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 20 would triggeracross-the-board spending cuts of 23 billion dlrs.    The White House report said this would reduce those defensespending programs covered by the legislation by 10.5 pct andwould cut domestic programs by 8.5 pct.    This magnitude of reductions would shear 11.5 billion dlrsfrom defense and 11.5 billion dlrs from domestic programs.    The Congressional budget Office last week estimated the1988 budget deficit at 179.3 billion dlrs. Reuter&#3;

EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops.

reut2-020.sgm, NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG, The Soviets have not indicated anurgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikelythat such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summitexpected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng told Reuters.    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he didnot know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheatsubsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.    "Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me thatthere's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (awheat subsidy)."    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Sovietsummit, Lyng said, "No, I don't think so. I don't think that."    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal toMoscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate fordiscussion at a summit.    "It would not be the kind of issue that the President or theChairman would get into specific negotiations or discussionsabout," Lyng said.    "When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary foragriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat wasnot something that would be discussed with the President of theUnited States. He said it's not presidential," Lyng said.    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some majorproducing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and thestill unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any finaldecision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreementwill be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but theAgriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of thelong-standing agreement.    "We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets havefailed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We wouldlove to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.These are some of the questions we need to discuss."    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted fromthe agreement, Lyng said, "I don't know. It certainly hasn'tbeen what we had hoped it would be. For three years runningthey've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was anagreement." Reuter&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, LYNG SAYS INDIA FOOD AID PACKAGE NOT READY, The United States and India havenot yet agreed on a food aid package to help thedrought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said.    Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countrieshave been discussing a package but that he did not expect thespecifics of the offer to be announced during Indian PrimeMinister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.    "We have been talking about the potential needs that Indiamight have for both their commercial market and purchases needsas well as the possibilities of assistance," Lyng said.    "At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. Theamounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we haveindicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist inwhatever way they deem most valuable," he said.    There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA wouldoffer India subsidized vegetable oil under the exportenhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419of an amended 1949 law.    Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agreeon the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and thatWashington would prefer the package include something otherthan donated food.    "The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking careof themselves. India is a country that has come a long way inits ability to produce food and they have a great pride inthat," Lyng said.    "We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses westill have of many commodities..., would like to share in theimport business the Indians do, and then we have some, as wealways do, compassion for the people of India and would like tocooperate with them," he said.    Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officialsduring Gandhi's visit here, adding, "I just don't know ofanything that might be announced specifically."    Asked if "the ball was in the Indians' court," he said, "Yes."    Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening. Reuter&#3;

Income is expected to rise 11.6 mln francs to 27.22billion, while expenditure is seen increasing 7.1 mln to 25.95billion next year. After internal transfers, net income wasplanned to total 637 mln francs.    The ministry also announced that higher than expectedincome during 1987 would likely boost this year's surplussignificantly higher than the 171 mln francs budgeted.    The ministry said the encouraging development ofSwitzerland's finances was due to steady economic growth since1983 and the government's conservative fiscal policy.    Although the dollar's weakness is likely to dampen economicgrowth slightly in 1988 by depressing exports, domesticinvestment and consumer demand were expected to remain strong.    Real gross national product growth was seen rising two pct,while annual inflation was also projected to reach two pct. REUTER&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS, U.S. And West German reaffirmation ofsupport for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamentalproblems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind thecurrent collapse in stock markets, London economists said.    "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that thedollar is going to be allowed to slip," said Richard Jeffrey ofHoare Govett. "If not, there is going to be continued fear thatwhen pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced totighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in theU.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world."    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, whichdragged other major markets down with it, may help curb thevery problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflationfears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.    "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," saidGeoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments fromother London and Tokyo analysts.    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears offurther falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationarypressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist theequity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.    "It would be suicidal for any government in the context ofwhat happened in the last couple of days to jack up theirinterest rates," he added.    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its primelending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fedchairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financialsystem.    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stockcollapse would spill over into the economy, via a bankingcrisis for example, thus precipitating recession.    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists saidtoday's whiplash moves do not have long term significance andthat markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals inmind.    "The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economicgrowth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides amore realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said Capel'sDennis. But he added that markets are still very much indanger.    "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing isdisappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted.    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said worldmarket turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,as implied by West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currenciesis still on.    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered byexpectations that the Germans were more worried about the moneysupply impact of such intervention than maintaining currencystability.    But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, saidMorrison. "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. Tostabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA, An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stgsurge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely tonudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy aslong as sterling remains in its present robust state,economists said.    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over thepast two days will in any case subdue personal consumer creditdemand which has largely been behind growth in lending.    "In the normal course of events the markets would have beenextremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K.Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,which compared won stg August rise, U.K.Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to fleefrom plummetting equities into the relative security ofgovernment securities.    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching aday's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tonethroughout.    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morningafter little more than a token blip as the figures came out.    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by bankswould under other circumstances have prompted market fears of arise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "Withthe financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the lastthing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said.    "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long assterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell MontaguGilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow moneymeasure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pctgrowth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.    But "The fact that overall broad money growth has sloweddown is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K.Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to afall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad moneyaggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bankof England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base ratesto 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently bynews of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry inthat period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets ininfluencing consumer behaviour, he said.    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equitymarkets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be astraightforward impact on consumer spending and on retailsales," Temperton said.    "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth inconsumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added.    "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lendingfigure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a veryserious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said.    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to lookat all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowlythan bank lending.    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lendingwas evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavypersonal sector borrowing.    Figures from the Banking Information Service showedpersonal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Muchof the rise reflected quarterly interest payments. REUTER&#3;

He declined to elaborate.    A senior bank official, who declined to be named, toldReuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs atthe end of the year.

Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output atseveral of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production atfields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk fieldrescue project.    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway'svoluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oiloutput, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabiliseoil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend theproduction restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on allits North Sea fields for the rest of the year.    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norwaywould extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, whichpumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which usethe Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August whilePhillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ulafield, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after droppingto 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpdlast month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the companysaid.    September production was also sharply higher at theStatfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, whichextends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpdagainst 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske StatsOljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, likeStatfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpdin September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previousmonth, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpdin September, compared with 100,188 in August.    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said testoutput at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarltotalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd inAugust.    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring onstream a second well, cutting September production to just twodays. REUTER&#3;

The BMA's quarterly statistical bulletin gave no reason forthe sharp rise, but economists said banks appeared to bestaying liquid because of the escalation of the Gulf crisis.They said banks are parking funds in interbank markets outsideBahrain.    Despite the rise in assets, banks in Bahrain have beenretrenching operations considerably. At the end of 1986 therewere 68 OBUs compared with 74 at the end of 1985.

The mid-1987 figure was thehighest since early 1985 when assets topped 61 billion.    The second quarter rise came almost entirely in OBU assetsoutside Bahrain.

Tribune reported net income of 33,085,000 dlrs or 42 cts ashare, down from 123,450,000 dlrs or 1.53 dlrs in the 1986third quarter.

After adjusting for these extraordinary items, TribunePresident Stanton Cook said 1987 year-end should be strong.    "Overall, we expect Tribune company's earnings beforenon-recurring factors to show solid improvement for 1987," Cooksaid.

Last year Avon earned 158.7 mln dlrs or 2.23 dlrs a shareon sales of 2.9 billion dlrs.

reut2-020.sgm, LYNG PLEASED EC TO OFFER GATT FARM PROPOSAL, U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer aglobal farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although theUnited States opposes key parts of the proposal.    "We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.It will help us in getting the negotiations underway," Lyngtold Reuters in an interview Tuesday.    Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourgendorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguayround agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.    Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the planseeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposingcurbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.    The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of allfarm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and haspressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reachinga global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.    However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said theReagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies isunrealistic.    Asked about such criticism, Lyng said "The alternative todoing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. Ithink that is the unrealistic position."    "I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we aretrying to say."    Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree afreeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started.    "All that some countries would like to have would be awheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.That doesn't do a thing for us," Lyng said.    The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range ofagricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, hesaid.    At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada isexpected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.    The United States will be represented at the meeting byformer agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recentlyappointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture. Reuter&#3;

Jim Perkins, group vice president for sales and marketingfor Toyota's U.S. sales subsidiary, told reporters Toyota'sexpected decline will come principally in the truck segmentwhere the company faces intense competition from U.S. domesticmanufacturers such as Ford Motor Co &lt;F>.    Toyota, he said, also expects to stress sales in the lowand middle segments of the car market to remain competitive.    Asked if Toyota's U.S. profits could show a substantialdecline with its lower trucks sales in the next two years, heresponded "conceivably it could," but added, "Our plan is notto chase this thing to where it makes no economic sense."    Perkins also predicted that the 1988 U.S. vehicle marketcould fall below 15 mln sales from above 15 mln expected thisyear. He expects some smaller Japanese automakers could beforced to withdraw from the U.S. market or to seek partnershipswith one another in the face of intense competition.     The Toyota executive said the collapse of U.S. stockprices and any further weakening of the dollar would likelyhave "a very quick impact on the Japanese (car) companies."    "In our company, when the stock market goes down, we see itvery soon in the New York metropolitan car market. New York isthe best indicator of what's going to happen in the rest of ofthe country. I can tell you from the next 15 days (of carsales) in the New York market what it will be in the rest ofthe country in the next six months," Perkins said.     The Toyota executive said the panic selloff in the NewYork Stock Exchange hurts the car market because "it doescreate a shock wave of doubt in the minds of consumers."     He said Toyota would wait at least 30 to 60 days to assessthe impact of the the stock market drop on the wider economybefore making any changes in its basic business plan for theU.S. market.    Toyota, he said, expects its 1988 U.S. sales will total atleast 600,000 cars and 275,000 trucks compared with about630,000 cars and 300,000 trucks expected for 1987, and 644,000cars and 388,000 trucks sold in 1986.    He said Toyota hopes it will be able to import 610,000 carsfrom Japan in 1988, the same as its 1987 allocation underTokyo's voluntary export restraint scheme.    But he said it was uncertain if Toyota would keep itscurrent allocation becuase of pressures on Japan's Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry to roll back Japanese carexport quotas from the current 2.3 mln annualized rate.

Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference onTuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanismfor cereal substitutes.    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with theDanish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chairmeetings of their EC colleagues.    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would helpthe EC's budget problems and would provide some price stabilityfor producers.    This would in turn help the market position for certaincrops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peasand beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severeoutput restrictions.    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats taxon imported and domestically produced oils and marine fatssucceeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual ECprice fixing.    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains itsproposals for a tax.    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursueinternational negotiations on farm trade with the aim ofbridging the gap between EC and world prices. Reuter&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, GATT CASE AGAINST JAPAN A MODEL FOR U.S. - LYNG, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngsaid the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaintagainst Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance innegotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.    The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japanend quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by theend of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling willfavor the U.S.    "These are quota items, and the principles that apply tothem, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question ofwhether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus," Lyngtold Reuters in an interview.    He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas onbeef and citrus after March 31, next year.    The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the UnitedStates has challenged include items such as tomato paste, somecheeses and specialty fruit juices.    U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas wouldbe issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision hasbeen delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.    The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrusquotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protectJapanese farmers.    "We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (onbeef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that anillegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.    He declined to say what action the U.S. would take nextApril if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.    Reuter&#3;

The world economy was growing and dangers of inflation werebeing held in check. The recent International Monetary Fund andWorld meetings confirmed the positive forecasts for globaleconomic development.    Therefore, there were no rational reasons for a sharptightening of monetary policy nor for a continued rise ininterest rates, Roeller said.    "This applies in particular to West Germany," he said.    As a result, Roeller expected the markets to calm. Theywould not ignore long-term economic factors.

reut2-020.sgm, ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT, The American Soybean Association (ASA)denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegalunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, andthreatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does notremedy the situation.    ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsoredOutlook 87 conference: "It will be filed unless the EC takesdrastic and immediate steps."    "These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,since they were established after the zero soybean duty wasestablished in 1962," he said.    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would askfor an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies tomake the regime non-discriminatory.    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, inan effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds productionhas risen dramatically since then.    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above worldmarket levels and is considering implementing a controversialoils and fats tax.    The subsidies "are obvious attempts to circumvent the zeroduty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell," Adamssaid.    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support itstrade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes anEC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in theEC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct involume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result ofEC policies, Adams added.    Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker atthe conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products. Reuter&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES, The United States is prepared to "pull outall the stops" to defend its agricultural trade rights under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassadorto GATT Michael Samuels said.    Those rights are now being challenged by the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told aconference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate ifthe EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef withoutthe issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effecton January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meatshipments into the EC.    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseedprices over the current market level and which may be extendedto include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral tradenegotiations, "is meaningless if import barriers continue to beerected," Samuels said.    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farmsubsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, "visionary"and "very serious."  The EC and Japan have said it isunrealistic.    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposalon farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formallynext week.    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reducetensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cerealssubstitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction offarm subsidies.    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long asthey are directly linked to long-term commitments to end majortrade distortions, Samuels said.    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formallysubmitted and respond to it officially then.    "We will consider its relation to the Punta del Estedeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"the U.S. Ambassador said.    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignoresthe U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.    The key difference between the two approaches is that theU.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushingonly for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,there would be little incentive for the Community to work tocorrect the international trade situation, he added.    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the ECoilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports tothird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which theU.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

reut2-020.sgm, BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE, The United States appears to have won atransatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interestrates, European economists said.    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testingthe limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets wereplunging.    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment tocurrency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,according to official statements released late Monday.    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, theBundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banksliquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pctfacility rate offered last week.    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbankpresident Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also addedmoney market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want astrong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.     "It's round one to the Americans, " said Richard Reid,senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew inLondon.    But Reid added, "We shouldn't forget that it has taken oneof the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the WestGermans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05percentage point."    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tighteningof West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall andfuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February'sLouvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetarypolicies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency marketsand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours tradingin New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar wasquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at DeutscheGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on worldstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in WestGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday.    "The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock marketlosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fitswith Baker's wishes, then all the better," he said.    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and theBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following risesin the U.S., Aschoff said.    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the centralbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and hethought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First BostonLtd in London said "The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreatand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as thesecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it wasbefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington."    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord wasreaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidityat 3.60 pct, Keating noted.    Economists said the United States now appeared to haveagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and supportthe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinderWashington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenbergtold a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not ruleout central banks of leading industrial countries interveningon exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed WestGermany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currencystability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German centralbanks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force themto again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar. REUTER&#3;

"We expect that the Texas Supreme Court will hear our case,will heed the voices of impartial third parties and willultimately reverse this unjust decision and thus provide thesimple basic justice that Texaco has asked for all along,"DeCrane said in a speech at a meeting of the InternationalAssociation of Drilling Contractors.    DeCrane said he expected the Texas State Supreme Court tooverturn a State Appeals Court ruling that found Texacounlawfully interfered with Pennzoil's 1984 plan to acquireGetty Oil.    "This case has become much more than a quarrel between twocompanies," DeCrane said. "It presents a far broader threat toour economic system and to justice in America as we know ittoday."       Settlement talks between the two oil companies to resolvethe billion dlr lawsuit reportedly stalled earlier this yearwhen the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a friendof the court brief in support of Texaco.    The agency claimed Pennzoil violated SEC rule 10B-13 whichprohibits the purchase of shares privately at the same time atender offer is outstanding.    DeCrane also said concerns expressed by 19 state attorneysgeneral in the legal proceedings also favored Texaco'sposition.    "The bottom line is that the SEC had intervened to insurethat its rule are interpreted properly in the interest ofmillions of private stockholders around the country who mightsome day find themselves the victim of this same kind ofmanipulation," DeCrane told the oilmen.    He warned that if the state appeals court judgment wasupheld in Pennzoil's favor, it would "send out of statebusinesses fleeing from Texas in droves."    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.bankruptcy code last April after a state appeals court upheldPennzoil's 10.3 billion dlr judgment.       Texaco's appeal of the decision to the Texas State SupremeCourt has been pending for several weeks and the court isexpected to decide soon whether it will agree to review thelower court ruling.    If the Texas State Supreme Court does not hear the case,Texaco has said it will take its case to the U.S. SupremeCourt. Reuter&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA, The European Community (EC) agreed atrade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the countryfollowing the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, ECofficials said.    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentinawill gain additional trading rights on a series of productsincluding meat, fish and cereals by-products.    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals withCanada and Japan and are due to study these again, theofficials said.    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of ECstates after West Germany withdrew objections to increasedquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,saying that the main dispute was over sales of cerealssubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, theofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade).    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership.    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on thefish dispute with Canada.    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The ECclaims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group hasimproved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfiedwith Japanese offers of compensation.    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems oncitrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for someother farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwearand to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq toldjournalists: "We maintain our position that the (Japanese)concessions were not enough."    "We hope that there will be an improvement," he said.

reut2-020.sgm, DEN NORSKE CREDITBANK LOAN LOSS CUT HELPS NET, Den Norske Creditbank (DNC) &lt;NCBO.OL>,Norway's biggest commercial bank, said it boosted its profitsin 1987's first eight months by 32.3 pct after vigorouslycutting loan losses and operating costs.    The bank showed a 300 mln crown net profit after provisionsfor losses and taxes in the period ending on August 31, againsta 203 mln crown profit in the same year-ago period, it said.    DNC's biggest gains were seen in the domestic market, butsome of its foreign exchange and securities units have been hitby sharply higher interest rates for the dollar and resultsremained unsatisfactory, it added.    Total assets rose to 132 billion crowns from 107.6 billion.    Although the group's operating profit dropped to 875 mlncrowns compared with 986 mln a year-ago, the loss was counteredby reducing the need to set aside capital to cover loan losses,it added.    "In 1986 DNC made substantial provisions for potential loanlosses, particularly in the oil and shipping sectors...The needfor write-offs in these sectors has now been substantiallyreduced," the bank said.    DNC, with extensive exposure in the oil industry, was hardhit by plunging crude prices last year. REUTER&#3;

Net income per common share rose to 2.73 dlrs from 2.29dlrs.    Manufacturers Hanover said it raised common shareholders'equity at the end of the third quarter from the second quarterby 347 mln dlrs, to 2.09 billion dlrs. Included in the increasewas 267 mln dlrs from the sale last month of 6.9 mln new sharesof the corporation's common stock, and 76 mln dlrs fromretained earnings.       Primary capital grew to 6.2 billion dlrs, or 7.92 pct oftotal assets, up from 5.3 billion dlrs, or 7.07 pct, a yearearlier.    Provisions for possible loans losses in the third quarterwas 111.9 mln dlrs, down from 139.5 mln a year ago. The reservefor loan losses stood at 4.78 pct of total loans at the end ofSeptember, up from 1.72 pct a year earlier.    "We have placed top priority on the restoration ofshareholders' equity in the shortest time frame possible," saidJohn McGillicuddy, chairman and chief executive.    "The first step was selling the full amount of new commonequity we anticipate needing in this replenishment process,"McGillicuddy added. "The remainder will come from higher coreearnings, the sale of undervalued, non-strategic assets and therecognition of tax benefits."    Taken together, he said, these moves, as well as tightercontrol over asset levels, will raise the corporation's commonequity-to-assets ratio to the four-pct range by the end of1988. The ratio was 2.77 pct on September 30.    For the nine months, Manufacturers reported a net loss of1.16 billion dlrs, down from a gain of 301.8 mln a year ago.    On a per-share basis, the loss was 28.33 dlrs, down from again of 6.42 dlrs.    The nine-month results reflect the impact of a previouslyannounced decision last quarter to boost the corporation'sloan-loss reserves by 1.7 billion dlrs. Without the addition,net income would have been 263.3 mln dlrs, or 5.41 a share.    Net interest revenue on a taxable equivalent basis in thethird quarter was 494.2 mln dlrs, down from 546.4 mln.

reut2-020.sgm, STOCK TUMBLE MAY SCARE RETIREES OUT OR MARKET, Many Florida investors are old enough tohave seen it all before -- they lived through the Crash of '29and Monday's stock market debacle was just another day forsome.    "I don't sell," declared one elderly investor, who said hehad more than one mln dlrs in stocks. "Whatever goes down isbound to come back up."    The uniqueness of south Florida investors was easy to seein brokerage offices around Miami, where the average age of thecrowds watching the Big Board quotations flash by on Tuesdaywas retirement and beyond.       "I don't know of any demographic studies, but we certainlyhave the highest number of elderly active investors," saidMarshall Moore, a vice president of AmeriFirst SecuritiesCorporation in Miami.    He worries that Monday's record loss of more than 500points on the New York Stock Exchange will scare many people,particularly those on fixed incomes, out of the market forever.    "They will not be in stocks any longer," he said. "When youstart getting heart palpitations and sweaty palms you have toget out and stay out except for maybe utilities and someincome-oriented issues."       Across the state on the Gulf coast where there are heavyconcentrations of retired persons, Robert Lee of InvestmentManagement and Research Incorporated said there were "a lot ofserious losses out there."    Retirees account for 90 per cent of his firm's business andcould take comfort in the fact that its professional managerstook their money out of the market last month. "But for thosewho were buying in on the recent  upswing, this is devastating,"he said.       Miami Beach broker George Fox, most of whose clients areover 60, worries that many are not taking the situationseriously enough. Those who depend on their market earningsshould be a lot more concerned, he said. "I am scared because Ithink this could become very serious."    One 93-year-old investor said the market was bound to fallsharply, "I just didn't think it would happen so soon." Sheremembered '29 and said she remained stingy to this day as aresult.

This is down from the 16.1 mln U.S. built vehicles solddomestically last year, he added.    Despite the sell-off in world stock markets, Petersen said,the underlying fundamentals in the private sector of the U.S.economy remain strong so calendar 1988 vehicle sales shouldequal the 1987 total.       Petersen said he could not explain nor predict stock marketactivity.    But he called for government officials to seriously addresslong-term problems such as the trade and budget deficits,stating the dollar is still too strong relative to other majorcurrencies.    For example, he said, the dollar should be about 120 yencurrently instead of its present level just below 144 yen.       Petersen said Ford plans to spend substantially more in thenext five years than the 15.9 billion dlrs spent in the lastfive on new products and upgrading of its manufacturingoperations.    In 1986, Ford spent 3.4 billion dlrs to upgrade vehiclemanufacturing plants, he noted.    He also said growth in free world car and truck sales willbe 1.8 pct per year over the next 10 years.    Worldwide over-capacity, which was about 2.7 mln units in1985, could expand to nine mln units by 1990, with more thanfive mln of those units in North America, Petersen said.        Reuter&#3;

However, DeCrane refused to say whether the two companieswere holding any settlement negotiations.

DeCrane declined to say whether Texaco and Pennzoil hadheld any recent settlement talks, citing a confidentialityagreement between the two companies.    "A few months ago Texaco offered 100 mln dlrs cash, nostrings attached just to take this appeal to the Texas SupremeCourt," DeCrane said. He was referring to a non-settlementproposal that would have eliminated the threat of Pennzoilfiling liens, or ownership rights, against Texaco propertybefore the company filed for bankruptcy protection in April.    "I think that (the offer) looks pretty good now to aPennzoil shareholder whose stock is trading around 30 or 40."    Settlement talks between the two companies reportedly brokedown earlier this year after Pennzoil insisted it would notsettle for less than four billion dlrs.    Since then, Texaco has asked the Texas State Supreme Courtto review the 10.3 billion dlr judgment against it.

reut2-020.sgm, U.S. SAFETY NETS SHOULD BLOCK 1929-TYPE CRASH, Cascading global stock prices areevoking grim memories of the great market crash of 1929, butanalysts are reminding investors of safeguards in place beforethey stash their savings under the mattress.    But some also say that while banking, securities and sociallaws written during the great depression should prevent arepeat of that dismal era, more protection still might have tobe considered.       And analysts caution that while new laws can deal with someproblems, lawmakers can't legislate away fear--which  helpeddrive the New York Stock Exchange to its record 508-point DowJones index loss on Monday.    That 22.6 percent loss nearly doubled the Oct 29, 1929 loss of 11.7 percent. On the day before that year, the marketfell nearly 13 per cent.    In a series of Reuters interviews with government,congressional and private analysts, most agreed safeguardsexist to avoid a repeat of 1929 and its depression aftermath.    Charles Schultze, chairman of the president's Council ofEconomic Advisers under Jimmy Carter, said in an interview that"the safeguards should be adequate to avoid a repeat of 1929 to1933."    "The safeguards are fine," he said, "The safeguards areadequate to prevent a cascading liquidity failure. That's notthe overall problem which is the dollar and trade deficits."    Schultze, now with the Brookings Institution think-tank,pointed to a weak Federal Reserve during the 1920s when "the Fedacted in the wrong way in 1929--it tightened money."       Similarly, President Reagan's budget manager, James Miller,told Reuters the safeguards in place should be adequate.    And millionaire oilman and business takeover specialist T.Boone Pickens said the present safeguards should avoid any 1929situation.    "It is a much more sophisticated system, I don't see that acomparison is valid."    Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at theconservative American Enterprise Institute, thinks the presentsafeguards will work.       "The main thing is the understanding of the Federal Reserveof its responsibility to maintain liquidity in the economy," hesaid. "There is no reason why this (market fall) needs to spreadinto the real economy. Maybe it's better it happened at all."    Rex Hardesty of the huge labor confederation AFL-CIO saidmany of the present safeguards are not working, saying "onlyone-third of the unemployed are now receiving benefits."    He also called for an increase in the 3.35 dlr minimum wagewhich has not been raised since 1981.    One of the main things that appears different in 1987 thanin 1929 is market psychology, analysts point out.    During those anything goes days of flappers and bathtubgin, the stock market was the road to riches that captured thesavings of shoeshine boys to bank presidents. It was viewed asa highway to heaven with no turning back.    But happy days soon collapsed into a nationwide, hystericalpanic with the stock market crash, wiping out paper millionsand losing the life savings of many average investors as panicset in.    Brokers leaped from Wall Street skyscrapers. American banksclosed for a  "holiday" in 1933 as depositors clamored to pullout their savings. The great depression followed leading intoWorld War II.    Images of those days surfaced with the unprecedented selloff on Monday, but analysts maintained times are different.    House Banking committee specialist Jake Lewis said thatbank investors should have no fears because their savings arenow completely backed by the government.     Even though there have been record bank failures --145 lastyear, 148 this year through today--everyone received theirsavings--unlike the millions lost when banks collapsed 60 yearsago.     Banking deposits, then uninsured, now are fully insured bythe government up to 100,000 dlrs for each saver.    As the depression swept the nation, President FranklinRoosevelt steered into law sweeping banking and securitiesreforms to deal with many of the problems that led to the crashand hurt people afterwards.

The measure, however, does not require President Reagan tocomply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senatebill.

reut2-020.sgm, US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS, U.S. military planners ruled outIran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attackmounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into theIran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform andraided another in what the administration called a "measured andappropriate response" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack lastFriday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rigrather than an onshore economic or military target such asSilkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington tolimit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both athome and in the Gulf.    "It simply demonstrated the United States will take militaryaction when they (Iran) take military action," Norman Polmar, adefense analyst and author, said.    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran theembarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoidingan escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and thepotential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft thatcould have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraqwar, said the United States apparently chose a limited targetto keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept aSecurity Council call for a ceasefire.    "We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's anychance at all," he said, adding that the action made it cleartougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagonto have been turned into a military command post -- Washingtonalso sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran'seconomic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform hadbeen used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in thelower Gulf.    "We have chosen a military target, but we also have shownIran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exportingcapabilities," Cordesman said.    He predicted the United States would respond to any futuremajor Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at BandarAbbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining theapproaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday theUnited States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, "butwe will be prepared to meet any escalation of military actionby Iran with stronger countermeasures."

"I don't think where the market goes over any month longperiod, two day period, or even six month period has anythingto do with our strategy," Gerstner told Reuters.    "We have built a strategy for our company that looks outover many years and anticipates a lot of change," he said.    Gerstner said the company's long term strategy is to buildand maintain a major position in the financial and travelservice industries. American Express is the 69 pct parent ofShearson Lehman Brothers Inc &lt;SHE>.    Gerstner would not comment on the share market tailspin.    However, American Express chairman James Robinson said in astatement that the company could endure the market turbulenceand was in a strong position for further growth.    "All brokerage firms make money if the market goes down orup," Gerstner told Reuters without elaborating.    Gerstner said Shearson had no plans to quit its municipalbond activities. "Shearson Lehman Brothers tends to adjust totrends in incremental steps. You will see it doing less of theconvulsive one-time changes that people in this industry willgo through," he said. Shearson recently laid off 150 people inLondon and is limiting hiring, but Gerstner said AmericanExpress remains committed to the London market and to having aglobal presence.    "That Shearson let a couple of hundred people go in Londonis not even an anthill on the landscape we're discussing. Weare discussing long-term strategy," Gerstner said.    Earlier this year, American Express sold 13 pct of itsstake in Shearson to Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan and afurther 18 pct to the public. Gerstner said these moves "had noimplications of an exit from financial services."    "Our committment globally is represented by the Nippontie-up which dwarfs the fact we decided to reduce the size ofone department, in one company, in one of our subsidiaries," hesaid.    Many securities firms now are stressing merchant banking tobolster earnings hurt by bond market volatility, slow retailbusiness and a drop in underwriting volume.    When asked if more players would make the system morerisky, Gerstner said, "I can't comment on other firms, butShearson is not going to follow a feeding frenzy in thedirection of merchant banking. We are not going to overreach."    Gerstner also spoke about securitization, or therepackaging of debt as marketable securities.    "It is almost imperative to create a security backed by thefunds flowing from an LDC (lessor developed countries) debtprogram. It is going to happen, but it is very difficult tocreate a security in the current climate," Gerstner said.    "Securitized products could be structured for either theretail or institutional markets," Gerstner said.    "If you look at the junk bond phenomenom, it started outwith mostly institutional buyers. Primarily through mutualfunds, individual buyers became a presense in the market. I'dguess we'd see a similiar situation in LDC debt," he said.    "The fundamental thing that has to happen (before there canbe sucessful securitization) is that the debt burden on thecountries has to be reduced, and the amount of money comingfrom the commerical banks and the future call for money oncommercial banks has to be reduced," Gerstner said.

reut2-020.sgm, BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING &lt;V>, The Bank of New York Corp &lt;BK> said itreaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despitethe drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, aBank of New York spokesman said.    "The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer," aBank of New York spokesman said.    Irving would not comment on how the drop in the marketaffects its position on the bid or whether it would buy backany of its own shares.    Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequateand said it wanted to retain its independence.    In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs pershare in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for oneIrving share.    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs pershare for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tenderfor all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop wouldaffect the acquisition.    "If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approveit, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.    "And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"Alpert said.    "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed atpresent. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs ashare, then they won't go at a lower price," another analystsaid.    The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could affordto retain its original offer.    However, industry sources were more uncertain aboutprospects for the deal.    "With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer willlook good to Irving shareholders," said Michael Flores, aconsultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.    The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which isabout a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increasesthe chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likelyto depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the bankingindustry.    "Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't usetheir own stock to make acquisitions because their share priceis too depressed," Alpert said.    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only otherpossible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.    "In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobberedmore than the acquirees," another analyst said. Reuter&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, EC FARM MINISTERS BACK SPENDING CURBS IDEA, European Community (EC) agricultureministers gave their support in principle for a new scheme tolimit spending on the bloc's controversial farm policy at ameeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday, Danish minister LauritsTornaes told journalists.    Acceptance of the scheme, by which farmers would sufferprice cuts if their production exceeded certain norms, known inEC jargon as stabilisers, is seen by diplomats as vital if theEC is to solve its current massive budget crisis.    Speaking at a news conference after chairing a two-daymeeting of farm ministers, Tornaes said: "It is no longer aquestion of whether we are to have stabilisers. It is now aquestion of how we are to implement them."    However, EC sources warned that despite Tornaes' optimism,it may be difficult to get the sort of detailed agreementneeded on the stabiliser scheme ahead of an EC heads ofgovernment meeting in Copenhagen on December 6.    This is the vital meeting at which EC leaders will be askedto agree a new system of EC financing, ending the bloc'shand-to-mouth existence which has resulted in its being unableto agree a budget for 1988.    Britain has said it will block moves to give the ECadditional sources of finance unless a detailed system ofstabilisers is agreed at or ahead of the summit.    Under the most important stabiliser scheme, EC guaranteedprices for cereals would be cut by one percentage point forevery per cent by which the annual harvest exceeded 155 mlntonnes, a figure well below what EC farmers are capable ofproducing in a year of favourable weather conditions.   Farm ministers will meet again on November 16 to attempt tohammer out an accord, and Danish diplomatic sources said themeeting could last through several long nights of negotiation.    But Tornaes said any thought that success was notultimately possible would be a gesture of retreat at thisstage.    EC Commission sources said among the remaining problemswere appeals from Southern member states for protection fortheir small and relatively poor farmers, and calls from Franceand the Netherlands for significant changes to Commissionproposals for arable crops.    They added that West Germany appears still reluctant toaccept the idea of production ceilings being set at the levelof the EC as a whole rather than that of member states.    Meanwhile, the ministers made little progress in agreeing ascheme to top up the income of poorer farmers through directpayments, which could help to cushion the impact of stabiliserson them.    British minister John MacGregor told journalists :"Theproposals as they stand have very few friends."    He said a number of countries fear they could simplyencourage further unwanted production by giving farmers thecash to improve production methods. Reuter&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP, As official Washington sought torestore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Streetcollapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire fromcritics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank forboosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of aninternational accord to stabilize currency values.    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, wasamong those who said the treasury secretary's statements helpedspur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investorsthink that a clash between the two major economic powers woulddamage the world economy.    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, "Ithink the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, Ithink, was partly due to statements that have been made bysenior figures on the other side of the Atlantic." It was adispute that should never have happened, he added.    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at ahastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the UnitedStates on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip toScandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, "Histiming could not have been worse."    One government bond salesman in New York said, "He actuallythought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smackthe dollar down would work. That doesn't show muchunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship."    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn marchtoward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.    "On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but ifyou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financialmarkets), it was West German policy," said Robert Brusca ofNikko Securities International in New York.    "All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, somaking him responsible for it was a little like killing themessenger," he said.    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governmentsmade it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced togetherin Paris in February, was still in effect.    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might bea prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar tothe late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crashwiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy aboutBonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep theglobal recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interestrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59thmonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economicexpansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a hugemarket for debtor country exports.    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worriedthat the Republican party might face next year's presidentialelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badlytarnished.    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debtcrisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that hasalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.    "There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on theeconomy, and it's important that the psychology turn aroundquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, andeventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,"former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in atelevision interview.    In many ways, the official response was mild.    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,with President Reagan speaking for most people by admittingthat he was "puzzled."    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediatelyreturned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developmentsand, presumably, their political impact.    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status inWashington will diminish because of the market fall.    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll becauseof the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator LloydBentsen said with some irony, "Oh, I think it's much too late tobe doing that...You have an administration that's taken theattitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't dothat." Reuter&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, U.S. STOCK DROP SEEN SLOWING JAPANESE BUYING, A collapse in U.S. stock prices has  hitJapanese investors hard, since they had shifted to stocks frombonds earlier this year, and will slow down Japanese capitalflows to the U.S., investors and stock brokers said.   Until recently Japanese net purchases of U.S. stocks wereprojected to leap to eight to 12 billion dlrs this year fromfour billion dlrs in 1986, securities industry sources said.   "The Japanese had suffered severely from U.S. bondinvestments and now (they are suffering) in U.S. stocks," saidHiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd.    Japanese portfolio investment was concentrated in Treasurysecurities until early this year, which led to heavy currencylosses following the dollar's steep decline. Even though theirU.S. bond purchases moderated since then, Japanese investorscontinued to suffer losses as bond prices fell sharply inrecent months.    Now the historic fall in the U.S. stock market has stunnedJapanese investors, killing their appetite for U.S. stocks.    Keita Konishi of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co said while hisfirm was not panicked into an across-the-board sell-off of itsU.S. stock investments, he does not expect it to resume buyingstocks for some time.    There has been no panic selling by Japanese institutionalinvestors so far during the stock price nosedive, said SusumuUchiyama of Yamaichi Internatinal (America), Inc. Following thesteep decline, however, Japanese are not buying, even thoughU.S. stocks now appear bargain-priced, he said.    "There will be no big wave of Japanese investment in theU.S. for the time being," said Keiji Tsuda of Nissei BOT AssetManagement Corp, an investment advisory body to Nippon LifeInsurance Co.    "It's the time to think twice. The psychological impact (oninvestors' behaviour) will drag on considerably," he said.    The latest turmoil in the financial market was triggered byU.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker as he threatened a futherdollar fall in retaliation for higher West German interest raterises, and undermined foreign investors' confidence in thedollar, Tsuda said.    The U.S. economy is still sitting on the time bomb of hugebudget and trade deficits, he said, and investors' worries overthe twin problems have intensified.    "Before I thought the dollar's large fall (over the pasttwo years) would take out the detonator out of that bomb, butit hasn't," Tsuda said.    Investors and brokers said the Japanese for the first timehave experienced the enormous volatality of the New York stockmarket, often caused by "program trading."    A stock trader at Daiwa Securities America Inc said thatwhile Japanese investors had been attracted by American firms'superior performance relative to Japanese firms in terms ofearnings per share, U.S. stocks' downside potential is now muchlarger than that oJapanese stocks.    While the Japanese stock market has also taken a nosedive,it could be stabilized by the efforts of large Japanse firms.    A high percentage of Japanese equities are held bycompanies who will hold on to their stocks and the stocks ofother Japanese firms in order to strengthen their business tiesthrough this cross-holding relationship, analysts said.    Despite the massacare on the Wall Street, Japaneseinvestors are not expected to withdraw from U.S. stocks.    U.S. equities are in a process to be built indiversification of their portfolios and the portion of them isstill very small, Japanese investors said. But, it is unclearwhen the Japanese will resume purchasing U.S. stocks and muchdepends on the dollar's stability, they said.    Kondo of Yasuda Trust said Japanese investors are not fullyconvinced that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan isdetermined to fend the dollar's value and check futureinflation in the U.S.    Because of uncertainty over the dollar's direction andinflation in the U.S., Japanese investors have not yet jumpedon the Treasury bonds despite the latest sharp bond yieldrises, investors said.    Konishi of Sumitomo Life said "A U.S. recession is beingtalked about, so it may be time to shift back to bonds, but Ifeel uneasy about buying any U.S. instruments right now."    Tsuda of Nissei questioned the strength of the recent rallyin U.S. government bond prices. He said the steep bond marketrally has no real trend as bond prices are rising on shortcovering and bills are rising on temporary fund shift from thestock market. Reuter&#3;

Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering wellclear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontlineemirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.    "I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared thisconflict will escalate," a top West German Foreign Ministryofficial, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after atour of three Gulf states.b    Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six seacaptains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S.Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying theGulf.    Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulfwould stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S.Action.    But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tatassaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in thearea.    Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S.Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.    For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday thatit was ready for any further hostile action.

Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with his topeconomic advisers that he was prepared to order across theboard spending cuts to comply with a Federal balanced budgetlaw, but preferred to negotiate with Congress.    He said he would consider anything the congressionalleadership proposed, but a spokesman said he remains opposed toraising taxes as a way to reduce the deficit.    "I think it is preferable, if possible that the executiveand legislative branches reach a budget deficit reductionpackage. Accordingly, I am directing that discussions beundertaken with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress forthat purpose," Reagan said.    Asked whether he would consider raising taxes, Reagan said"I am willing to look at whatever proposal they might have."    As Reagan boarded the helicopter to visit his wife Nancy atBethesda Naval Hospital, he was questioned as to whether thatmeant he was softening on his tax stance. Reagan replied "if youheard that it must have been the helicopter."    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later told reportersthat Reagan was not changing his opposition to tax increases.Fitzwater said the administration would accept automatic cutsunder the Gramm Rudman balanced budget law rather than raisetaxes.    Earlier on Tuesday congressional leaders called for aneconomic summit with the White House to address the nation'sbudget and trade deficits that some analysts say were partly toblame for the stock market drop.    Reagan said he would be willing to participate personallyin any negotiations with Congress.    The White House earlier seemed to reject the idea ofnegotiating with Congress on the budget deficit.    Fitzwater said this morning that the White House continuedto oppose a budget summit with Congress on the grounds that itwould be used by Democrats as a platform to press for a taxincrease.

The exchange closed one-half hour early for the secondstraight day. Mann said the exchange will determine dailywhether or not to close early over the next several days.    Mann said the only major operational problem today occurredwhen the exchange had to stop trading 30 over-the-counteroptions, 17 of which trading were restored later in the day.    He said the options had to be halted because priceinformation on the underlying stocks was not being disseminatedon the floor quickly enough.    "You cannot trade an option, unless you know how much itsworth," he said.    Mann said the exchange's computer system was working betterthan had been expected under the pressure of the heavy tradingvolume.    "This system was not designed to do what it did today andyesterday," he said.    He said technical adjustments to the system since yesterdayimproved today's operations. He would not elaborate.    Mann said the decision to close the exchange early was notdue to concerns over the vulnerability of being open one halfhour after New York closed. Rather, he said, it was to allowtrades to be tallied in conformance with other exchanges.    In Los Angeles, traders said although trading was hectic,they were able to keep up with orders better than yesterday.    "We could handle the orders we got.

There was no comparable figure for the third quarter of1986 because the company was formed in June 1987 through themerger of RepublicBank Corp and Interfirst Corp.    Non-performing loans were 3.1 billion dlrs at the end ofSeptember, or 12.4 pct of total assets, mpared with 9.5 pctat the end of the second quarter.    Loans secured by real estate accounted for about 90 pct ofthe 706 mln dlr increase in non-performing loans in the thirdquarter, First Republicbank said.    It said the poor shape of the office and retail housingmarkets in Dallas, Houston and Austin will continue to holdback earnings.    "As indicated earlier in 1987 by First RepublicBank, thecompany will continue to assess future common stock dividendpayments relative to earnings performance," GeraldFronterhouse, chairman and chief executive officier, said in astatement.    First RepublicBank said its third-quarter loan lossprovision of 106 mln dlrs and net charge-offs of 87 mln dlrsleft its total allowance for credit losses at 1.14 billiondlrs, or 4.6 pct of the loan portfolio.    The company's primary capital amounted to 7.9 pct of assetsat the end of September.    The 6.3 mln dlr loss was sustained despite a 29 mln dlr cutin overhead, achieved partly by staff attrition. The size ofthe combined staffs of the two banks has been cut by 12 pct sofar this year, and Fronterhouse said the bank is ahead of theschedule it set for achieving savings through the merger.

reut2-020.sgm, U.S. MAY END ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN, The United States may lift anadditional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan laterthis month, Reagan Administration officials said.    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions onJapanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and thirdcountry markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct onJapanese color television sets, hand-held power tools andportable computers.    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  afterJapan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market atbelow production costs.    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memoryand recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.    The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of thesemiconductors in third countries, where they had been takingsales away from American-made semiconductors.    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions wouldbe lifted by the end of the month.    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening theclosed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliancewith the agreement earlier this week.

"(Reagan) fell for that siren song that you can cut taxeswithout cutting spending and that we would 'grow our way out ofthis,' and everything would be wonderful," Simon said, in anapparent reference to the massive U.S. budget deficit.    "Every time we hear that nonsense we ought to howl withpain as we were howling yesterday and are howling today," hesaid in an interview taped this afternoon for the MacNeilLehrer Newshour which will air at 1930 EDT (2330 GMT).    Simon, who held his post under presidents Nixon and Ford,said Reagan's tax cuts are positive for saving and investment.    And he blamed Congress for causing the U.S.'s fiscalproblems by putting self-interest ahead of national interest.    "It's not only the president. It's Congress ... underRepublicans and Democrats alike," he said. "They're a bunch ofhypocrites who have one credo -- that credo is 'more.'" Reuter&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, COMPUTER SYSTEMS STRAINED BY MARKET COLLAPSE, The nation's exchanges and brokeragehouses said their computers systems have been strained by theavalanche of trading triggered by the past week's stock marketcollapse.    And while the financial instry's hi-tech resources havebeen able to handle the crisis, the sudden surge in tradingvolume will likely force the exchanges and securities firms torevamp their computer systems and communications networksseveral years earlier than they had planned, industry officialssaid.    "We had already started certain processes to increase theNew York Stock Exchange's capacity," said Jim Squyres, aspokesman for the Securities Industry Automation Corp, whichruns the central computer network for the New York and AmericanStock Exchanges.    "We will have to seriously consider speeding that up," hesaid. After three straight days of record volume, however, manyexchanges were pushing their systems to untested limits. Andwhile the exchanges said their computers were handling thecrush, brokers and traders complained about lost trades anddelayed price quotes.    The most serious problems arose on Monday, when a recordfall of 508 points in the dow and volume of more than 600 mlnshares on the New york stock exchange stunned the entireindustry.    The American Stock Exchange's order-routing system crashedjust 10 minutes before trading closed. The Pacific StockExchange suspended business a half-hour early so it could catchup with a massive backlog of trades.    And the price-quote feed supplied by the NYSE was cut offseveral times during the day, leaving some traders with quotesthat were often 45 minutes behind the actual market.     Although the computers whirred away late into the night,the exchanges opened on time Tuesday and problems were fewer,even though NYSE volume swelled to 610 mln shares. Combinedvolume of the NYSE, American and over-the-counter exchangestopped 900 mln shares.    "I think we're equipped for this kind of trading," saidPaul Stevens, executive vice president of operations for theAmerican Stock Exchange.    "The problem is less the computers, which are handling thevolume, than the strain on people," he said.        "The computers might turn out to be the heroes of thiswhole thing," added DuWayne Peterson, executive vice presidentof technology at Merrill Lynch and Co Inc.    In fact, officials said the biggest constraint on tradingwas caused by some of the oldest machines on exchange floors,the card printers that issue the buy and sell orders.    But even as computer executives spoke with awe about theirsystems' ability to hold up under unprecedented pressure, theystarted to plan for the future.     "We had to do a lot of innovative things to handle thisvolume," said Squyres of the Securities Industry AutomationCorp (SIAC), which is jointly owned by the New York andAmerican Stock exchanges.    SIAC had planned to boost the capacity of its system by upto 50 pct by 1990. But that and other improvements will now bemade much earlier.    Meanwhile, New York Telephone Co said Monday's panicselling did not wreak havoc on its telephone system.    "It was a normally heavy business day," said companyspokesman Steve Marcus. Reuter&#3;

Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsedMonday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms inretaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti shipflying the American flag.    The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.resolve that Iran "cannot take military action against theUnited States with impunity."    Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics andset a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger rolein making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not requireReagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could leadto a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.    While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growingU.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagancomply with the War Powers Act.

reut2-020.sgm, STOCK MARKET'S FALL MAY BE BAD OMEN FOR REPUBLICANS, Monday's stock market collapse couldspell disaster for Republican hopes of retaining the WhiteHouse in 1988 -- if it proves to be the start of a generaleconomic downturn -- political experts said.    "The question is does the stock market (decline) signal animpending recession. If that is the case the Republicans willhave a very difficult time winning," independent politicalanalyst William Schneider told Reuters. "If the Democratsnominate anyone halfway credible they would win," he added.    Schneider's comments, on the heels of a 500-point declinein the bellwheter Dow Jones stock market average, reflected theold political adage that elections are almost always decided byvoters' feelings about their financial well being.    "There is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook andwe don't expect 1988 to be any different," says Donald Foley,the top spokesman for Missouri Representative RichardGephardt's Democratic presidential campaign.    Foley added that the five-year old stock market rally hasshown amazing resilience and "there's no telling where themarket will be by the end of the week."    President Reagan said he was puzzled by the day's events,but is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound.    "I think everyone is puzzled ... because all the businessindices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy," hetold reporters.    "I don't think anyone should panic because all the economicindicators are solid," he added.    But for the time being, the decline on Wall Street knockedthe underpinnings from his boasts that the record bull marketdemonstrates the wisdom of current economic policy.    It could also deprive the Republicans of a major argumentfor keeping the White House in their hands when PresidentReagan leaves office in January 1989.    It gives a hollow ring to the words used by Vice PresidentGeorge Bush just a week ago when he formally entered the WhiteHouse race.    "We have weathered the storm. Our economy has recovered tobe the strongest in history," Bush said in reference to therecovery from the 1981-82 recession that pushed unemployment toits highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s.    "We mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansionin our nation's recorded history," Bush bragged.    At midday, even as Wall Street was being battered by arecord selling panic, Reagan gave a glowing account of theeconomy's performance at a swearing in ceremony for his newCommerce Secretary, William Verity.    Indeed, the Labor Department reported earlier this monththat unemployment among American workers had fallen to aneight-year low of 5.9 pct in September, compared to seven pct ayear ago and a Post World War Two peak of 10.7 pct in December1982.    But with interest rates climbing steadily and noimprovement in the record U.S. trade deficit with the rest ofthe world, a number of economic experts have expressed doubtsabout the staying power of the current expansion.   Warnings of economic danger around the corner have been astaple of Democratic campaign speeches this year.    And Democratic party leaders here for an organizationalmeeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economywould be the determining factor in next year's election.    "The 1988 election will be decided, as most peacetimeelections are, on economic issues," said Michigan party chairmanRichard Weiner.    "In Ohio, people are uneasy. They want to know where theeconomy is going," added Ohio Democratic leader James Ruvulo.    American political history is replete with examples ofvoters throwing out incumbent officeholders when the economyturns sour -- most notably in 1932 when Democrat FranklinRoosevelt won a landslide triumph that ended 12 years ofRepublican rule and made the Democrats the nation's majorityparty for more than 40 years.    But political experts said that if Monday's stock declineturns out to be a temporary phenomena it will have no effect onthe 1988 election.    "Times change, conditions change," Schneider said.    Quoting legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel, Schneideradded, "Never make predictions, especially about the future." Reuter&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, TOKYO BROKERS SEE SHARP EARLY STOCK PRICE FALL, Stock market analysts polled before Tokyo'smarket opened on Tuesday said Wall Street's dramatic fall onMonday was overdone and although Tokyo would fall drasticallyat the opening it might stabilise later.    Factors affecting the Tokyo market are not the same asthose in New York, they said.    "Tokyo's market is completely different from New York," saida senior analyst at Nomura Securities. "We have no computer(program) selling, and much more stable share ownership than inNew York."    "The discount rate in Japan cannot rise," the senior Nomuraanalyst said.    He said the Tokyo Exchange's 225-share index may fall 1,000points on Tuesday, because of basic concern. It dropped 620.18points to 25,746.56 on Monday.    But he said a 1,000 point fall would be nothing compared toNew York. "New York overreacted, the dollar is rising -- thatshould be a positive sign for New York," he said.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange opens from 0900 local time (0000GMT) to 1500 local (0600 GMT).    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 508 points (or 22.5pct) to 1,738 on Monday, its biggest ever one day decline inboth absolute and percentage terms.    Simon Smithson, a Kleinwort Benson International shareanalyst, said Tokyo's market was likely to free fall in morningtrading but perhaps would stabilise later. He too predicted adrop of perhaps 1,000 points in the index today.    But he said overall economic conditions in the U.S. AndJapan were different. "The problems that pushed down the NewYork market, like the (U.S.) budget deficit, trade deficit andslow economic growth, do not exist in Japan," Smithson said.    However, a stocks fund manager at a major trust bank made amore gloomy prediction. "The situation is different in the twomarkets, but you cannot ignore New York," he said.    "Foreigners will be selling and the index funds will beselling," he said.    A fund manager at another Japanese trust bank said Monday'sNew York fall was completely out of the range of expectations.    "All we can do is wait now and see what happens. There seemto be no factors which would stop the fall. There is no way wecan invest now," he said. REUTER&#3;

"If we are right about the fundamentals, this thing shouldsettle down," Labrecque said at a news conference at theAmerican Bankers Associatioon annual convention here.    Labrecque also said the stock market drop could cause U.S.monetary officials to ease credit policies.    Inflation fears are exaggerated and Chase still believesinflation will not rise much beyond five percent this year,Labrecque said.   He said strong economic conditions would permit growth tocontinue well into 1988.    "I don't think the stock market will cause a recession,"Labrecque said.    He said he could not estimate what the impact on Chase fromthe stock market fall would be. Chase's stock price, however,dropped 23 pct, but other money center banks suffered evensharper losses.    Referring to the banking industry, he said: "We're talkingabout one day."    "These are strong institutions," he said. Labrecque said hedid not think the Federal Reserve Board would tighten monetarypolicy in view of the stock market's behavior.    "If there is a bias I expect it would be a little bit theother way," he said. Labrecque said the high U.S. budget deficitwas not the single most important factor behind the market'sworries.    He called for closer cooperation in economic policy by theUnited States, West Germany, Japan and Britain. Reuter&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, BRITAIN TAKES STRONG LINE ON EC FARM BUDGET PLAN, British foreign secretary Sir GeoffreyHowe told his EC colleagues on Monday that Britain wantsagreement by December on a detailed plan to curb EC farmspending if it is to sanction an increase in EC budgetaryresources.    British diplomatic sources quoted Howe as saying that anaccord containing detailed figures and involving immediatepenalties for farmers in the case of overproduction must bereached in advance of an EC heads of government summit meetingin December.    "We require numbers as well as words in all the commodityregimes," Howe was quoted as saying.    The EC Commission proposed last month a plan for "budgetarystabilisers" under which there would be reductions in guaranteedprices, restrictions of sales into intervention or increases incoresponsibility levies if output of individual commoditiesexceeded certain levels.    Britain has so far given the clearest backing to the idea,although several other EC states back it in outline.    Diplomats say Britain can exercise some leverage on theissue because the EC is in a severe budgetary crisis from whichit can only emerge if all 12 member states agree to revise thesystem by which it is financed.    The sources quoted Howe as saying: "An interim or partialsolution covering some elements of the Commission package wouldbe unacceptable to the United Kingdom."    They said he insisted that any penalties imposed on farmersfor exceeding production limits must take effect in the samemarketing year as the overproduction, rather than resulting ina price adjustment the following year.    Howe also said there should be no question of a specialfund which could top up EC farm coffers in the event of anunexpected development such as a major fall in the value of thedollar.    The Commission has suggested such a fund to deal withemergency situations.    French EC affairs minister Bernard Bosson told journaliststhat his country could not accept the idea that there should beno emergency reserve.    "The British position has become tougher," he said.    Howe was speaking at a meeting of EC foreign ministers,which discussed the future of EC finances, and which took placesimultaneously with a farm ministers' meeting to consider theCommission's farm spending proposals.    Before his meeting got under way, British agricultureminister John MacGregor said he backed the Commission proposalto set the 1988 cereals production ceiling at 155 mln tonnes. Reuter&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE, Trade Representative Clayton Yeuttersaid on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canadaand Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing theglobal trading system.    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set backworldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguayto liberalize the global trading system and to include in ittrade in agriculture and services such as banking.    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meetingmarking the second year of their bilateral accord. TheCanadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yetbeen approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually removetariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods andmany services.    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israelipacts "other countries have realized that if they want tocontinue to have access to the world's largest market, they hadbetter get serious about improving the GATT."    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasingshipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantiallyincrease the gross national products in both countries.    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts shouldserve as important precedents for progress in GATT.    Yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys toenhanced political and economic stability around the globe."    He said, "a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not onlyfor advanced industrial nations, but also for other countriesthat need to increase trade in order to better their standardsof living."    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progressmade in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting toprotectionism.    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congressthat would force the United States to take retaliatory actionsagainst nations with large trade surpluses with the UnitedStates if the countries practiced unfair trade.    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. tradedeficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is stillrising.    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard toresist, but the pending legislation would undermine PresidentReagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.    He said, "President Reagan will veto any bill that containsserious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained." Reuter&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, EC STATES ATTACK PLAN TO PENALISE FARMERS, EC agriculture ministers attackedplans to penalise farmers immediately it becomes clear thatcereals output is above standard norms, EC sources said.    They said this was the major criticism raised at a meetingof ministers which discussed Commission proposals for curbingspending on the cereals regime.    The Commission wants powers to cut guaranteed prices orraise the coresponsibility levy if output next harvest risesabove 155 mln tonnes.    The sources said several ministers complained that changingprice levels in the middle of a season would severely damagethe financial security of farmers.    But an EC Commission spokesman said farm commissioner FransAndriessen told them producers could not be guaranteed securityregardless of market circumstances.    The sources said there was a general acceptance of the needfor some output ceilings. However, the French and Dutchministers called for a maximum output for a wider range ofcereal crops, rather than for cereals alone.    The sources added West Germany wanted production ceilingsfor individual countries with excess production being paid forfrom national exchequers, but received no support for thisidea.    British farm minister John MacGregor told reporters hedetected more support for his position against the penalties onfarmers being administered through higher coresponsibilitylevies.    He said he believes increasing the levies would do nothingto increase EC cereals consumption whereas lower prices forfarmers could help in this direction. Reuter&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, U.S. STOCK DECLINE RENEWS DEBATE ABOUT FUTURES, Wall Street's biggest one-day drop since1914 has revived a bitter debate about whether moderninvestment techniques turn shifts in investor psychology intocolossal moves in share prices.    "The market has gotten away from the players," said DudleyEppel, vice president-equity trading at Donaldson Lufkin andJenrette Securities Corp. He says stock index futures andoptions have distorted the investment process.    But Wall Street professionals who work with index futuresand options insist the blame is misplaced.    Fischer Black, head of the trading and arbitrage divisionat Goldman, Sachs and Co, says so-called program tradingstrategies involving opposite positions in futures on stockindices and the underlying stocks deserve almost no blame fortoday's decline. "People have changed their minds about thefuture of the economy," he said. Another strategy, known asportfolio insurance, may have exagerated the decline to a smalldegree, said Black.    Eli Wachtel of Bear, Stearns and Co was emphatic. "I do notbelieve the drop was precipitated by portfolio insurance orexpanded by program trading."    "The only thing that will stop it in the end is the valueinvestor who comes in and says 'IBM still sells computers', andbuys for traditional reasons" said Jeffrey Miller of MillerTabak Hirsch and Co.    IBM &lt;IBM> fell 31 to 104 as the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage dropped more than 500 points.    Several years ago Miller's firm was one of the first topursue program trading strategies, seeking to lock in anautomatic profit by taking advantage of discrepancies in theprices of the futures and the underlying stocks. But he saidhis firm has not been involved in that since late last year.    Miller said some investors who were burned in the recentmarket declines may have miscalculated the effects of portfolioinsurance. He estimated 70 to 80 billion dlrs in invested fundsprior to the decline were hedged with futures.    The way portfolio insurance is used, Miller said, investorsat the time they protect their portfolios commit themselves toa future course of action such as buying a put option. Whilenegative news such as trade deficits and budget deficits buildfor months, the put options tend to be crowded into a narrowspan of time, because they are executed as the market starts tofall.    Miller said at present people can only guess how muchportfolio insurance is in use. He suggested some system ofdisclosure could put other investors on guard that the seedswere being planted that might add to a future decline.    But in any case Miller argued that index futures andoptions do not initiate market trends.    People like Eppel of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette weresteadfast in their criticism. "If I had my way there wouldn'tbe any index futures," he said. "They propelled the market upwhen nothing was going on and now we're paying the price."    Another irate trader, referring to IBM's 31 point drop,complained "what announcement did IBM make over the weekendthat made its stock drop 31 points?" IBM was as high as 175-7/8earlier this year.    Some economists agreed that the stock market could besending signals about the economy.  Allen Sinai, chiefeconomist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, told Reuters the 508point decline represented "a crisis of confidence.    "This is a a bona-fide financial crisis. The market isshowing panic. I suspect there is a wholesale deserting of ourmarkets by a lot of foreign investors."    Sinai said the crisis was caused by continuing U.S. budgetand trade deficits and by rising interest rates. "This is not asignal of the start of a recession, but a strong indicator thatone is coming if nothing is done in Washington to deal with thebudget and trade deficits," Sinai said.    Some market participants said redemptions by investors whoown mutual funds fueled the decline. But Steve Norwitz, aspokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates, a Baltimore-basedinvestment management firm, said redemptions and switches intomoney market funds by Price's one mln accounts amounted to lessthan two pct of assets. "It's not a rout by any means."       Norwitz said the company normally receives about 3,500telephone inquiries from its customers each day. On Friday, hesaid, when the Dow index fell 108 points the volme of callsrose to around 7,000 and today it exceeded that although he didnot have a precise number.    Ike Kerridge, an economist with the oilfield service firmBaker Hughes Inc., was one of several analysts who said theevaporation of billions of dollars of paper profits could alterconsumer behavior.    "This could be the trigger for a national recession whichwould be very unusual in an election year," Kerridge said. Reuter&#3;

News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in greatsecrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism byBaker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fearsthat the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over twopfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.    The announcement of the meeting, also attended byBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneouslyin Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New Yorkmarkets.    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policiesaccepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministryspokesman in Bonn said.    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the marketreacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interestrates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said thatWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged tocoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, withthe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulatingtheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budgetdeficit.    West German government sources said rising West Germanmoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvrepact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interestrates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been risingsince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fedraised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.    German yields have also risen over this period, but lessmarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged upshort-term rates by changing the terms on its securityrepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering themoney market.    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany'sinability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in theBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetarygrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,bank economists said.    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from thepragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to themore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity thismorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.    "They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too muchunder American fire," said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser atSwiss Bank Corp here.    "It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite asignificant retreat from its position," added Giles Keating,economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms ofthe Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pacton Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money marketeconomists said.    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbankdoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocationrate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indicationthat the meeting would take place, although the FinanceMinistry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked tocomment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvreaccord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying heassumed monetary cooperation would continue.    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left WestGermany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visitDenmark and Belgium. Reuter&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, EX-ARCO &lt;ARC> CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990, Dwindling global crude oil reserves andthe lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will sendthe world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former AtlanticRichfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.    "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Andersontold reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "Ibelieve we're going to see a change in the world oil markets intwo to three years because oil is becoming harder to find."    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oiland Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mlnbarrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.    "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape upone mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the MiddleEast," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where wewere in 1973 and 1979."    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 atabout 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.    "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn'tenough supply," he said. "There have been no major oildiscoveries for the past 15 to 20 years."    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major worlddiscovery, has already produced about five billion barrels ofoil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said. Reuter&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, ECONOMIST BATRA SEES NO REASON TO PANIC, Economist Ravi Batra, whose book warningof a crash on Wall Street has been a best seller all summer,said Monday's record-breaking market drop was no reason topanic.    "I think (investors) should stay in the market. Don'tpanic. The time to panic is two years from now," Batra, aprofessor at Southern Methodist University, told Reuters bytelephone from Pittsburgh, where he was to deliver a lecture atRockwell International Corp.    Batra's book, "The Great Depression of 1990," predicts thatthe increasing concentration of U.S. wealth will lead to adepression.     He said Monday's 508-point drop was set off by last week'snews of the trade deficit "and other things that added to thetotal jitters."     However, he called the fall a "mini-crash," due in part toa change in people's attitude to the market. "In the 1920s,people thought the market would never come down," he said, "Buttoday, people think it will come down at some point, andtherefore when it does, everyone wants to get out."     "It turns a mini-crash into a maxi-crash," he said, butadded that he did not see it falling any further.     He said he expects the government to announce by the endof the week an agreement with Japan and West Germany to bringinterest rates down.     "Once (interest rates) come down, the market will calmdown," he said, adding the government had other options, suchas acting on program trading, that it might be able to use tostabilize the market.     "But in two year's time, the government will run out ofoptions," he added. Reuter&#3;
reut2-020.sgm, BRAZIL WILL LIFT MORATORIUM ONLY AFTER BANK PACT, Brazil will only lift the partialmoratorium on its 113-billion-dlr foreign debt after an accordis reached with the private banks, the Finance Ministry said ina statement.    The statement said such agreement, currently beingnegotiated, must place the debt "within the terms proposed byBrazil on September 25."    Brazil proposed to the private creditors a refinancing ofthe interest on its foreign debt that have expired or willexpire up to 1989, totalling an overall 10.4 billion dlrs.    Brazil also proposed the end of spreads and conversion intobonds of part of the 70-billion dlrs owed to private banks.    Brazil in February stopped interest payments on about 68billion dlrs owed to private banks, and the Ministry statementissued on Monday said this would only be lifted "when an accordis reached."    The statement said that a token payment, which banks wantfrom the Brazil as a condition to discuss an agreement, "willonly be made when there is a major progress in thenegotiations."    Meanwhile, a World Bank mission arrived on Monday toanalyse the performance of the Brazilian economy after the newplan launched in July by Finance Minister Luiz Carlos BresserPereira. Reuter&#3;

reut2-020.sgm, JAPAN TO KEEP BUYING U.S. REAL ESTATE ACTIVELY, Active Japanese investment in U.S. realestate will continue despite a weak dollar because suchinvestments are strong hedges against inflation, financiers andreal estate industry experts said.    Addressing a conference on Japanese investment in U.S. realestate, Setsuya Tabuchi, chairman of Nomura Securities Co Ltd,said Japanese investors are extremely cautious about investingin Treasury securities because of currency losses suffered inthe past during the dollar's sharp decline.    But, he added, "Real estate is a hedge against inflation,so such investment will not decline."    Japanese total investment in U.S. real estate last year isestimated at around six billion dlrs, exceeding the fourbillion dlrs ploughed into U.S. equities, Arther Mitchell ofCoudert Brothers, a U.S. law firm, told the conference.    Adding in financing of real estate projects by Japanesebanks and leasing companies, the total aamount of Japanesefunds committed to U.S. real estate projects could reach 20billion dlrs in 1987, he said.   The dollar's fall has made U.S. property cheap, and exchangerisks are low because many Japanese firms are makinginvestments projected on a dollar/yen rate of 120-130, he said.    Panelists at the conference said Japanese are now lookingat a wider variety of real estate investments, includingdevelopment projects and suburban buildings.    Benjamin Lambert, chairman of Eastdil Realty Inc, said thesale of 50 pct of the company to Nomura last year was designedto expand its customer base to Japan through the securitieshouse's close ties with Japanese investors.    Participation in mortgage loans is becoming popular amongJapanese, panelists said. Mortgages can be made to disguiseactive purchases, and years later the loans can be convertedinto ownership of the property, they said. Reuter&#3;

As traders remained on the floors in San Francisco and LosAngeles, madly trying to balance their accounts long after theclose, Exchange Chairman Maurice Menn told a news conferencetrading will, nevertheless, begin on time tomorrow,at 0630 Pacific Daylight Time.    Menn told reporters the price of a seat on the exchangedropped to 86,000 dlrs today from 100,100 dlrs a week ago.    Menn said the day also saw 134,000 options contractstraded, compared to a record 202,000 contracts last friday.    Traders both in Los Angeles and San Francisco said volumewas curbed purely by their inability to fill orders and thechaos created by the exchange tape falling hours behind, makingit nearly impossible to get accurate price readings.    "If we would have been able to execute the orders we got,there would have been 20 mln shares traded," said RichardGoforth, a partner with Crowell Weedon and Co, who trades onthe Los Angles floor of the Pacific Exchange.    Traders in San Francisco said there were unconfirmedreports that one brokerage house alone turned away orders for50,000 shares they were unable to fill in late trading.    The traders and exchange officials said action on thePacific Exchange did not deviate from that in New York, withsome early buying giving way to panic selling through theclose, which left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down arecord 508 points.    "We pretty much mirrored what was going on in New York...they couldn't fill their orders and we knew we couldn't fillthem either," said Goforth.    While traders said they are bracing themselves for a loweropening tomorrow, Mann attributed today's dive to panickingyoung traders and to monetary policy and said the market shouldstill recover.    "It depends on what the politicians do...There's no reasonit cannot go back. This is an abnormality and there is nojustification for this. People are nervous," he said.    Mann noted he had never seen traders in San Francisco leaveon the floor so long after the close.    In Los Angeles, one office manager commented early in theday it was unusual to see traders on their feet.    "Usually, they're sitting down studying the market, but itsmoving so fast they don't have a chance," he said.

reut2-020.sgm, US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT, A proposal to require importedtropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrowand possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopesthe plan would be adopted this year.    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as anamendment to a farm spending reduction package.    "I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as givingAmerican consumers the information they need," he said.    Proponents of the measure, including the American SoybeanAssociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oilsare high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicatingtropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourageconsumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,Indonesia and the Philippines.    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal"blatantly discriminates" against imports, would be impossible todefend under international trade law and would harm relationswith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of theirsaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relativelylittle from tropical oils.    The committee voted largely along party lines, with threeDemocrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure. Reuter&#3;

He also saidthe NYSE will open tomorrow on time.    "The market underwent a significant fall and a significantdevaluation of assets of which we are all concerned," he said.    Speaking to reporters, Phelan listed several reasons whythe market fell today. He said stocks have been going up forfive years without a correction. He also blamed inflationfears, rising interest rates, a lower dollar and problems withIran. "All came together in a very nervous market" he said.    "It's the nearest thing to a meltdown that I ever want tosee," Phelan said. Phelan said what he meant by meltdown was asnowballing effect where selling fed on itself.    Phelan said the NYSE is going through its standardprocedures before trading begins tomorrow. Those proceduresinclude checking with member firms on their liquidity, marginpositions, and backlog. "We know of no firm that has asignificant problem, but that could change at any moment," hesaid.    Asked for advice for the average investor, Phelan said, "Wedo not know where the market will end up."    The Dow Jones Industrial average declined a record 508points to 1738.74. Volume was a record setting 605 mln shares,almost double the previous record.    Phelan, in response to a question on declines in foreignmarkets, said he believes there is no loss of confidence in theglobal economy. He added that the underlying fundamentals ofthe U.S. economy are still strong, and that corporate earningsalso continue to be firm.    Phelan explained today's record descent as being the resultof a confluence of factors, including the globalization ofmarkets and the proliferation of new securities instruments.    Those two factors alone have made the market more volatile,he said.    Phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the factthat there has been no major correction in the five-year bullmarket. He also pointed to rising tension in the Mideast Gulf.    The New York Stock Exchange was in constant contact withthe Securities and Exchange Commission about a possible halt inall trading on the exchange, Phelan said. "The consensus wasthat it is better to let the market try to work itself out," hesaid.    In addition, Phelan said that with the global nature oftrading there is no guarantee that halting trading on the NewYork Stock Exchange would have served any purpose. Phelan saidhe was in contact with the Treasury department, White House andthe Federal Reserve, but that the contact was made as a matterof routine. Reuter&#3;

White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a writtenstatement that Reagan "watched today with concern" the decline onWall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average plungedmore than 500 points.    The statement said Reagan had directed administrationofficials to consult with leading financial experts, includingthe chairmen of the Federal Reserve, the Securities andExchance Commission, and the New York Stock Exchange.    "These consultations confirm our view that the underlyingeconomy remains sound," Fitzwater said.    The White House statement, issued about 45 minutes afterthe stock market closed, appeared designed to calm investorsworried about U.S. economic propects.    "We are in the longest peacetime expansion in history.Employment is at the highest level ever. Manufacturing outputis up. The trade deficit, when adjusted for changes incurrencies, is steadily improving. And, as the chairman of theFederal Reserve Board has recently stated, there is no evidenceof a resurgence of inflation in the United States," Fitzwatersaid.       He said Reagan was keeping close watch on the markets inthe United States and in countries, where waves of sellingdeveloped on Monday.    "We will continue to closely monitor these developments,"Fitzwater said.    However, his three-paragraph statement gave no hint ofwhat, if any, action Reagan might take if the stock marketplunge continues.    The percentage drop of 22.6 percent on Monday was thesecond largest ever, exceeded only by the 24.4 percent drop onDec. 12, 1914.       It easily eclipsed the fall of 12.8 percent on Oct. 28,1929 which helped spark the Great Depression.    Reagan and his top advisers discussed the market crisis,which came on the same day American naval forces retaliated forlast Friday's alleged Iranian missile attack on a U.S. flaggedKuwaiti tanker in the Gulf, at a White House issues luncheon.

Prime Minister Branko Mikulic on Monday proposed new taxeshitting high income earners, moonlighters, property andinterest on savings as part of new government plans to rein inthe country's 123 pct inflation.    He also proposed price and wage restraint and the trimmingof repayments on the 20 billion dlr foreign debt in line withcurrency earning abiltiy.    "The taxes will anger many Yugoslavs struggling withsoaring prices and will be resisted in Parliament," a Westerndiplomatic source said. Yugoslav economists said Mikulic'sdraft plans left many questions unanswered.    "It was a list of goals, not concrete measures," said asenior Yugoslav economist at a leading Yugoslav researchinstitute.    The state news agency Tanjug was more optimistic. It saidthe proposals indicated "real economic reforms" were coming.    Further details of the program, which Mikulic summarised inParliament, are to appear in the days ahead, and the draft hasto be debated and voted on by deputies in November.    "The goals are good," a leading Belgrade economist said."No one can argue with that. But the million dollar question,as with all government programs here, is how they will beimplemented."    Zoran Popov, senior research fellow at The BelgradeInstitute for Industrial Economy said the existing system mademany of the proposals difficult to put into effect.    "A change in the the system of taxation requires changes inthe constitution," he said. "Mikulic's speech tells us what hewants to do, but not how."    "It may be anti-inflationary," one diplomat said. "But thequestion is how can you tax a black economy and how will thegovernment find out who has two jobs or more than one home."    Economists and diplomats said the proposals could beresisted by deputies from several of Yugoslavia's constituentrepublics and provinces in defence of regional interests.    Such resistance has blocked the nationwide implementationof federal government economic policy on many past occasions. Reuter&#3;

Morgan and Co Inc saidthird-quarter net income rose 3.6 pct to 219.2 mln dlrs, from211.5 mln a year earlier, partly because of reduced loan-lossprovisions and a lower income tax bill.
